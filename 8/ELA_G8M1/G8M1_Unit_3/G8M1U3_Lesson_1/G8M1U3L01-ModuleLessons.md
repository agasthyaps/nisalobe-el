Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.8.2 – Work Time A: Students closely read the author’s note for *Summer of the Mariposas*. During this close read, students focus on RI.8.2, identifying central idea of an informational text and analyzing its development. The Close Reading Guide lists the text excerpts, key questions to ask students, and instructional moves required. Continue to use discussion protocols (e.g., Think-Pair-Share, Conversation Cues, and total participation techniques) to engage all students in a collaborative discussion about the text.

- RI.8.1 – Work Time A: Students will identify evidence to support the analysis of central idea during the close reading

- RI.8.2 – Closing and Assessment A: Students will answer selected and constructed response questions about the central idea of the author’s note.

- RI.8.2 – Closing and Assessment A: Students will answer selected and constructed response questions about evidence that supports the central idea of the author’s note.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Invite students to identify central ideas in their independent research reading book.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In Unit 2, students extensively practiced identifying theme, analyzing its development, and writing objective summaries of literary text. In this lesson, students apply these skills to a nonfiction passage in order to identify central idea and analyze its development.

- Rather than identifying theme as in previous lessons, have students closely read to determine central idea and its development.

Support All Students

- Share with students the fact that legends often come out of real life events of people, and fictionalized tales are often created to teach some type of lesson (e.g., Malintzin and Cortés).

- Bring in visuals connected to the referenced sources, people, and places in the author’s note of *Summer of the Mariposas*, along with a short description of each one. ▲

- Students may need additional support in processing oral questions during the close reading. Allow time for students to think and/or write before sharing orally. ▲

- Students may need additional time to process the questions in the Culminating Task recording form. Preview these questions with students before the close reading. ▲

- Remind students of habits of character and use critique protocol to ensure that group critiques are kind, respectful, and constructive.

- This lesson is the first in a series of three that include built-out instruction for the use of Goal 2 Conversation Cues. Conversation Cues are questions to ask students that promote productive and equitable conversation (adapted from Michaels, Sarah and O’Connor, Cathy. *Talk Science Primer*. Cambridge, MA: TERC, 2012. http://inquiryproject.terc.edu/shared/pd/TalkScience_Primer.pdf. Based on Chapin, S., O’Connor, C., and Anderson, N. \[2009\]. *Classroom Discussions: Using Math Talk to Help Students Learn, Grades K–6*. Second Edition. Sausalito, CA: Math Solutions Publications). Goal 2 Conversation Cues encourage students to listen carefully to one another and seek to understand. Continue drawing on Goal 1 Conversation Cues, introduced in Unit 1, Lesson 1, and add Goal 2 Conversation Cues to more strategically promote productive and equitable conversation. As the modules progress, Goals 3 and 4 Conversation Cues are also introduced. To review the complete set of cues, refer to Overview–Conversation Cues on the Tools Page (http://eled.org/tools). Provide students with a thinking journal or scrap paper. The following are examples of the Goal 2 Conversation Cues in this unit and Module 2, Unit 1 (with expected responses):

- To help students listen carefully to one another and seek to understand:

“Who can repeat what your classmate said?”

“She said \_\_\_\_\_.”

“Who can tell us what your classmate said in your own words?”

“He was saying that \_\_\_\_\_.”

- To support ELLs, in this lesson, students participate in a close read of the author’s note section of *Summer of the Mariposas* to enhance students’ understanding of the author’s intentions and the novel’s themes. The thoughtful questions throughout the close read, as well as the questions on Close Reading Culminating Task: *Summer of the Mariposas*, Author’s Note direct students’ attention to central ideas, theme, and key details.

- ELLs may find it challenging to determine the central idea within a text and in general, may struggle with some portions of the close read. Previewing questions before the close read will increase students’ understanding of the text, and help to guide their reading.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6, 8.I.B.7, 8.I.B.8, and 8.II.A.1.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Close Reading Culminating Task forms to ensure students understand how a central idea is developed.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will take their mid-unit assessment, which will assess their ability to determine the meaning of unknown vocabulary, identify a central idea, and analyze the development of central idea.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.8.4a (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 1**

- Invite a student to guide the class through checking the definition of *juxtaposing* in a dictionary, and invite a student to add the word and definition to the **academic word wall**, with translations in home languages where appropriate (to place \[different things\] side by side \[as to compare them or contrast them or to create an interesting effect\]). Add the synopsis of *The Odyssey* (Homer’s epic of Odysseus’ 10-year struggle to return home after the Trojan War) to the **domain-specific word wall**. Then have students identify the meaning of *mitos y leyendas* (myths and legends) using a Spanish translation dictionary and add words to the **chart paper of Spanish words**, and the **domain-specific word wall**.

- Add any relevant notes to the vocabulary strategies on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart.**

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- To build listening and speaking skills alongside comprehension, invite students to turn to an elbow partner and paraphrase their understanding of a key concept in the learning target (e.g., *central idea, conveyed*) in one minute or less. Cue them to share out by saying, “Who can repeat what your classmate said?” and give them feedback on their language use and the accuracy of the paraphrase. Then, invite them to turn to their partner and summarize once again, this time in 30 seconds or less. Repeat the feedback process.

Work Time

A. Close Read: *Summer of the Mariposas*, Author’s Note – RI.8.2 (30 minutes)

- Review appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can determine a central idea and how it is conveyed through details in *Summer of the Mariposas*, author’s note.”

- Focus students on the Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart and remind them that digging into the text deeper can help them understand it better, so they are going to dig deeper into an excerpt of the text through close reading.

- Move students into predetermined triads.

- Direct students’ attention to the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**, and review what collaboration looks and sounds like.

- Use **Close Reading Guide: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Author’s Note** to set the purpose of the close read and to guide students through a close read of this excerpt. Refer to the guide for how to integrate the following:

- **Close Reading Culminating Task: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Author’s Note**

- **Affix list**

- Refer to **Close Reading Culminating Task: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Author’s Note (answers for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Use the following Goal 2 Conversation Cues as appropriate to prompt discussion:

“Who can repeat what your classmate said?”

“Who can tell us what your classmate said in your own words?”

- With students’ support, record the meanings of vocabulary words in the Close Read (*abhorrent* —inspiring disgust or loathing; *maligned* —spoken about in a spiteful or critical way; *redeem* —to compensate for the faults or bad aspects of something, to regain or repossess it) on the academic word wall, with translations in students’ home languages. Write synonyms or sketch a visual above each key term to scaffold students’ understanding. Invite students to record these words in their **vocabulary logs**.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time A, review Close Reading Culminating Task: *Summer of the Mariposas*, Author’s Note questions with students in advance of beginning the close read to help them anticipate key information needed for multiple choice questions and the partner summary, as they read. Keep multiple choice response options covered to maintain a lighter level of support.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time A, review Close Reading Culminating Task: *Summer of the Mariposas*, Author’s Note questions and multiple-choice answers with students in advance of beginning the close read to help them anticipate key information needed for multiple choice questions and the partner summary, as they read. Offer definitions for key vocabulary in the questions and responses to help students fully comprehend the meaning of each in order to find relevant content in the text.

Closing and Assessment

A. Culminating Task – RI.8.2 (10 minutes)

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What do you notice about the main ideas you have collected on your sticky notes? What does this tell you about the central idea of this text?” (McCall wrote the novel in order to highlight modern and ancient myths and legends of Mexico and to reimagine La Llorona to emphasize a theme that kindness and purity of heart can lead to a full and meaningful life—and even to redemption.)

- Display and distribute Close Reading Culminating Task: *Summer of the Mariposas*, Author’s Note. Invite students to work in pairs to answer the questions.

- Refocus the whole group and use total participation techniques (equity sticks or cold calling) to select students to share their responses with the whole group. Refer to Close Reading Culminating Task: *Summer of the Mariposas*, Author’s Note (answers for teacher reference) and clarify any misconceptions.

- Ensure students recognize that in order to determine central idea, readers need to pay careful attention to the main ideas and how they connect to one another to give the reader a sense of a larger central idea.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- For additional work with the close read text, create a list of rephrased ideas from the author’s note (e.g., *“My story was intended to help readers learn about the Aztecs’ magical history and folklore”*) and have students find the idea within the text. This will provide students with an opportunity to notice how central ideas are woven into non-literary texts and reinforce overall comprehension of the reading. This task will also provide additional practice with thinking about paraphrasing and how we can use different language to express the same idea.

Homework

A. Selected and Constructed Response Questions

- Using **Homework: Selected and Constructed Response Questions: Central Idea**, students answer selected and constructed response questions about the central idea of chapter 17 of *Summer of the Mariposas.*

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their independent reading journal.
