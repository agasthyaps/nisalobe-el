**Name:** **Date:**

- Guadalupe Garcia McCall wanted to write a story about her ancestors, the Aztecs, because she has always been fascinated by them, and she wanted to highlight modern and ancient Aztec myths and legends.

- McCall wanted to show La Llorona in a new way, as a more compassionate character, because she believes her story has been misrepresented at times, in history.

- The main reason McCall wrote this story is to celebrate the connection that mothers and their children have.
