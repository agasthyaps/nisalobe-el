English Language Learners: Grade 8: Module 1: Unit 3: Teaching Notes

Compare and Contrast Essay: *Summer of the Mariposas* and Latin American Folklore

Teaching Notes for Unit 3

Prioritize Lessons for Classrooms with Many ELLs

This unit contains two Language Dives that analyze sentences from a model compare and contrast essay. These Language Dives, which occur within Lessons 7 and 10, address essential elements of the compare and contrast essay format: a focus statement with an essay’s introduction and a reflection statement within a conclusion. Prioritize these lessons for ELLs to set students up for success in writing their end of unit assessment compare and contrast essay. In addition, work with the Painted Essay® structure in Lesson 6 is a fundamental component of this unit, as the Painted Essay® structure will help students, and ELLs in particular, to organize their ideas into clear, coherent essays.

Language Dives

In Lessons 7 and 10, students will participate in Language Dives that focus on sentences within Model Essay: Peuchen in preparation for carrying out compare and contrast essay writing. Within the practice portions of each of these Language Dives, students will have the opportunity to generate sentences that can be directly transferred to the Compare and Contrast La Llorona essay. A Language Dive empowers students to analyze, understand, and use the language of academic sentences, which can often seem opaque to students. During a Language Dive, slow down for 10–20 minutes to examine the meaning, purpose, and structure of a compelling sentence from a complex text, model, learning target, checklist, or rubric included in the curriculum. This process invites students to unpack complex syntax, or “academic phrases,” as a way to build both literacy and habits of mind. Students then apply their understanding of language structure as they work toward the assessments and performance task. Through the Language Dive’s engaging Deconstruct-Reconstruct-Practice routine, students play with “chunks” of the sentence, interpreting them, rearranging them, and using them to talk about their own lives or lesson content. As a result of paying close attention to how language works, all students begin to acquire the necessary facility with academic English, and ELLs foster their overall language ability. A consistent Language Dive routine is critical in helping all students learn how to decipher complex sentences and write their own.

Most Language Dives implicitly address a wide range of Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening, and Language standards. Once comfortable with Language Dives, consider supplementing the focus standards in a particular Language Dive with additional standards to meet their students’ needs. Note that the Rationale section of each Language Dive also identifies supporting standards that are explicitly addressed but are not the main focus of the Language Dive.

Note: Some responses to questions in the Language Dive indicate only that “Responses will vary.” Like one the larger goals of Language Dives, “Responses will vary” is intended to suggest that students should be encouraged to grapple with questions and ideas, develop interest and participation, and not be immediately steered toward “correct” responses. Indeed, even where correct responses are provided, continue to invite a culture of inquiry and grappling.

Diversity and Inclusion

Investigate the routines, practices, rituals, beliefs, norms, and experiences that are important to ELLs and their families. Integrate this background into the classroom as students explore the *Summer of the Mariposas* and *La Llorona* texts. Create a supportive and inclusive classroom environment by reminding students that everyone is working toward improvement. Be sure to highlight and praise growth and development rather than relative performance. Use as a topic or text warmer or reflection with the entire class: a check-in at any strategic point during the unit to continually connect students’ personal experience to the topic or text and to share how each one has changed and grown in association with the other. Invite students to share any cultural connections they may have made with the text to honor those whose own backgrounds may be similar to that of the Garza sisters, especially. The final chapters of the book contain events that explore challenging relationships within the Garza family. Foster inclusive action by creating space for students to express their feelings about sensitive issues embedded in the novel, knowing that these discussions may help create equity or unearth trauma, or both. Consult with a guidance counselor, school social worker, or ESL teacher for further investigation of diversity and inclusion.

Conversation Cues

Encourage productive and equitable conversation with Conversation Cues, which are questions to ask students that help achieve four goals:

- (Goal 1) encourage all students to talk and be understood;

- (Goal 2) listen carefully to one another and seek to understand;

- (Goal 3) deepen thinking; and

- (Goal 4) think with others to expand the conversation (adapted from Michaels, Sarah, and Cathy O’Connor. “Talk Science Primer.” The Inquiry Project, TERC, 2012, inquiryproject.terc.edu/shared/pd/TalkScience_Primer.pdf. Based on Chapin, Suzanne H., et al. Classroom Discussions: Using *Math Talk to Help Students Learn, Grades K–6*. 2nd ed, Math Solutions, 2009).

Refer to the Tools Page (http://eled.org/tools) for the complete set of cues. Goal 1 Conversation Cues are introduced in Unit 1, Lesson 1, and suggestions for integrating Conversation Cues into instruction are presented across lessons. For ELLs, Conversation Cues are especially critical because they improve language-processing abilities and increase engagement and participation.

Strategic Grouping

Students work in pairs and small groups during text-based discussions, Language Dives, and other tasks. For Language Dives and other tasks that focus on language, match ELLs with a partner who has greater language proficiency. For text-based discussions that focus on gist, point of view, characters, theme, and main ideas, pair ELLs with students who share the same home language to allow for rich discussion around ideas. The conversations that happen as a result of such strategic pairing will greatly serve the language development of both partners.

Text-Based Discussions

As in Units 1 and 2, break down content, share-outs, or tasks into two parts for ELLs: cognitive and linguistic. First, invite home language use to allow students to more comfortably process their ideas. This will allow students to first focus on the cognitive demands necessary to complete particularly demanding content, share-outs, or tasks. In addition, inviting home language use helps students build academic mindsets. After they have met the cognitive demands in their home language, they can be invited to discuss the task in classroom English, a language they are still learning.

Celebration

Celebrate the courage, enthusiasm, diversity, and bilingual assets that ELLs bring to the classroom. Additionally, students can celebrate their successful attempts at communication, focusing on progress, rather than perfection.
