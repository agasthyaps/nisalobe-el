Close Reading Guide:  
*Summer of the Mariposas*, Author’s Note

RI.8.1, RI.8.2

(For Teacher Reference)

**Purpose and Notes**

- The purpose of this close read is for students to determine the central idea of the author’s note in *Summer of the Mariposas* and identify how the central idea is developed in the excerpt. Students will use this information to write a summary as part of the closing of the lesson within which this close read is built.

- Although there is a lot of challenging vocabulary in this text, this close read focuses only on words needed to understand how the central idea is conveyed. Support with definitions of additional words as needed for basic comprehension.

- The vocabulary questions in this close read have been designed to reinforce the strategies introduced in previous lessons and prepare students for their mid-unit assessment. Encourage students to make these connections and to use a wide range of strategies to understand key words and phrases.

- There is no note-catcher for this close read; rather, students answer two multiple choice questions on the Culminating Task recording form.

- Students will answer the questions in predetermined triads.

- Continue to use discussion protocols (e.g., Think-Pair-Share, Conversation Cues, and total participation techniques) to engage all students in collaborative discussion about the text.

<li><p>Read the fifth excerpt of text.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “What do you think <strong>redeem</strong> means?” (to compensate for the faults or bad aspects of something, to regain or repossess it) “What words or phrases helped you understand this?” (“Tell ‘her side’ of the story”; “A mother’s love is pure”; “We all deserve a chance to make things right.”)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “How do McCall’s changes to the myth redeem La Llorona?” (McCall changes the La Llorona myth to say that the drowning of her children was an accident, not a murder, and that La Llorona deeply regrets failing her children—so much so that she punishes herself by protecting all children of Aztec bloodline. This purity of heart and kindness toward all children allows La Llorona to be redeemed—and she is even reunited with her children as a constellation in the sky!)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “What theme is McCall trying to convey through her modernization of La Llorona? How do you know?” (McCall wants to convey that being kind and pure of heart can lead to a fuller, more meaningful life—and can even lead to redemption! This is why McCall rewrote La Llorona, giving her a second chance to be pure and loving. “A mother’s love is pure, not selfish or malignant”; “As parents, we all make mistakes and we all deserve a chance to make things right”; “I wanted to celebrate the extraordinary bond between children and their mamas. Mothers are very important”; “Mothers are for love.”) Invite students to jot down this gist note next to the paragraph using sticky notes or writing directly in the margins.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “What do we learn about why the author wanted to write this novel?” (The author wanted to write this novel in order to reimagine La Llorona as kind and pure of heart in order to convey the theme that this leads to a fuller, more meaningful life and can bring redemption.)</p></li>
