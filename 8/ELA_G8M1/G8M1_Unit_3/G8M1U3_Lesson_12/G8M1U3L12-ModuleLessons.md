Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Opening A: Students review returned mid-unit assessments with feedback. The purpose of this is for students to have the opportunity to see how they performed in order to improve in their next assessment and to ask questions if they don’t understand the feedback.

- Work Time A: Students complete a task for the end of unit assessment: developing and finalizing the compare/contrast essay that they planned in Lesson 11 of Module 1, Unit 3 (RL.8.1, RL.8.9, RI.8.1, W.8.2, W.8.4, W.8.9a, W.8.10).

- W.8.2 – Closing and Assessment A: Students reflect on learning using the Track Progress: Informative Writing recording form. This exercise is meant to provide students time to formally keep track of and reflect on their own learning. This self-reflection supports metacognition, responsibility, and pride in work and learning.

- In this lesson, the habit of character focus is on working to become an effective learner. The characteristic that students practice is perseverance.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Have students write an additional essay independently to continue to practice the skills that have been scaffolded in this unit.

- Ask students to reflect on their growth or learning between the mid-unit assessment and the end of unit assessment, and ask students to create goals for the coming unit.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the second half of this unit, students have been analyzing a model and using their analysis to plan an informative essay. This lesson assesses those skills as students use their plans to compose a draft of their essays comparing and contrasting the original depiction of their monster in Latin American folklore and the modern depiction in their narratives about a scene in *Summer of the Mariposas*.

Support All Students

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment.

- For some students, this assessment may require more than the 30 minutes allotted. Provide time over multiple days if necessary.

- Provide students with individual photocopies of anchor charts for use during the End of Unit Assessment, and encourage students to annotate it to help with processing and planning writing. ▲

- To set themselves up for success for the end of unit assessment, students need to rely on the detailed planning they have done across the unit and all they have learned by practicing compare and contrast writing. Before administering the assessment, activate prior knowledge by reviewing the Compare and Contrast Painted Essay® anchor chart together. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson supports ELLs with an assessment that targets compare and contrast writing, a skill that students have been diligently preparing for throughout the unit. Students will write a compare and contrast essay comparing depictions of a monster in traditional Latin American folklore with their own modernization of the monster in a Unit 2 narrative writing task, based on the planning they carried out in Lesson 11.

- ELLs may find it challenging to transfer the planning they did in Lesson 11 to one, cohesive piece of writing. Encourage them to think chunk by chunk, and to apply what they have conceptualized to the assessment task. Remind them of the extensive preparation they have done to build confidence going into the task.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6, 8.I.B.7, 8.I.B.8, 8.I.C.10, 8.I.C.11, 8.I.C.12, 8.II.A.1, 8.II.A.2, and 8.II.C.6.

Assessment Guidance

- Assessment materials (student copy, answer key, student exemplar, teacher checklist) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback to students on this assessment, use the Informative Writing Checklist (see Assessment Overview and Resources) to complete the student Track Progress recording form. Make notes in the appropriate column for each criterion in a different color than student responses. There is also space provided to respond to student comments.

- Save a copy of the scored essays to use as a baseline assessment. These pieces can be used to measure the progress of individual students throughout the year, as well as to identify common instructional needs in a class.

- In this assessment, students are tracking progress toward anchor standard W.2: “Write informative/explanatory texts to examine and convey complex ideas and information clearly and accurately through the effective selection, organization, and analysis of content.”

Down the Road

- In the final two lessons of this module, students create a multimedia presentation explaining their narrative choices: modernizing a monster from Latino folklore and creating a new scene for *Summer of the Mariposas* with their modernized monster. Students copy their narratives and compare/contrast essays about the original and modernized depictions of their monster into the webpage software.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Return Mid-Unit 3 Assessments with Feedback (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 12.**

- Return students’ **mid-unit assessments with feedback**, and follow the same routine established in previous modules for students to review feedback and write their name on the board if they require support.

Opening

B. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Direct students’ attention to the posted learning targets, and select a volunteer to read them aloud:

“I can write an essay that compares and contrasts the depiction of a monster in folklore from Latin America and in my modernized narrative.”

- Remind students that they have seen these learning targets in the previous lessons. Invite students to discuss what they think they will be doing in this lesson and the purpose of this work.

Work Time

A. End of Unit 3 Assessment: Write a Compare and Contrast Essay – W.8.2 (30 minutes)

- Review appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can write an essay that compares and contrasts the depiction of a monster in folklore from Latin America and in my modernized narrative.”

- Invite students to retrieve the following materials:

- Read the prompt aloud as students follow along, reading silently. Answer clarifying questions.

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence. Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**, and review “perseverance” and what this looks and sounds like. Remind students that as they will be writing their full essay today, they may need to practice perseverance.

- Ask students to Turn and Talk:

“What aspects of perseverance will you work on during your assessment today?” (Answers will vary, but may include the following: I will stick with my task and stay focused. I will ask clarifying questions when I need to. I will avoid distraction.)

- Remind students that they planned this essay in the previous lessons, and focus their attention on their completed Compare and Contrast Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer.

- Invite students to begin the assessment.

- While students are taking the assessment, circulate to monitor and document their essay writing skills.
