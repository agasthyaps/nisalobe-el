Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.8.5 – Work Time B: Students develop and strengthen writing as needed by planning their second body paragraph.

- W.8.2.a – Work Time C: Students practice developing the topic with relevant, well-chosen facts, definitions, concrete details, quotations, or other information and examples by drafting their second body paragraph.

- W.8.5 – Closing and Assessment A: Students develop and strengthen their writing with the support of peer feedback and revisions.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners, focusing on a characteristic of their choice as they draft their paragraphs.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- If students are identifying the parts of the Proof Paragraphs and planning them with ease, draw their attention to specific sentences within the paragraphs and ask what the roles of the sentences are and what effect there would be in removing those sentences, as is shown in Work Time A.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lessons, students analyzed the structure of the model essay using the Painted Essay® template and wrote Proof Paragraph 1. They build on those foundations to plan their second Proof Paragraph in this lesson.

Support All Students

- Students may need additional support while planning and writing their Proof Paragraphs. Group those students to guide them in finding evidence to support their point. ▲

- During Work Time A and B, group ELLs with partners who have more advanced or native language proficiency. The partners with greater language proficiency can serve as a model, initiating discussions and providing implicit sentence frames, for example. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson concludes students’ reading of the novel, *Summer of the Mariposas*, and gives students time to design and write their Proof Paragraph 2 for the compare and contrast La Llorona essay in a supported format that includes use of a graphic organizer and targeted questions that direct students thinking. Students have the opportunity to exchange feedback during the Closing of the lesson, which is an opportunity for ELLs not only to receive feedback on their own work, but to also see examples of their peers’ writing.

- ELLs may find it challenging to organize their thinking in their Proof Paragraphs. If needed, encourage students to focus on writing the first sentence of each paragraph to capture the most essential information. A bulleted list of the rest of the information in each paragraph can be created for the time being, and students can return to writing full sentences later.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6, 8.I.B.7, 8.I.B.8, 8.IC.10, 8.I.C.11, and 8.I.C.12.

Assessment Guidance

- Throughout Work Time A, circulate to monitor students’ planning skills on the Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer. If necessary, collect this organizer to provide feedback to students who may need it before the following lesson.

- Throughout Work Time B, frequently review student work to ensure they are creating strong drafts for their essays that align to the Painted Essay® structure. Use common issues as whole group teaching points.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will plan and draft the conclusion paragraph of their essays, drawing on the work they did in planning their introduction and Proof Paragraphs, and especially their focus statement.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RL.8.3 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete **Unit 3, Lesson 3 Entrance Ticket**.

- When students are finished completing Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 9, use total participation techniques (cold calling or equity sticks) to select students to share their responses with the whole group. See **Unit 3, Lesson 3 Entrance Ticket (answers for teacher reference)**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read and Discuss *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 22 Excerpt (10 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same process as with previous lessons for students to read an excerpt from chapter 22 of ***Summer of the Mariposas***, using the **Text Guide: *Summer of the Mariposas*** **(for teacher reference)**. Instruct students to read the excerpt independently and support struggling students as needed. If students do not finish reading the excerpt within the allotted reading time, distribute **Synopsis: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Chapter 22** to each student to review the key details from the chapter. Then have students identify the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary, add words to the **chart paper of Spanish words**, reflect on their reading as they choose, and record the gist on **sticky notes** using the following resources as appropriate: **vocabulary logs** and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Gist: Papa apologizes, the sisters and mother are all close now.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What do you think is the invisible gift Papa brought?” (Papa’s sudden appearance and apology brought Odilia the closure and confidence she has needed. The author says, “It was at that very moment that I knew with certainty we would always be one, together forever, protecting our loved ones, braving the wind and illuminating the sky” \[334\].)

“Why is this a gift?” (This is a gift because Odilia is able to have closure on the fact that her father left her family and is able to realize that her mother and her sisters are her family, and they will support and love one another forever.)

“In what ways have the Garza girls grown in their ability to show compassion and/ or empathy to one another since the beginning of the book?” Refer to Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart, as needed. (Answers will vary, for example: The girls have become more understanding of their mother, and learn to appreciate her feelings and empathize with her in ways they could not appreciate at the beginning of the book. They are working together at the end of the book, as they support their mother and fight for their family, compared to how they fought each other all throughout the book.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time A, before students read the final chapter of the novel, engage them by having them make predictions about how they think the story will end based on events in previous chapters and the in-depth knowledge they have built of characters through their reading of the first 21 chapters. Use sentence starters to guide writing or speaking (e.g., *“I think Odilia will . . . ,” “The end of the book will be . . . ,” “I expect that . . . ”*).

Work Time

B. Plan Proof Paragraph 2 – W.8.5 (10 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can draft the second Proof Paragraph of a compare and contrast essay.”

- Direct students attention to the **Compare and Contrast Painted Essay® anchor chart**. Review the criteria for a Proof Paragraph that they generated during the Opening of Lesson 8.

- Invite students to retrieve the **Compare and Contrast Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer**.

- Display and invite students to retrieve the **Model Essay: “Peuchen.”** Explain to students that they will now analyze the second Proof Paragraph of the model essay to help them plan the Proof Paragraph 2 of their La Llorona essays.

- Using the headings from the Compare and Contrast Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer, invite students to work in pairs to analyze Proof Paragraph 2 of the model.

- Prompt students to Think-Pair-Share about the following questions:

“What is the main idea of the second Proof Paragraph?” (In Proof Paragraph 2, the author states the difference between the original peuchen from folklore of Latin America and her own retelling of this “monster.”)

“How does the author’s evidence from the texts support the ideas in the second Proof Paragraph?” (In Proof Paragraph 2, the author uses evidence about the female peuchen and her brother to show that although the characters may look the same, there is a major contrast between the depictions.)

“How does the author elaborate on her evidence?” (In Proof Paragraph 2, the author elaborates on how the differences she chose convey her theme.)

- Remind students that as they plan their Proof Paragraphs, they should explain how the evidence they have chosen supports their thinking.

- Invite students to retrieve the following Materials:

- Compare and Contrast Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer

- **Compare and Contrast La Llorona note-catcher**

- **Painted Essay® template**

- Tell students they are now ready to plan Proof Paragraph 2 of their La Llorona essays. Explain that in this lesson, they are planning and drafting the second Proof Paragraph, and they will draft the conclusion in the next lesson.

- Invite students to complete the planning for Proof Paragraph 2 on their Compare and Contrast Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer. As they finish, recommend that students orally rehearse the sentences they will use to write about their contrast point(s), evidence, and analysis with a partner.

- Circulate to support students as they plan and to identify common issues to use as whole group teaching points. Prompt them to identify the evidence they will use to show the differences between the two depictions of La Llorona. Students may reference *Summer of the Mariposas* and ***La Llorona*** **by Joe Hayes**.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

C. Draft Proof Paragraph 2 – W.8.2b (15 minutes)

- Review appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can draft the second Proof Paragraph of a compare and contrast essay.”

- Distribute word processors to students so that they may type their essays.

- Guide students through drafting their Proof Paragraphs. Use one or more of the following prompts to guide students through writing Proof Paragraph 2:

- How are La Llorona’s depictions in *Summer of the Mariposas* and in *La Llorona* different?

- Find a quote from both texts that demonstrates this difference.

- Elaborate on how these quotes from the text are showing this difference between the two depictions of La Llorona.

- How do the differences change certain characteristics of La Llorona? Why do you think these original characteristics of La Llorona were changed in *Summer of the Mariposas*?

- Refer to **Compare and Contrast La Llorona sample student response (for teacher reference)** for sample response.

- Invite students to work in pairs to write their second Proof Paragraph. Refer students to the Model Essay: “Peuchen,” the Compare and Contrast Painted Essay® anchor chart, and the Compare and Contrast Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer for the La Llorona essay as needed.

- Circulate and support students, prompting them to identify how their evidence supports the idea that the two depictions of La Llorona are in some ways different.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Closing and Assessment

A. Pair-Share – W.8.5 (5 minutes)

- Invite students to break into pairs. Students will share their second Proof Paragraph and provide feedback against relevant criteria on the **Informative Writing checklist** and Compare and Contrast Painted Essay® anchor chart. Ask for a volunteer pair and work with them to model this exchange, using prompts such as “What evidence did you use to support your point?” or “How did you explain how your evidence supports your point?”

- Focus students on the Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart and remind them of the habit of character recorded: respect, as students are sharing out their planning work and developing their understanding of the task.

- Invite pairs to begin discussion with each other and to revise their work as they discuss where necessary. Remind students that they should only revise when they agree with the feedback. Circle and monitor the discussions to ensure students each share their reasons and evidence.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, both in their work to be respectful partners, and the goal they picked from the Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart earlier in the lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- As in Lesson 8, have students use colored pencils to circle and underline criteria from the Informative Writing checklist on their partners’ graphic organizer. Invite students to identify and share, with their partner, two specific things the writer has done well and two specific things that are missing or could be improved. As students analyze their peers’ work in a structured and detailed way, they will increase their awareness and understanding of effective and ineffective writing.

For Heavier Support

- As in Lesson 8, prepare a list of language that students can employ while giving peer feedback that is directly relevant to Proof Paragraphs in compare and contrast writing. This will also help direct students’ attention to essential elements of their peers’ writing. Examples might include the following:

- “The (similarities/differences) in this Proof Paragraph are (clear/confusing/inaccurate).”

- “I think you need another (similarity/difference) in this Proof Paragraph.”

- “I think you need more/fewer (information/details/words) in this part and more in this part.”

- “Can you find an example from the text to support this (similarity/difference)?”

- “It is necessary to explain this idea further with more details.”

- “I like \_\_\_\_ because it . . . .”

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their independent reading journal.
