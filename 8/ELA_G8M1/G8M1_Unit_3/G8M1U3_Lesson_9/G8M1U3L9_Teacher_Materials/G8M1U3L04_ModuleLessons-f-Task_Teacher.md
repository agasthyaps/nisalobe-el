**Prompt:** What about the La Llorona from folklore of Latin American has Guadalupe Garcia McCall kept the same and what has she modernized in *Summer of the Mariposas*? Why?

**La Llorona**

Stories written today often use modernized elements of folklore tales because they are still meaningful today. In *Summer of the Mariposas*, Guadalupe Garcia McCall modernizes characters from Latin American folklore. She does this to create a message for modern readers. La Llorona is an important character in this story. In folklore, she is often shown as cruel and hateful. She is a jealous woman who was enraged when she saw her husband with another woman. She drowned her own children out of anger. In McCall’s telling, La Llorona has been modernized to convey a central theme. In her depiction of La Llorona, McCall maintained many characteristics of the original story so that it is recognizable, but modernized the tale by making La Llorona a caring and motherly character to illustrate the theme that being kind and pure of heart leads to a fuller, more meaningful life.

In some ways the two depictions are similar. In the traditional tale, the main character, Maria, chases after her children who have fallen into a river. She cannot save them. She is doomed to search endlessly for them, becoming the “weeping woman,” La Llorona. Mothers warn their own children not to play by the river or La Llorona might take them (Hayes 2). As in the original legend, when Odilia meets La Llorona, she is chasing a mirage of her children who fall into the river and drown. This modernized La Llorona explains to Odilia that this is her “fate, to search endlessly” for her children. Odilia quickly recognizes the woman as La Llorona, the ghostly figure whom all mothers warn against (McCall 46–49).

McCall also makes important changes to modernize her character. In the original legend, Maria considers herself better than others. When she saw her husband with another woman, she chooses to drown her own children out of spite (Hayes 1). In the traditional story, Maria’s pride and rage cause her to be cursed. Her punishment is eternal, and she grieves forever. There is no redemption. However, McCall re-imagines La Llorona as a woman who did not drown her own children. Instead, she had a fight with her husband. This caused the children to run away and fall into the river. La Llorona explains that, to pay for her mistake, she must “watch over the children of the sun.” She must care for all children of Aztec bloodline (McCall 49–51). In this modern tale, La Llorona is a caring mother who regrets having failed her own children. She pays for it by protecting all children. She does not suffer punishment forever. Instead, she uses her own pain to help other families. As a result, she becomes a “new constellation.” She is “forever reunited in the sky” with her children (McCall 325). La Llorona is redeemed. The new tale of La Llorona captures an important theme. The theme is that being pure of heart and loving can help us live fuller, more meaningful lives. Love is more powerful than pain and suffering.

McCall has kept elements of the legend of La Llorona the same. This is to make sure she is recognizable as the character from Latin American folklore. But she has also retold her story for a new purpose. She does not use the story to point out the danger of punishment that lasts forever. Instead, her story shows the important idea that being kind and pure of heart leads to a better life. Stories written today often contain modernized elements of folklore stories. This is because those elements are still meaningful and relevant today. La Llorona’s new character, and how she guides the journey of Odilia and her sisters, makes *Summer of the Mariposas* a novel that speaks to young people today.
