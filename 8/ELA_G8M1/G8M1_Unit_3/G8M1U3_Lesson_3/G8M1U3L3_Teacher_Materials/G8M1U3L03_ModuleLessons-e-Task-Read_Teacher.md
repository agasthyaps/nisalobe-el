Sample student response: *La Llorona* by Joe Hayes tells the story of Maria, whose actions resulted in her curse to be a weeping woman wandering endless in search of her children. The story tells how Maria was beautiful and thought herself to be better than everyone else. When she met a wealthy man who she thought was worthy to be her husband, she used tricks to get him to marry her. However, after they had two children, he would often leave her, eventually returning with another woman. In her rage, Maria threw her children in to the river, where they drowned. She quickly realized her mistake and tried to follow them, only to die herself. The story goes that she is heard endlessly wandering by the river, wailing for her children, and so “They no longer spoke of her as Maria. They called her La Llorona, the weeping woman.” This suggests the theme that pride and rage can lead to grief and damaging results because Maria’s pride and anger led to her eternal pain.
