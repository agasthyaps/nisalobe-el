Close Reading Guide: *La Llorona*

RI.8.1, RI.8.2, RL.8.3

(For Teacher Reference)

**Purpose and Notes**

- The purpose of this close read is for students to determine a theme of the text and identify how it is developed in the text. Students will use this information to write a summary.

- There is no note-catcher for this close read; rather, students answer two multiple choice questions and write a partner summary on Close Reading Culminating Task: *La Llorona*.

- Continue to use discussion protocols (e.g., Think-Pair-Share, Conversation Cues, and total participation techniques) to engage all students in collaborative discussion about the text.

<li><p>Focus students on the second and third paragraphs, and invite them to read them aloud chorally with you. Briefly explain that they will be looking more closely at each section of the text in order to determine a theme. If necessary, remind students that there is often more than one theme in a text and that a theme is the message(s) or main idea(s) relevant to the real world that the author wants the reader to take away from reading the literary text.</p></li>
<li><p>Explain that in order to determine theme, readers need to pay careful attention to what it is the author wants us to know about La Llorona and the observation about the world that we can see in this story.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “What do we learn about Maria in this paragraph?” (She is beautiful and proud—she thinks she is better than others.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “How can Maria be characterized?” (She is haughty and deceitful.)</p></li>
<li><p>Explain to students that the word <strong>hubris</strong> means excessive pride or self-confidence, and we might say that Maria had great hubris.</p></li>

<td><ul>
<li><p>Focus students on the seventh and eighth paragraphs, and invite them to reread the paragraph.</p></li>
<li><p>Explain to students that every story has a central conflict. A <strong>conflict</strong> is any struggle between the character and someone or something else (including, sometimes, himself). Often, the conflict is a challenge to be met or a problem to be solved. This type of conflict for the main character or characters is what drives each and every story—it is the focus of the story. Without it, the story would have no point or purpose. Often a conflict (or struggle, or problem), and the way the characters respond to and resolve it, can help us understand the message relevant to the real world that the author wants us to understand.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “What is the central conflict of this text, and how does Maria respond?” (Maria’s husband shows up with another woman and in her anger, Maria throws her children into the river, drowning them.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “Why might this have happened? What might the story be saying about the danger of pride and anger?” (This happened because Maria was too proud, and she acted out anger. The story seems to point out that action taken in anger can lead to terrible results for others.)</p></li>

<li><p>Ask: “Explain Maria’s demise. How is she transformed? What might the story be saying about the danger of pride and anger for the angry person herself?” (Maria is said to be transformed into a ghost, now called La Llorona, “The Weeping Woman,” who wanders endlessly weeping and searching for her children. She is cursed due to her choices and her punishment is eternal sadness, without redemption, as she serves as a warning to others. The story seems to point out that pride and anger lead to destruction and endless grief.)</p></li>
