Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RL.8.2 – Work Time A: Students will close read *La Llorona*. During this close read, students focus on theme and its development. The Close Reading Guide lists the text excerpts, key questions to ask students, and instructional moves required. Continue to use discussion protocols (e.g., Think-Pair-Share, Conversation Cues, and total participation techniques) to engage all students in a collaborative discussion about the text.

- RL.8.1 – Work Time A: Students will choose strong evidence to support their analysis of theme during the close read.

- RL.8.2 – Work Time B: Students work in pairs to write a summary paragraph for *La Llorona*.

- RL.8.1 – Work Time B: Students will choose details and evidence to support their summary paragraphs.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Invite students to write a summary paragraph for their independent research reading.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In Unit 2, students extensively practiced identifying theme, analyzing its development, and writing objective summaries about *Summer of the Mariposas*. In this lesson, students will apply these skills to a new passage in order to identify theme, analyze its development, and write an objective summary.

Support All Students

- Students may need additional support with recording their answers on their note-catchers. Seat those students in a group together for support when necessary.

- Students may need additional support in processing oral questions during the Close Reading. Allow time for students to think and/or write before sharing orally. ▲

- Students may need additional time to process the questions in the Culminating Task Recording form. Preview these questions with students before the close read. ▲

- Students may want additional time to discuss the legend of La Llorona. Ask an extension question. For example, “The girls in *Summer of the Mariposas* have been discovering over and over that things are not always as they seem. In *La Llorona*, La Llorona seems to bear full responsibility for her situation, but is that really true? What role does her husband play in the fate of La Llorona?”

- This lesson supports ELLs with a close read of an informational text about a figure from traditional Latin American folklore, La Llorona, whose legend is also woven throughout *Summer of the Mariposas*. This text will serve as a resource as students write a compare and contrast essay that addresses the similarities and differences between the original La Llorona legend outlined in the close read text and the modernized version portrayed in the novel. As such, the close read and its culminating tasks provide strong support for ELLs to understand this text, which is a critical ingredient for success in ultimately carrying out the connected essay writing task effectively in subsequent lessons.

- ELLs may find it challenging to digest detailed analysis of the text during the close read within the limited time available. Return to key information as needed in future lessons as students work together to write a compare and contrast essay based, in part, on the information in this text, using sticky notes, annotation, and other relevant strategies to earmark places in the text where students may benefit from further discussion or individual processing outside of the allotted close read time.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6, 8.I.B.7, 8.I.B.8, and 8.II.A.1.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Close Reading Culminating Task forms to ensure students understand how theme is developed and how to write an objective summary.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue to read *Summer of the Mariposas* and analyze the use of figurative language in the text,

Lesson Plan

Opening

Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 3**.

- Once all students are ready, prompt them to Turn and Talk about the question on their entrance ticket.

“What do we already know about the legend of La Llorona from *Summer of the Mariposas*?” (Answers will vary, but may include the following: During an argument with her husband, La Llorona’s children ran away. They fell into the river and drowned. She has visions of them and chases after them until they vanish. She forever mourns them. Legend says she threw her children in the river. Parents warn their children to stay away so La Llorona doesn’t throw them in the river.)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Close Read: *La Llorona* – RL.8.2 (25 minutes)

- Review appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can determine a theme and how it is conveyed through details in *La Llorona*.”

- Distribute ***La Llorona*** **by Joe Hayes**.

- Focus students on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart** and remind them that digging into the text deeper can help them understand it better, so they are going to dig deeper into an excerpt of the text through close reading.

- Move students into predetermined triads.

- Direct students’ attention to the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart** and review what collaboration looks and sounds like.

- Use **Close Reading Guide: *La Llorona*** to set the purpose of the close read and to guide students through a close read of this excerpt. Refer to the guide for how to integrate the following:

- **Close Reading Culminating Task: *La Llorona***

- Refer to **Close Reading Culminating Task: *La Llorona*** **(answers for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Use the following Goal 2 Conversation Cue as appropriate to prompt discussion and listening skills:

“Who can repeat what your classmate said?”

“Who can tell us what your classmate said in your own words?”

- With students’ support, record the meanings of vocabulary words in the Close Read (*conflict* —struggle between the character and someone or something else \[including, sometimes, himself\]; *demise* —death and ending, or a loss of life; *hubris* —excessive pride or self-confidence) on the **academic word wall**, with translations in students’ home languages. Write synonyms or sketch a visual above each key term to scaffold students’ understanding. Invite students to record these words in their **vocabulary logs**.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time A, review Close Reading Culminating Task: *La Llorona* questions with students in advance of beginning the close read to help them anticipate key information needed for multiple choice questions and the summary as they read. Keep multiple choice response options covered to maintain a lighter level of support.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time A, review Close Reading Culminating Task: *La Llorona* questions, as well as multiple choice answers, with students in advance of beginning the close read to help them anticipate key information needed for multiple choice questions and the partner summary as they read. Offer definitions for key vocabulary in the questions and responses (i.e., *character flaw, eventual, demise, bold, reckless, naive, humble, seized, pride, rage, grief, damaging*) to help students fully comprehend the meaning of each before finding relevant content in the text.

Work Time

B. Pair Write: Summary – RL.8.2 (10 minutes)

- Review appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can write an objective summary of *La Llorona*.”

- Move students into predetermined pairs. Prior to setting students out to work, ask them to review the Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart, citing ways in which they hope to show perseverance in today’s partner work. Use Close Reading Guide: *La Llorona* to prepare students to write their summary. Refer to the guide for how to integrate the Close Reading Culminating Task: *La Llorona*. Refer to Close Reading Culminating Task: *La Llorona* (answers for teacher reference) as necessary.

- As students complete Close Reading Culminating Task: *La Llorona*, direct them, as needed, to the **Strategies to Answer Selected Response anchor chart** and the **Criteria for an Effective Literary Summary anchor chart.**

Closing and Assessment

A. Reflect on Learning Targets (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

- Incorporate reflection on and awareness of the following academic mindsets: “I belong in this academic community,” and “This work has value for me.”

- Ask students to Turn and Talk:

“How did you contribute to this learning community today? How were the tasks you completed valuable to you?” (Possible responses: I helped the class notice a theme during the close read. I got more practice with summary writing.)

“What examples of perseverance did you see in your partner during Work Time B?” (Possible responses: I kept trying and I asked for help when I was stuck. I stayed on topic and supported our group work.)

Homework

A. Understanding Vocabulary

- Using **Homework: Informational Texts and Vocabulary**, students explain domain-specific and academic vocabulary from previous lessons in their own words. Then they use real-world examples to further explain to their reader.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students should preread chapters 18 and 19 of *Summer of the Mariposas* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.
