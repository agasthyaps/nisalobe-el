<td><p><strong>The Garza girls get into a physical altercation with the nagual and the lechuzas: “. . . I turned and kicked him in the stomach with such force that he fell to the ground” (187); “. . . she dug her sharp talons deeper into my chest” (205).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Both the nagual and the lechuzas are defeated with magic: “He lay on the ground helplessly paralyzed by the musical notes emanating from the pendant” (187); “Shorter and shorter it got, and slower and slower the lechuzas flew . . .” (210).</strong></p></td>

<p><strong>The nagual first appears to the girls disguised as a donkey: “He’s an evil man, a sorcerer, not a donkey, and he’s trying to trick us” (181).</strong></p>
<p><strong>The nagual wants to sacrifice the girls to lift the spell on him: “Your death will release me from this curse” (185).</strong></p>
