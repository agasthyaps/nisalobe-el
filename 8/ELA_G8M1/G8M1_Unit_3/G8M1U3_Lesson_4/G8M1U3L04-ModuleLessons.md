Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RL.8.3 – Opening A: Students will identify how incidents in *La Llorona* reveal aspects of a La Llorona’s character

- RL.8.3 – Work Time B: By comparing the depiction of La Llorona in *La Llorona* with the depiction in *Summer of the Mariposas*, students will analyze how these different depictions reveal different aspects of character.

- RL.8.9 – Work Time B: By comparing the depiction of La Llorona in *La Llorona* with the depiction in *Summer of the Mariposas*, students will analyze how McCall drew on myths and also rendered her story new.

- RL.8.1 – Work Time B: Students will choose strong evidence to support their comparison of the original myth of La Llorona and McCall’s reimagined telling.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- In Work Time A, students could write a journal entry from the point of view of one of the sisters in the scene with Papa in chapter 19.

- In Work Time B, students can replace the depiction of La Llorona in *Summer of the Mariposas*, with the depiction of La Llorona in *La Llorona*. Students can write and perform skits, draw visuals, create comic strips, journal entries, and other creative expressions that retell a scene from *Summer of the Mariposas* with the original depiction of La Llorona from Latin American folklore.

- Students might also create a T-chart comparing the way the sisters react to Papa’s appearance.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- The reading in this lesson builds on the previous lessons as students continue to read the *Summer of the Mariposas*, identify the gist of each chapter, and record new vocabulary in their vocabulary logs.

- In previous lessons, students read the model essay for gist and analyzed its purpose. Students read and summarized *La Llorona*. Students will use their analysis of *La Llorona* to draw comparisons between its depiction of La Llorona and how Guadalupe Garcia McCall modernized the depiction of La Llorona in *Summer of the Mariposas*.

Support All Students

- In Work Time A, consider the emotionally sensitive content in chapter 18. Students may struggle with reading about the dysfunction Papa has caused for his family by abandoning them and promising he will never leave again.

- In Work Time A, provide choice in how to carry out the reading portion of the lesson: some students may prefer to read independently and silently, while others (especially ELLs) may wish to read aloud in groups with peers and/or with support, while others may wish to read silently for a few pages and then process with a group. This format of choice could potentially be built into the reading time within each lesson. ▲

- As in previous lessons, in Work Time A, present additional options for recording gist rather than just the sticky notes, such as using a separate notebook, graphic organizer, using highlighters and annotating, or a voice recorder. Alternatively, give students options for expressing their understanding of gist (oral, written, drawing). Also, build in different options for expressing comprehension of the text (written reflection, voice recording, discussion with partners/groups). ▲

- Chapter 18 and 19 again bring up the potentially sensitive topic of the FBI, border patrol, and Child Protective Services. Additionally, the topic of abandonment is revisited when the girls encounter their father and must decide whether or not to accept and trust him again. Eventually, it becomes clear that Papa has a new wife and kids, and he again leaves the Garza girls. As this may be an emotional topic for some students, monitor students and determine whether issues are surfacing that need to be discussed in more detail as a whole group, in smaller groups, or independently. Consider reaching out to families if a particular topic is sensitive for a student.

- Note there is a differentiated version of the Compare and Contrast La Llorona note-catcher used in Work Time B in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- When grouping students in triads to draw comparisons in Work Time B, group ELLs with partners who have more advanced or native language proficiency. The partners with greater language proficiency can serve as a model, initiating discussions and providing implicit sentence frames, for example. Use the same triad grouping as Unit 2, Lessons 4–7 if this grouping was successful. This will support students in building trust and becoming more comfortable and confident with their peers. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson incorporates familiar practices and reading strategies during the in-class reading of the novel, creating a collaborative environment in which students exchange diverse insights and perspective as they compare the La Llorona legend in *La Llorona* and *Summer of the Mariposas*. The isolated focus on comparison, rather than both comparing and contrasting, compartmentalizes the task, which supports students in their developing ability to carry out the underlying cognitive tasks required for compare and contrast essay work in coming lessons and on the end of unit assessment.

- ELLs may find it challenging to compare versions of La Llorona. A differentiated note-catcher is provided for students who may need additional support. During the in-class reading, the dramatic events that occur in the novel’s storyline in chapter 19 related to the Garza family reunion may be sensitive for some students. ELLs may require additional support in navigating any challenging emotions that arise while reading and may benefit from the opportunity to process in home language groups or to reflect silently and independently, in writing, rather than in a discussion format.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6, 8.I.B.7, and 8.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- Throughout Work Time A, check student vocabulary logs for accountability in recording vocabulary.

- Check gist statements to ensure students are recording quick notes about what *Summer of the Mariposas* is mostly about.

- As students draw comparisons in triads in Work Time B, circulate to listen for misconceptions. Once complete, review students’ notebooks to ensure they are on the right track.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue to read *Summer of the Mariposas* and identify the gist of Chapter 20. Students will compare and contrast the depiction of La Llorona in the original story and in *Summer of the Mariposas*.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RL.8.3 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 4**

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine to focus students on the word *compare* (to note the similarity between two things) in the learning target and to use a dictionary to define the word. With students’ support, record the meaning of the word on the **academic word wall**. Invite students to record the word in their **vocabulary logs**.

- Students may also use the vocabulary strategies on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart** to deconstruct each term and add any relevant notes to the vocabulary strategies on this chart.

Work Time

A. Read *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapters 18–19 Excerpts (20 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same process as with previous lessons for students to read chapters 18 and 19 of ***Summer of the Mariposas***, using the **Text Guide: *Summer of the Mariposas*** **(for teacher reference)**. Instruct students to read the chapter independently and support struggling students as needed. If students do not finish reading the chapter within the allotted reading time, distribute **Synopsis: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Chapters 18–19** to each student to review the key details from the chapters. Then have students identify the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary, add words to the **chart paper of Spanish words**, reflect on their reading as they choose, and record the gist on **sticky notes** using the following resources as appropriate: vocabulary logs and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Gist, chapter 18: Papa is in the house when Mama and the girls return.

- Gist, chapter 19: Papa tries to kick Mama out of the house and move in his mistress and her daughters.

- Direct students to look at the Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart, reviewing aspects of the habit of integrity. Prompt students to Think-Pair-Share:

“In what ways did the Garza sisters show integrity in chapters 18 and 19 of *Summer of the Mariposas*?” (Answers will vary, but may include the following: The girls stood up for their mother and one another, resisting their father’s desire to take over the house.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

B. Model: Compare Depictions of La Llorona – RL.8.9 (5 minutes)

- Review appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can compare the depiction of La Llorona in *La Llorona* with the depiction in *Summer of the Mariposas*.”

- Remind students of the question they responded to as they entered the classroom on Unit 3, Lesson 3 Entrance Ticket:

“What do we already know about the legend of La Llorona from *Summer of the Mariposas*?”

- Prompt student to Think-Pair-Share:

“What are the characteristics of La Llorona in *La Llorona*?” (Responses may include the following: thinks she is the most beautiful woman, thinks she deserves the best, thinks she is better than everyone else, neglected by husband, angry and full of rage, resents children, throws children in the river, regrets throwing children in the river, and is grieving.)

- Confirm the correct answer and explain while using the descriptions in parentheses above.

- As students share, capture their responses on the board or invite volunteers to write their response on the board. Be sure to draw lines that come out of the circle and to write responses at the end of each line to form a web with responses all around the circle.

- Distribute and display the **Compare and Contrast La Llorona note-catcher**. Orient students to the handout. Be sure they notice that they will only be working with the left side (compare side) of the note-catcher in this lesson. This graphic organizer will help students to track and organize the similarities and differences in how the La Llorona legend is presented in the two texts. For ELLs and students who require additional support, the **Compare and Contrast La Llorona note-catcher** ▲can be used for this activity to guide students in articulating comparison and contrast points and in explaining how theme is impacted by McCall’s modernization of the La Llorona legend.

- Model how to complete the left side of the note-catcher by asking students to Think-Pair-Share about a similarity between the depictions of La Llorona in *La Llorona* and *Summer in the Mariposas*. See **Compare and Contrast La Llorona note-catcher (for teacher reference)**. If necessary, prompt students to deepen their understanding by sharing their ideas with peers. Ask Turn and Talk questions such as:

“Where can La Llorona be found in each text? What happens to La Llorona’s children in each text?”

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time B, as an alternative to using the Compare and Contrast La Llorona note-catcher ▲, consider displaying a list of categories or key phrases to help guide students’ thinking during the La Llorona comparison activity (e.g., *La Llorona’s appearance; La Llorona’s children; key events in the legend*).

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time B, as an additional alternative to using the Compare and Contrast La Llorona note-catcher ▲, display a list that includes accurate comparisons of the two versions of the La Llorona legend, as well as some red herrings. Students can choose appropriate items from the list to include in their own list of similarities between the informational text and the novel (e.g., *“In both stories, La Llorona’s children are drowned in a river,” “In both stories, La Llorona has not forgotten her children”*). Carrying out the task using this support will not only help students as they organize their thinking, but it will also create an opportunity for students to practice thinking about the meaning of isolated sentences as they evaluate items on the list.

Work Time

C. Partner Work: Compare Depictions of La Llorona – RL.8.9 (10 minutes)

- Ask students to take out copies of ***La Llorona*** **by Joe Hayes** and *Summer of the Mariposas*. Tell students that the purpose of this activity is to gather more facts and evidence from the two texts that reveal similarities in the two depictions of La Llorona.

- Instruct students to work with a partner to revisit *La Llorona* and *Summer of the Mariposas*, pages 46–49, searching for facts and evidence to record on their Compare and Contrast La Llorona note-catcher.

- Circulate and support students as they plan, prompting students to notice and record specific words and phrases from the texts that demonstrate the similarities between the depiction of La Llorona in *La Llorona* and the depiction in *Summer of the Mariposas*. Refer to the Compare and Contrast La Llorona note-catcher (for teacher reference).

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Closing and Assessment

A. Whole Group Share – RL.8.9 (5 minutes)

- Use a total participation technique to invite responses from the group:

“What are the similarities between the depiction of La Llorona in *La Llorona* and *Summer in the Mariposas*?” (Responses may include the following: Both include details of her legendary backstory. In both stories, parents warn children to stay away from the river so they are not attacked by La Llorona who is said to steal other children in her search of her own.)

- Invite a student to record students responses on an overhead display or board during the share-out to provide visual, written reinforcement of the similarities discussed. Encourage students to check their own list of comparisons against the group-compiled one and add any new facts or evidence that is shared. ▲ Refer to the Compare and Contrast La Llorona note-catcher (for teacher reference).

- If productive, use a Goal 2 Conversation Cue to encourage students to listen carefully:

“Who can repeat what your classmate said?” (Responses will vary.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

- Remind students that they will use the Compare and Contrast La Llorona note-catcher to plan their essay and ensure that they are meeting all criteria for a strong informative essay.

Homework

A. Compare and Contrast

- Using **Homework: Compare and Contrast Characters**, students compare and contrast two monsters from *Summer of the Mariposas* and use evidence from the text to support their claims.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their independent reading journal.
