Language Dive Guide: Model Essay:  
“Peuchen,” Paragraph 4

W.8.2f, W.8.4

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

My new version of the monster can help us see **that we live in a society of individuals from many different cultures and ethnic backgrounds, and we don’t all look the same.** (from paragraph 4 of “Model Essay: Peuchen” by C. Riley)

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps to address the daily learning target and W.8.2f and W.8.4 by showing how a reflection statement can follow from and support information presented throughout an essay. It contains a verb phrase that expresses reflection (**can help us see**) and a cause-effect relationship (**we live in a society of individuals from many different cultures, / and we don’t all look the same**), a pattern that illustrates how writers organize ideas to create clear and coherent reflection statements within conclusions.

- Supporting Standards: W.8.10, SL.8.1.

- Guiding Question: The sentence helps respond to the guiding question by addressing how and why we can modernize myths and traditional stories to be meaningful to today’s audiences.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses a verb phrase (**can help us see that**) with the purpose of expressing reflection and uses a cause-effect relationship pattern (**we live in a society of individuals from many different cultures, / and we don’t all look the same**) with the purpose of organizing a clear and coherent reflection.

- Invite students to discuss each chunk briefly, but encourage extended conversation and practice with the focus structure: **that we live in a society of individuals from many different cultures and ethnic backgrounds, and we don’t all look the same.**

- Practice and Transfer: After discussing the focus structure, students practice using it to discuss something in their lives. Students transfer their understanding of the meaning and structure of this sentence when writing the conclusion of their La Llorona compare and contrast essay and during the end of unit assessment while writing an informative compare and contrast essay about their own monsters.
