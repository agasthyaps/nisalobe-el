Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.8.2f – Opening A: Students analyze how an author provided a concluding section that follows from and supports the information or explanation presented.

- W.8.2a – Work Time A: Students participate in a Language Dive, analyzing how an author provided a concluding section that follows from and supports the information or explanation presented, and begin to plan their own focus statement that will do the same.

- W.8.5 – Work Time B: Students develop and strengthen writing as needed by planning their conclusions.

- W.8.2.a – Work Time C: Students practice providing a concluding section that follows from and supports the information or explanation presented by drafting their conclusion paragraphs.

- W.8.5 – Closing and Assessment A: Students develop and strengthen their writing with the support of peer feedback and revisions.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Gather a number of new texts with effective conclusions. Invite students to analyze these conclusions written by professionals to gather more criteria for an effective conclusion.

- If students are identifying the parts of their conclusion paragraphs and planning them with ease, draw their attention to specific sentences within the paragraphs and ask what the roles of the sentences are and what effect there would be in removing those sentences, as is shown in Work Time A.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the second half of this unit, students have been analyzing a model and using their analysis to plan their informative essays. This lesson continues those routines to finish planning and drafting the essay.

Support All Students

- In Work Time A, use strategic grouping during the Language Dive to form small groups of students who share the same home language, with one or more proficient native English speaking students added to each group to create a balance and range of similar and diverse perspectives on the structure of the English language. ▲

- Students may need additional support planning their conclusion paragraph. Group those students to guide them in restating the focus of the piece and reflecting. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson provides students with an in-depth look at a reflection statement from a model compare and contrast essay during a Language Dive and subsequent time spent applying new understanding about the structure and content of reflection statements directly to writing. Students will plan and draft a conclusion, including a reflection statement, for the compare and contrast La Llorona essay in triads, supported by a graphic organizer.

- ELLs may find it challenging to compose thoughtful and relevant reflection statements and may need continued reminders about essential information and structure when drafting conclusions. Additionally, ELLs may struggle to put their ideas into words. To aid this process, leave room for discussion in both English and home languages to allow students to generate ideas before writing.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6, 8.I.B.7, 8.I.B.8, 8.IC.10, 8.I.C.11, and 8.I.C.12.

Assessment Guidance

- During Work Time B, circulate to monitor students’ planning skills on the Compare and Contrast Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer. If necessary, collect this organizer to provide feedback to students so that students may reference their feedback as they write their next essay.

- During Work Time C, frequently review student work to ensure they are creating strong conclusion paragraphs that include all aspects of the Painted Essay® Conclusion. Use common issues as whole group teaching points.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will create their plan for their own Compare and Contrast monster essays.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.8.2f (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 10**.

- Invite students to share responses to the prompt in their entrance ticket. Ask students to Turn and Talk:

“What are the elements of an effective conclusion?” (Responses may include the following: has an effective conclusion paragraph, restates the focus statement and reasons, and reflects on why the author modernized the monster and what theme this conveys.)

- As students share, capture their responses on the **Compare and Contrast Painted Essay® anchor chart.**

- Confirm the correct answer(s) and explain while using the descriptions in parentheses above.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Language Dive: Model Essay: “Peuchen,” Paragraph 4 – W.8.2f (10 minutes)

- Review appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can plan and draft the conclusion of a compare and contrast essay with a strong reflection.”

- Tell students they will now participate in a Language Dive to explore the meaning and structure of a reflection in the conclusion of **Model Essay: “Peuchen**.”

- Reread aloud paragraph 4 of Model Essay: “Peuchen.”

- Focus students on the sentence:

- My new version of the monster can help us see that we live in a society of individuals from many different cultures and ethnic backgrounds, and we don’t all look the same.

- Use the **Language Dive Guide: Model Essay: “Peuchen,” Paragraph 4** to guide students through a Language Dive conversation about the sentence. Distribute and display the **Language Dive: Model Essay: “Peuchen,” Paragraph 4 note-catcher**, and the **Language Dive: Model Essay: “Peuchen,” Paragraph 4 sentence chunk strips.**

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

B. Plan Conclusion – W.8.5 (15 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can plan and draft the conclusion of a compare and contrast essay with a strong reflection.”

- Invite students to retrieve the **Compare and Contrast Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer.**

- Display and invite students to retrieve the Model Essay: “Peuchen.” Explain to students that they will first analyze the conclusion paragraph of the model essay to help them plan the conclusion paragraph for their La Llorona essays.

- Using the Compare and Contrast Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer, invite students to work in pairs to identify how the author rephrased the focus statement from the introductory paragraph, using different words, and reflected on the points they made throughout the essay.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What sentences did the author use to restate the focus of the piece?”

- Remind students that they began to explore the author’s reflection in the Language Dive. Read the remainder of the conclusion aloud to note how the author continues to reflect.

- Remind students that as they plan their conclusion paragraphs, they should explain why the author modernized La Llorona and the theme this depiction conveys. Ask students to refer to their notes from the activity they did on entering class.

- Invite students to retrieve the following materials:

- Compare and Contrast Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer

- **Compare and Contrast La Llorona note-catcher**

- **Painted Essay® template**

- Tell students they are now ready to plan their conclusions with their partner.

- Invite students to complete the planning for their conclusion on their Compare and Contrast Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer. As they finish, recommend that students orally rehearse the sentences they will use to restate the focus and reflect with a partner. Guide students to refer back to the practice portion of the Language Dive: Model Essay: “Peuchen,” Paragraph 4 note-catcher while planning their conclusions. ▲

- Circulate to support students as they plan and to identify common issues to use as whole group teaching points. Students may reference ***Summer of the Mariposas*** and ***La Llorona*** **by Joe Hayes.**

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time B, help students generate ideas as they plan their conclusions by providing examples of the types of information that can go in the conclusion of an essay. These include a restatement of the focus statement in different words, reflection statements, and final closing thoughts. Dissect the conclusion of Model Essay: “Peuchen” together to illustrate these possibilities, and encourage students to use a similar approach in their own conclusions.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time B, as in Lessons 7 and 8, cut the elements of the conclusion of the Model Essay: “Peuchen” into strips of paper. Students can glue each element to the appropriate place on a separate copy of the Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer to activate and reinforce their thinking about both the topic and structure before using this same graphic organizer to plan their own conclusions.

Work Time

C. Draft Conclusion – W.8.2f (10 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can plan and draft the conclusion of a compare and contrast essay with a strong reflection.”

- Distribute word processors to students so that they may type their essays.

- Guide students through drafting their conclusions. Consider using one or more of the following prompts to guide students through writing the reflection of their conclusion:

- “Why do you think folklore stories are modernized?” (Their messages are relevant.)

- “Why do you think Latin American folklore impacts Latino culture and identity?” (It includes history of the culture and the people.)

- “How does the depiction of La Llorona in *Summer of the Mariposas* illustrate a theme?” (She was kind to Odilia and encouraged her to make sure her sisters were pure of heart—being kind and pure of heart leads to a fuller, more meaningful life.)

- “Why is the story of La Llorona still important today?” (People can change when given the chance to redeem themselves.)

- Refer to **Compare and Contrast La Llorona sample student response** for sample response.

- Invite students to work in pairs to write their conclusion paragraphs. Refer students to the Model Essay: “Peuchen,” the Compare and Contrast Painted Essay® anchor chart, and the Compare and Contrast Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer for the La Llorona essay to write the conclusion paragraph.

- Prior to setting students out to work, ask them to review the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**, citing ways in which they hope to show perseverance in today’s partner work.

- Circulate and support students, prompting to reflect on the points in their essay and how it illustrates a theme.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Closing and Assessment

A. Pair-Share – W.8.5 (5 minutes)

- Invite students to find a new partner and work in pairs to share their drafts and provide feedback against relevant criteria on the Compare and Contrast Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer and the Compare and Contrast Painted Essay® anchor chart. Ask for a volunteer to participate in modeling this exchange, using prompts such as “How did you rephrase your focus statement using new words?” or “What is your reflection about this topic?” ▲

- Invite pairs to begin discussion with each other. Circle and monitor the discussions to ensure students each share their restated focus statement and reflection.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time. Prompt students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What examples of perseverance did you see in your partner during Work Time C?” (Possible responses: I saw that she kept trying and asked for help when she was stuck. She stayed on topic and supported our group work.)

Homework

A. Transitions

- Using **Homework: Selected and Constructed Response Questions: Draft a Conclusion and Transitions**, students answer selected and constructed response questions about transition words and phrases in a concluding paragraph.

B. Independent Research Reading
