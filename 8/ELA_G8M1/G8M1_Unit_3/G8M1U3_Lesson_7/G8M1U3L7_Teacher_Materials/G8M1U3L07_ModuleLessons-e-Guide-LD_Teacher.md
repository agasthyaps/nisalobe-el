**Sentence**

In the new scene I have written for *Summer of the Mariposas* modernizing the Peuchen, I have maintained many characteristics of the original monster so that it is recognizable, **but I have modernized the tale by writing in two Peuchens, a brother and sister,** to illustrate the theme that things are not always as they appear. (from paragraph 1 of Model Essay: “Peuchen” by C. Riley)

- Supporting Standards: W.8.10, SL.8.1

- Guiding Question: The sentence helps respond to the guiding question by directly addressing the question of how myths and traditional stories can be modernized to be meaningful to today’s audiences.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses linking words with the purpose of connecting ideas and organizing information within a focus statement.
