What is the first point that supports your focus statement?

In some ways the two stories are similar.

**Evidence**

What evidence from the texts supports this point?

Maria chases after her children who have fallen into a river.

She is “reaching out her arms” but cannot save them.

La Llorona endlessly searches for her children.

Mothers warn their own children not to play by the river. La Llorona “might snatch them” (Hayes 2).

When Odilia meets La Llorona, she is chasing a mirage of her children that fall into the river and drown.

La Llorona explains to Odilia that this is her “fate, to search endlessly” for her children.

Odilia recognizes La Llorona (McCall 46–49).

These details of La Llorona’s legend make the character recognizable.

**Proof Paragraph(s) for Point 2**

What is the next point that supports your focus statement?

McCall also makes important changes to make the character new and to change the purpose of her tale.

**  
Evidence**

What evidence from the texts supports this point?

Hayes’ Maria “thought she was better than everyone else.”

When she saw her husband with another woman, she “seized her two children and threw them into the river!” (Hayes 1). However,

McCall’s La Llorona did not drown her own children

She had a fight with her husband

The children run away and fall into the river

To pay for her mistake, she must “watch over the children of the sun.” These are all children of Aztec bloodline (McCall 49–51).

La Llorona “followed her heart”

Becomes a “new constellation”

She is “forever reunited in the sky” with her children (McCall 325)

How does this evidence support this point?

In the first story, Maria’s pride and rage cause a curse.

Punishment is eternal

There is no redemption

McCall’s La Llorona is a caring mother who regrets having failed her own children

She pays for it by protecting all children.

No punishment forever.

Helps other families to heal and become whole

Is redeemed

Theme is that being pure of heart and loving can help us live fuller, more meaningful lives

Conclusion

Restate your focus statement from the introduction.

McCall has kept elements of the legend of La Llorona to make sure that the character from Latin American folklore is recognizable. But she has also retold her story for a new purpose.

What are your further reflections on this topic?

She does not use the story to point out the danger of punishment that lasts forever.  
The new version of La Llorona can help us see that we can be kind and pure of heart, and we can have a more meaningful life. All of us, in any age, look for meaning in our lives.  
La Llorona’s new character, and how she guides the journey of Odilia and her sisters, makes *Summer of the Mariposas* a novel that speaks to young people today.
