<td colspan="2">When Guadalupe Garcia McCall modernized the story of La Llorona, she changed <strong>the character from a self-absorbed and entitled woman to someone who is caring, gentle, and thoughtful. Also, in <em>Summer of the Mariposas</em>, La Llorona’s children still drown, but McCall decided to make it an accident rather than something La Llorona did out of anger.</strong> By making these changes to the character, the original theme <strong>of the legend is changed in the novel. Instead of the message that there is no redemption for someone who acts out of hubris and rage, the novel presents the theme that love, compassion, and being “pure of heart” can have redemptive powers.</strong></td>
