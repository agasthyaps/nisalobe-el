(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, answer the following questions.

Read the following sentence:

“The thin **rivulet** of a tear fell quietly down her pale cheekbone, disappearing into the darkness” (323).

From the context, what do you think **rivulet** means? Explain your thinking.

Student responses will vary, but may include how the word *thin* precedes the word *rivulet*, so we can infer that a rivulet is small. The sentence also says that a rivulet “of a tear fell.” A rivulet must contain water. If it is falling down quietly, it must not be very large or wide. Moreover, the suffix *-let* means small (e.g., *anklet*, *starlet*, *booklet*), and since there is a tear, which contains water, *riv-* could refer to a river.

What word(s) could you replace it with to have a similar meaning?

small river
