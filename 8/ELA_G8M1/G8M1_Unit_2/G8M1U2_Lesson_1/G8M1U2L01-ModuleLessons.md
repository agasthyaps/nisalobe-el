Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of the Lesson

- RL.8.2 – Work Time B: Students will examine a sentence through a Language Dive that relates to the development of central theme in the chapter.

- RL.8.2 – Work Time C: Students will analyze a model summary. Students study a model summary of chapter 12 and brainstorm the components of effective summaries, noting how summaries begin with the central idea, use concise details to explain it, and end with a theme statement.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Students may go back to previous chapters of the book and analyze how previously identified themes were developed throughout the earlier chapters of the story. Additionally, invite students to write summaries of previous chapters or sections of the book for extended practice.

- If there is time, students may begin the homework assignment in class to ensure that students have the time and space to practice.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In Unit 1 students identified the meaning of *theme* and looked for important themes in *Summer of the Mariposas*. Students will now build on this skill by analyzing the way in which the author develops these themes throughout the text.

Support All Students

- In Work Time B, use strategic grouping during the Language Dive to form small groups of students who share the same home language, with one or more proficient native English-speaking students added to each group to create a balance and range of similar and diverse perspectives on the structure of the English language. ▲

- Students may need additional support to write a summary and/or to understand the difference between summarizing and paraphrasing. Place those who will need additional support in one group. This support could include discussion or examples of the differences between summary (a brief statement of the main points of the text; generally much shorter than the original) and paraphrasing (a rewording of a single idea without removing information or adding new information; generally the same length as the original) and more guidance on how to write a high-quality summary (refer to the Criteria for an Effective Literary Summary anchor chart). ▲

- Note that there is a Synopsis: *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 13 ▲ in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. This resource should only be used as necessary for students who need support. ▲

- Chapter 13 again references the goddess Tonantzin, the magical lullaby the girls sang, the ghost La Llorona, the seer Teresita, and evil owl lechuzas who appear to attack the girls. As previously noted, supernatural content may be scary or may be a restricted topic for some students. Allow for time to process and respond to these topics during discussion, and to reach out to families as needed.

- To support ELLs, this lesson allows for in-depth work with both theme and summary. A Language Dive that centers on a sentence from chapter 13 of *Summer of the Mariposas* gives students an opportunity to think about theme, conditional mood, and pronoun structures. In Work Time C, the study of summary writing is scaffolded; students analyze a model summary to gain insight into the essential components of this type of writing before applying this knowledge to their own work.

- ELLs may find it challenging to bring together and apply the range of language sub-skills across both reading and writing necessary for summary writing. While reviewing effective characteristics of summaries, it may be helpful to provide models of summaries in students’ home languages, if possible, to help students understand the concept of summarizing, without linguistic interference.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.A.1, 8.I.A.4, 8.I.B.6, 8.I.B.7, 8.I.B.8, 8.I.C.12, 8.II.A.1, and 8.II.A.1.

Assessment Guidance

- Review student summaries when they turn in their homework to check whether they are on the right track. Use common issues as teaching points for the whole group in the next lesson.

- In their homework, students answer a series of selected response questions related to the development of theme in chapter 13. They will then try to emulate the model summary from class by writing their own summary of chapter 13 of *Summer of the Mariposas* (RL.8.1, RL.8.2).

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue to practice the skills of identifying theme and tracing its development as well as building strong summaries. Students will be assessed on their use of these skills on the mid-unit assessment in Lesson 4.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 1**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine to focus students on the words *analyze* (to separate into parts for close study; examine and explain), *characteristics* (features or qualities of something), *effective* (successful in producing a desired or intended result), and *literary* (having to do with literature) and to use a dictionary to define the words or the vocabulary strategies on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart**. With students’ support, record the meanings of these words on the **academic word wall**. Invite students to record the words in their **vocabulary logs**.

- Help students generalize skills across units by asking them to share one strategy or skill they learned in the previous unit that might help them to reach this lesson’s learning targets. ▲

Work Time

A. Read *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 13 Excerpt (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same process as with previous lessons for students to read the excerpt of chapter 13 of ***Summer of the Mariposas***, using the **Text Guide:** ***Summer of the Mariposas*** **(for teacher reference)**. Instruct students to read the excerpt independently, and support struggling students as needed. Then have students identify the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary, add words to the **chart paper of Spanish words**, reflect on their reading as they choose, and record the gist on **sticky notes** using the following resources as appropriate: vocabulary logs and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- For ELLs and students who require additional support, **Synopsis: *Summer of the Mariposas*** **Chapter 13** ▲ can be used to review the key details from the chapter.

- Gist: The sisters encounter and fight off the coven of *lechuzas*.

- Direct students’ attention to the **Determine Themes: *Summer of the Mariposas*** **anchor chart** and remind them that they have already identified two prominent themes in the *Summer of the Mariposas*.

- Review the Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 1 to set students up for the forthcoming Language Dive. Ask students to Turn and Talk about the words they used to fill in the sentences.

- Invite students to Pair-Share the words they selected to complete the sentence as well as the rationale for choosing those words.

- Confirm that, in fact, the two words that complete the sentence are *noble* and *kind*.

- Ask:

“What does *noble* mean?” (Showing strong character such as caring for others—even at one’s own expense—or exemplifying high moral ideals such as honesty and kindness.)

- Briefly explain that they will revisit this sentence and the one that follows it during the Language Dive.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

B. Language Dive: Theme in *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 13 – RL.8.2 (10 minutes)

- Review appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze how a theme is developed through details in chapter 13 of *Summer of the Mariposas*.”

- Tell students they will now participate in a Language Dive to explore language structures used in chapter 13 of *Summer of the Mariposas* to convey theme.

- Reread aloud the following excerpt from page 194 of *Summer of the Mariposas*:

“La Llorona said we have to remain noble and kind. If we do that, everything will be all right.”

- Focus students on the sentence:

- If we do that, everything will be all right.

- Use the **Language Dive Guide: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Page 194** to guide students through a Language Dive conversation about the sentence. Distribute and display the **Language Dive: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Page 194 note-catcher** and the **Language Dive: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Page 194 sentence chunk strips**.

- At the close of the Language Dive, ask students to make connections between La Llorona’s comment on being “noble and kind” and the habit of Becoming Ethical People. (Refer to the Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart as needed).

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“How does being ‘noble and kind’ relate to being an ethical person? What connections can you make between this habit and La Llorona’s direction?” (Student answers will vary, but could be along the lines of showing kindness to one another and other people they meet is similar to having compassion for others).

- Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target, using a check for understanding technique for example showing thumbs-up or traffic light signal cards. Scan student responses and make a note of students who might need support. Check in with them moving forward.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time B, during the Language Dive, for additional support with understanding how pronouns function in English, engage students in a short discussion about the sentences: “If we do that, everything will be all right. La Llorona said we have to remain noble and kind.” Display the sentences on the board or an overhead and ask students, “What happens if we switch the order of these sentences? Does the meaning still make sense?” (No, because the pronoun “that” needs to be in a clause or sentence that comes after the word or phrase it is replacing in order to make sense.)

Work Time

C. Mini Lesson: Analyze a Model Summary – RL.8.2 (10 minutes)

- Review appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze a model to identify characteristics of an effective literary summary.”

- Explain that students are going to look at a model summary to determine the criteria of an effective summary.

- Direct students to Turn and Talk about the following questions:

“What are literary summaries?”

“What do you already know about literary summaries, and/or about creating them?”

- Remind students that summaries briefly give us the central idea(s) and a few key details of a text so we can determine whether we need to read it when looking for evidence to support thinking, discussion, or writing later on. Summaries also help us quickly remember what the text is about when describing it to others.

- Distribute the **Summarize a Literary Text Rubric handout,** and provide time for students to read through the rubric silently or in pairs.

- Display the **Criteria for an Effective Literary Summary anchor chart**, which includes a model summary of chapter 12 of *Summer of the Mariposas*. Cover up the bottom portion that lists the criteria until students have identified them.

- Invite students to read the model aloud chorally.

- Have students Think-Pair-Share, leaving adequate time for each partner to think and for each to share about the following question:

“Based on this first read, what are some of the key characteristics of an effective summary?” (Title of the text, a few of the main events, the central idea and a theme statement.)

- As students share out the characteristics, reveal the criteria list on the bottom of the anchor chart.

- Tell students they will now look for evidence of each criterion.

- Read through each criterion and invite students to Think-Pair-Share where they see evidence in the model paragraph.

- As students share out, capture their responses on the Criteria for an Effective Literary Summary anchor chart. Annotate the summary with a corresponding code for each criterion (e.g., “I” for “introduction).

- Briefly explain that a theme statement is not a requirement of a summary and not all summaries that they write will include this type of analysis. However, this approach of ending with a theme statement helps them make a connection between summarizing and analysis.

- Remind students that when writing paragraphs such as a summary, they should write in complete sentences.

- Tell students that for their homework they are going to write a summary of *Summer of the Mariposas*, chapter 13. Give them 1 minute to think. Then invite partner B to orally summarize the chapter to partner A. Refocus the whole group and have partners switch roles. Invite students to jot down any notes they would like to take in preparation for their homework. ▲

- Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target, using a checking for understanding technique—for example, thumbs-up or traffic light signal cards. Scan student responses and make a note of students who might need support. Check in with them moving forward.

- Distribute the Unit 2 homework resource **Selected Response Questions: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Chapter 13** and review the format of the document and the specific assignment with students.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time C, color-code the criteria for an effective summary on the Criteria for an Effective Summary anchor chart, and have students use colored markers to identify these components in the model summary. Extend this by having students use the same color-coding for summaries they will write for homework to connect and reinforce how the components are organized structurally.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time C, display an example of a paraphrase (a rewording of a single idea without removing information or adding new information; generally the same length as the original) and example of a short summary (explaining the central ideas of a piece of writing in one’s own words; shorter than the original) from an excerpt from the novel, side-by-side with a list of criteria for each. If time allows, invite students to highlight the criteria within both examples. This will help to draw attention to the differences between these two writing practices and reinforce the key elements of each one. To extend support, create a list of short summaries and paraphrases and have students determine which is which.

Closing and Assessment

A. Reflect on Learning Target (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

- Incorporate reflection on and awareness of the following academic mindsets: “I belong in this academic community,” and “This work has value for me.”

- Ask students to Turn and Talk:

“How did you contribute to this learning community today? How were the tasks you completed valuable to you?” (Possible responses: I shared my ideas with my classmate and helped him/her to understand summary writing. I also have a better understanding of theme, which will help while I read *Summer of the Mariposas*.)

Homework

A. Write a Summary

Using **Homework: Selected Response Questions: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Chapter 13**, students will make their first attempt at writing a summary of chapter 13.

B. Preread Anchor Text

Students should preread chapter 14 of *Summer of the Mariposas* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.
