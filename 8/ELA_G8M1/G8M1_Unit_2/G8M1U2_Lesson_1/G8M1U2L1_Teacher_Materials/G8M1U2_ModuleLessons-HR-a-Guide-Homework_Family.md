![](media/image1.png) Guiding Questions and Big Ideas

Why do we see evidence of myths and traditional stories in modern narratives?

- *Elements of myths and traditional stories often form the basis of modern narratives.*

- *We can learn about other cultures through engaging modern renderings of myths and traditional stories from other places.*

- *Myths and traditional stories have stood the test of time because they contain important cultural and moral messages that are still relevant today.*

- *Modern authors use myths and traditional stories as a basis for stories because the cultural and moral messages have stood the test of time.*

How and why can we modernize myths and traditional stories to be meaningful to today’s audiences?

- *We can use the themes, patterns of events, and character types from myths and traditional stories as a basis for modern narratives set in the present day.*

What will your student be doing at school?

In Unit 2, students will continue to read *Summer of the Mariposas*. The first half of the unit will focus on theme in *Summer of the Mariposas*, with students analyzing how the theme has developed over the text and writing a summary. In the second half of the unit, students write a new scene for *Summer of the Mariposas* in which they modernize a different Latin American folklore monster as a replacement for one of the other monsters chosen by Guadalupe Garcia McCall. In order to do this, students research a monster from Latin American folklore to choose.

Working to become ethical people and working to become effective learners are the habits of character emphasized in this unit. These are the specific skills students will focus on:

- I show empathy. This means I understand and share or take into account the feelings, situation, or attitude of others.

- I behave with integrity. This means I am honest and do the right thing, even when it’s difficult, because it is the right thing to do.

- I show respect. This means I appreciate the abilities, qualities, and achievements of others and treat myself, others, and the environment with care.

- I show compassion. This means I notice when others are sad or upset and try to help them.

- I can persevere. This means I challenge myself. When something is difficult or demanding, I keep trying and ask for help if I need it.

- I can collaborate. This means I can work well with others to accomplish a task or goal.

- I can take responsibility. This means I take ownership of my ideas, my work, my goals, and my actions.

- I can take initiative. This means I see what needs to be done and take the lead on making responsible decisions.

How can you support your student at home?

Share traditional stories from your culture or heritage with your student. Ask your student about the lessons that these stories were meant to teach and how those messages might still be relevant today.

Talk to your student about how family and culture have influenced your life. Share examples of your family and culture and the specific impacts they have had.

Watch films and research on the internet with your student to find out more about Latin American myths and legends. The novel your student is studying references a number of different mythological figures. Build background knowledge on this topic by discovering together the details of the figures named in the novel.

Read chapter books with your student and discuss the point of view of characters within the book. How does the point of view differ from your own perspective? What effect does that have on you as a reader? Discuss the themes that are revealed in the books and how the author has introduced and developed these themes.

Unit 2: Homework

In all Unit 2 lessons, homework focuses on research reading and determining the meaning of unfamiliar words using context and reference materials. At the beginning of the unit, students also reread the chapter of *Summer of the Mariposas* that they have read in class and answer questions about it.

**Research reading:** When not reading the anchor text, your student is expected to independently research the topic by reading topic-related books of his or her choice for approximately 20 minutes <u>each day</u> and responding to a prompt of choice in the <u>front</u> of the independent reading journal. These are usually books your student will bring home from school; however, they may be topic-related books chosen by the student at the public or home library. Prompts for independent reading can be found in the homework materials provided.

**Choice reading:** If your student would also like to independently read and respond to a book of free choice, he or she may use the <u>back</u> of the independent reading journal. Prompts for independent reading can be found in the homework materials provided.

Vocabulary Logs

Students record new vocabulary in vocabulary logs and mark academic vocabulary with a symbol—for example, a star:

- **Academic vocabulary:** Words you might find in informational texts on many different topics. For example, the words *evidence* and *rationale* are words that could be found in books on any topic.

- **Domain-specific vocabulary:** Words about a particular topic. For example, the words *tadpoles*, *frogspawn*, and *amphibian* are some that would be found on the topic of frogs.

Independent Reading

Directions: Remember to record responses to research reading in the front of your independent reading journal and responses to choice reading in the back. Try to choose a different prompt each time. Record any new vocabulary in your vocabulary log. Underline vocabulary found during independent reading.

**Record:**

- Date

- Title and author of your reading book

- Pages you have read

- Prompt

- Response

**Example:**

<u>Date:</u> 10/13/2020

<u>Book Title and Author:</u> *Summer of the Mariposas* by Guadalupe Garcia McCall

<u>Pages Read:</u> 170–182

<u>Prompt:</u> What theme is present in the text you read? Give text details that convey that theme

<u>Response:</u> This chapter develops the theme that things are not always as they appear. This theme is developed when the sisters meet an injured donkey and Pita feels sorry for him and also believes that she can talk to him. Pita assures her sisters that the donkey is kind and will help them find shelter for the night. However, as they begin to travel the donkey begins to run, carrying the girls quickly across a field. He brings them to an ominous cave. Then, the donkey begins talking in a deep male voice and the sister know that something is wrong. He casts a spell on the girls and they fall asleep in his cave. This develops the theme that things are not always as they appear because the sister trust the lame little donkey only to find out he is a sorcerer.

**Consider using the following independent reading prompts.**[^1]

- How does this text add to your understanding of one of the guiding questions of the module?

- How does (character) change his/her point of view over the course of the plot?

- If you were (character), what would you do differently? How is your point of view different from that of the character?

- If the text contains a myth, what is the purpose of the myth?

- Which habits of character are demonstrated in the text? Explain.

- Record two or three facts in your own words that you learned from the text.

- Summarize your research reading today in no more than five sentences.

- What theme is present in the text you read? Give text details that convey that theme.

- What questions do you have about the topic after reading?

- Choose one new word from your reading today and analyze it on a vocabulary square.

| Definition in your own words                  | Synonyms (words with the same meaning) |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Words with the same affix or root             | Sketch                                 |
| Translation in home language (if appropriate) |                                        |

Vocabulary

Directions: In the classroom, you have been recording words from your texts in your vocabulary log. Throughout this unit, you have been research reading topic-related books at home to build your knowledge of mythology and recording words in your independent reading journal.

Choose a word from your research reading or from a text you’ve read in class and add the word to your vocabulary log. Try to choose a different word to add and to practice a different vocabulary strategy each time. For each word, be sure to add the following:

1.  The definition, or meaning, of the word

<!-- -->

8.  The vocabulary strategy you used to figure out the meaning of the word

9.  A sketch or diagram that helps you to better understand the meaning of the word

**Vocabulary Strategies**

As a reminder, the vocabulary strategies we’ve been working on in class are listed below:

- Context: Read the sentence around the word.

- Look at the affixes for clues.

- Look at the root of the word for clues.

- Use a dictionary.

- Discuss the word with another person (after attempting some of the above strategies).

[^1]: Some of the prompts will not be appropriate for the text students are reading. Invite students to choose a prompt that works for the text they have just read.
