English Language Learners: Grade 8: Module 1: Unit 2: Teaching Notes

Theme and Summary in *Summer of the Mariposas*: Narrative Writing

Teaching Notes for Unit 2

Prioritize Lessons for Classrooms with Many ELLs

In this unit, students will be carrying out two major writing tasks: a summary and a narrative. Both of these writing exercises will require careful preparation and scaffolding, and ELLs may find them particularly challenging. As a result, all lessons in this unit serve a vital purpose in getting students ready for both the mid-unit assessment and the end of unit assessment. Within each lesson, prioritize analysis of model summaries and narratives, planning for summaries and narratives using graphic organizers, and peer critique. While in-class reading time continues to be a vital portion of Work Time within each lesson, students will have hopefully grown in their ability to carry this out effectively, and as such, it may be possible to reduce time spent on this activity slightly, to create more opportunities for writing work, particularly if students are able to complete some reading independently outside of class as well. The Language Dive in Lesson 1 should also be prioritized, as it is a rich opportunity for ELLs to think deeply about the relationship between language structure and theme; insights gained during the Language Dive will prove useful as students plan and write summaries of the text’s themes in Lessons 2 and 3 and during the mid-unit assessment in Lessons 4 and 5.

Language Dives

Students participate in one Language Dive in this unit, in Lesson 1, focused on a theme from the novel *Summer of the Mariposas* to address RL.8.2 and to build understanding that targets the module guiding question, ”How can we can use the themes, patterns of events, and character types from myths and traditional stories as a basis for modern narratives set in the present day?” This Language Dive also explores how pronouns and conditional mood are used to create meaning. A Language Dive empowers students to analyze, understand, and use the language of academic sentences, which can often seem opaque to students. During a Language Dive, slow down for 10–20 minutes to examine the meaning, purpose, and structure of a compelling sentence from a complex text, model, learning target, checklist, or rubric included in the curriculum. This process invites students to unpack complex syntax, or “academic phrases,” as a way to build both literacy and habits of mind. Students then apply their understanding of language structure as they work toward the assessments and performance task. Through the Language Dive’s engaging Deconstruct-Reconstruct-Practice routine, students play with “chunks” of the sentence, interpreting them, rearranging them, and using them to talk about their own lives or lesson content. As a result of paying close attention to how language works, all students begin to acquire the necessary facility with academic English, and ELLs foster their overall language ability. A consistent Language Dive routine is critical in helping all students learn how to decipher complex sentences and write their own.

Most Language Dives implicitly address a wide range of Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening, and Language standards. Once comfortable with Language Dives, consider supplementing the focus standards in a particular Language Dive with additional standards to meet their students’ needs. Note that the Rationale section of each Language Dive also identifies supporting standards that are explicitly addressed but are not the main focus of the Language Dive.

Note: Some responses to questions in the Language Dive indicate only that “Responses will vary.” Like one the larger goals of Language Dives, “Responses will vary” is intended to suggest that students should be encouraged to grapple with questions and ideas, develop interest and participation, and not be immediately steered toward “correct” responses. Indeed, even where correct responses are provided, continue to invite a culture of inquiry and grappling.

Diversity and Inclusion

Investigate the routines, practices, rituals, beliefs, norms, and experiences that are important to ELLs and their families. Integrate this background into the classroom as students explore the class novel, *Summer of the Mariposas*. As in Unit 1, much of the work that students will carry out during this unit is centered around this text, which tells the story of a group of five Mexican-American sisters who set out on a sometimes challenging, but magical, journey. Invite students to share any connections they may have made with the text to honor those whose own backgrounds may be similar to that of the characters. Hispanic students may have some familiarity with the modernized versions of popular stories from Latin American folklore woven throughout the story, like La Llorona, chupacabras, and the lechuzas. Be mindful of potential fear, hesitation, or distress among students in discussing the topic of border crossing. Foster inclusive action by creating space for students to express their feelings about sensitive issues embedded in the novel, knowing that these discussions may help create equity or unearth trauma, or both. Create a supportive and inclusive classroom environment by reminding students that everyone is working toward improvement. Be sure to highlight and praise growth and development rather than relative performance. Use as a topic or text warmer or reflection with the entire class: a check-in at any strategic point during the unit to continually connect students’ personal experience to the topic or text and to share how each one has changed and grown in association with the other. Consult with a guidance counselor, school social worker, or ESL teacher for further investigation of diversity and inclusion.

Conversation Cues

Encourage productive and equitable conversation with Conversation Cues, which are questions to ask students that help achieve four goals:

- (Goal 1) encourage all students to talk and be understood;

- (Goal 2) listen carefully to one another and seek to understand;

- (Goal 3) deepen thinking; and

- (Goal 4) think with others to expand the conversation (adapted from Michaels, Sarah and O’Connor, Cathy. *Talk Science Primer*. Cambridge, MA: TERC, 2012. http://inquiryproject.terc.edu/shared/pd/TalkScience_Primer.pdf. Based on Chapin, S., O’Connor, C., and Anderson, N. \[2009\]. *Classroom Discussions: Using Math Talk to Help Students Learn, Grades K–6*. Second Edition. Sausalito, CA: Math Solutions Publications).

Refer to the Tools Page (http://eled.org/tools) for the complete set of cues. Goal 1 Conversation Cues are introduced in Unit 1, Lesson 1 and suggestions for integrating Conversation Cues into instruction are presented across lessons. For ELLs, Conversation Cues are especially critical because they improve language processing abilities and increase engagement and participation.

Strategic Grouping

Students work in pairs and small groups during text-based discussions, Language Dives, and other tasks. For Language Dives and other work that focus on language, match ELLs with a partner who has greater language proficiency. For text-based discussions that focus on gist, point of view, characters, theme, and main ideas, pair ELLs with students who share the same home language to allow for rich discussion around ideas. The conversations that happen as a result of such strategic pairing will greatly serve the language development of both partners. As in Unit 1, use strategic grouping during in-class reading time for read-alouds. Strategic grouping will be especially important during Lessons 7–10 as students research and plan their narrative. For this work, it is recommended that ELLs work closely with strong, proficient English language users, particularly in analyzing the model narrative and carrying out research.

Write Summaries

Help ELLs to understand the difference between objective reporting of key events in summaries and one’s own subjective analysis of theme through analysis and annotation of model summaries and peer critique. Provide ELLs with essential language that can be applied in their writing, including transition words, which can help students when sharing details about plot and events. Temporal words like *when*, *as*, *while*, *then*, *next*, *finally*, *before*, *after*, *since*, *from*, *first*, *second*, *lastly*, and *during* are examples of linking words that will help students to connect events while writing both summaries and narratives. In general, students may find it helpful to engage in discussion before writing; for example, allow students time to talk through the main ideas and themes of a chapter orally within pairs or groups before recording this in writing.

Write Narrative Essays

A model-based approach to learning how to write a narrative essay ensures access to effective writing instruction for students with a wide variety of language backgrounds and experience with writing in English. Work with a model essay across a series of lessons enables students to plan their essays over the course of the unit and then write their essays during the end of unit assessment. Having the opportunity to gradually plan their final essays with explicit instructions on how to do so supports ELLs by making each step of the process of essay writing, and the academic language associated with it, transparent and comprehensible. Encourage ELLs to break down the planning and writing of the narrative writing task into manageable chunks, as the volume of writing required for this task may be intimidating. Allow students to sketch and act out key events in their narratives during planning to bring ideas to life.

Text-Based Discussions

Break down content, share-outs, or tasks into two parts for ELLs: cognitive and linguistic. First, invite home language use to allow students to more comfortably process their ideas. This will allow students to first focus on the cognitive demands necessary to complete particularly demanding content, share-outs, or tasks. In addition, inviting home language use helps students build academic mindsets. After they have met the cognitive demands in their home language, they can be invited to discuss the task in classroom English, a language they are still learning. ELLs may require extra support in preparation for the End of Unit 2 Assessment, in which students will apply knowledge and strategies connected to listening, speaking, and reading skills areas.

Celebration

Celebrate the courage, enthusiasm, diversity, and bilingual assets that ELLs bring to the classroom. Additionally, students can celebrate their successful attempts at communication, focusing on progress, rather than perfection.
