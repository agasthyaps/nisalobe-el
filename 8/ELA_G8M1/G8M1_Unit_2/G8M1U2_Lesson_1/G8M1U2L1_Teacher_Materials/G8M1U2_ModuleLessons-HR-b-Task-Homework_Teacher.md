In chapter 13 of *Summer of the Mariposas*, the five sisters encounter the lechuzas, a coven of demonic owls, but are able to defeat them. After leaving the nagual’s cave, Odilia explains to her sisters that they have been under the protection of La Llorona and Tonantzin. The girls remember Teresita’s warning about the lechuzas and look for a place to hide for the night. The girls find an old barn, but the owl demons find them there. The lechuzas attack and hurl insults at the girls and tell them they are evil and selfish. When Velia and Delia run out of the barn, Odilia thinks they will be defeated, but the twins return with weapons and the girls stand in a circle to fight off and eventually defeat the lechuzas. On page 207, Odilia repeats, “We stood side by side” as she describes how the sisters defeated the lechuzas, emphasizing the theme being kind and pure of heart can help people live fuller, more meaningful lives.

| In chapter 12 of *Summer of the Mariposas*, the five girls are captured by the *nagual* but Tonantzin comes to rescue them and defeat the nagual. When Odilia awakes in the cave, she and her sisters are tied up and the nagual has changed from his donkey form to his warlock form. The nagual is making a potion in a cauldron that will kill the sisters. It will also release the warlock from his curse and allow him to become more powerful. Odilia remembers Teresita’s advice to sing the song of the cave but she can’t remember it. She spins her earring pendant and calls on Tonantzin. She is then able to wake up her sisters and remember the song of the cave that their mother sang to them. The sisters sing the song together, and the dead butterflies in the cave come to life and create the form of Tonantzin. She causes the nagual to fall into his own potion, which allows the sisters to escape the cave. On page 190, Odilia says that Tonantzin “looked like an Aztec goddess, but her face was that of a Mexican girl, the face of our many friends and cousins, a teenager, like us.” This continues to develop the theme “family and culture shapes our identity.” |
