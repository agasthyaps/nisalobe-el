(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

“If **we do that,** everything will be all right.” (from page 194 of *Summer of the Mariposas* by Guadalupe Garcia McCall)

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: This sentence helps to address the daily learning target and RL.8.2 by adding to students’ understanding of theme in *Summer of the Mariposas*, and L.8.3a, and L.8.4a by providing opportunities to explore how pronouns and the conditional mood function in English.

- Supporting Standards: SL.8.1.

- Guiding Question: The sentence helps respond to the guiding question by focusing students’ attention on theme within a modern narrative that incorporates myths and traditional stories into a present-day setting.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses the conditional mood with the purpose of expressing cause and effect. Invite students to discuss each chunk briefly, but encourage extended conversation and practice with the focus structure: **we do that**.

- Practice and Transfer: After discussing the focus structure, students practice using it to discuss something in their lives. Students transfer their understanding of the meaning and structure of this sentence when analyzing theme in *Summer of the Mariposas*, and when using conditional mood and pronouns in their own writing and speaking.

- Delivery: Note that the sentence is first presented with the sentence that comes before it in the text. The purpose of this is to help students understand context as is relates to theme.

**Time**

10 minutes

Throughout the Language Dive

Consider focusing student attention on subjects and verbs within each clause using colored markers (subject: blue; verb: red).

Encourage rich conversation among students about the meaning of each of the sentence chunk strip, what the academic phrases within each chunk mean, and how they relate to the sentence and the text overall. Monitor and guide conversation with total participation techniques and Conversation Cues.

After asking questions, provide students up to 1 minute of think time to reflect, depending on the complexity of the question. Alternatively, invite partners to discuss, providing an allocated time for each student.

Record and display student responses next to or underneath the target language for visual reference.

Although students should briefly discuss all chunks in each Language Dive sentence, invite them to slow down during one chunk, called the focus structure, to investigate and practice a particularly compelling language structure.

Where possible, consider placing sketches, pictures, or illustrations above key nouns and verbs in the chunks after discussing their meanings. This allows students to quickly access the content of each chunk as they work with the structures in the sentence as a whole.

For translation work, invite students to use their online or paper translation dictionary if necessary. Invite students to add new vocabulary to their vocabulary logs.

Note: Some responses to questions in the Language Dive indicate only that “Responses will vary.” Like one the larger goals of Language Dives, “Responses will vary” is intended to suggest that students should be encouraged to grapple with questions and ideas, develop interest and participation, and not be immediately steered toward “correct” responses. Indeed, even where correct responses are provided, consider continuing to invite a culture of inquiry and grappling.

**Key**

Red

Blue

Launch

- Welcome students to their third Grade 8 Language Dive. Display the term **Language Dive**.

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partner. Say:

“Based on your second Language Dive, what do you think a Language Dive is?” (Responses will vary.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- If productive, cue students to clarify the conversation by confirming what they mean. If necessary, prompt students’ responses with sentence frames: “Yes, you’ve got it” or “No, sorry, that’s not what I mean. What I mean is \_\_\_\_\_.” Say:

“So, do you mean \_\_\_\_\_?” (Responses will vary.)

- Confirm or amend and display students’ ideas.

Deconstruct

- Remind students about the first step in the Deconstruct stage:

“When we do a Language Dive, first we read the sentence. We talk about what we think it means and how it might help us understand our guiding question.”

- Invite students to put their finger by these sentences from *Summer of the Mariposas* on their note-catcher: “La Llorona said we have to remain noble and kind. **If <u>we do that</u>, everything will be all right.”**

- Read aloud the sentences twice, and then ask students to take turns reading the sentences aloud with their partners.

- Say:

“What do these sentences mean to you?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“How do these sentences add to your understanding of the theme: being kind and pure of heart can help people live fuller, more meaningful lives?” (Responses will vary.)

- Say:

“In this Language Dive, we are going to look at the second sentence, ‘If we do that, everything will be all right,’ but you will need to think about the meaning of the first sentence, ‘La Llorona said we have to remain noble and kind, to help you understand the second one.”

- Read aloud the sentence, together, twice: “If **we do that**, everything will be all right.”

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

“If

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following sentence chunk strip: **“If**

- Remind students that saying something in their own words can help them figure out the meaning of sentences and chunks.

- Say:

“What’s another way to say if?” (Students may have trouble explaining this meaning in isolation, but look for responses like “possible something will happen,” “maybe,” or “because.”)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- Say:

“Let’s talk about the second chunk.”

we do that,

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **we do that,**

- Underline we in blue marker and do in red marker, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 🖉

- Say:

“What does this chunk tell us?” (This chunk tells us a group of people is doing something. Because it includes the word we, the person speaking is part of this group.)

“What does do that mean in this chunk?” (Students will likely respond with “something.” Or may even say, “I don’t know.” In this sentence, that is referring to “remain noble and kind” in the previous sentence.)

- Say:

“So how can we figure out the meaning of that? Well, we know that can be a pronoun, which means it is replacing a word or phrase that came before it. In this sentence, that is combined with do; do that is replacing a verb phrase. We need to figure out which verb phrase do that is replacing. To determine this, we need to look back at information that we already have from a previous clause or sentence.”

- Say:

“How can we figure out the meaning of do that?” (Since there is no other clause before this one in the sentence, we must look at the sentence that came before this one: “La Llorona said we have to remain noble and kind.”)

- Invite students to put their finger by these sentences from *Summer of the Mariposas* on their note-catcher: **La Llorona said we have to remain noble and kind. If <u>we do that</u>, everything will be all right.**

- Read aloud the sentences, together, twice, again.

- Say:

“So now what do you think do that means in this chunk?” (It means remain noble and kind.)

- Cue students by saying:

“I’ll give you time to discuss this with a partner.”

- After inviting responses, write and display student ideas.

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Tell students they will now practice the focus structure:

“You’ve played with this chunk and figured out the meaning. Now let’s use the structure in the sentence for our own speaking and writing to explore how that can be used as a pronoun.”

- Display the sentence frame:

> **People say we have to be kind and pure of heart. If we \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, our lives will be fuller and more meaningful.**
>
> (If + we + do that = dependent clause)

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Let’s use this frame to talk about the theme, being kind and pure of heart can help people live fuller, more meaningful lives.” 🖉

- After inviting responses, write and display student ideas.

- Say:

“Let’s talk about the final chunk.”

everything will be all right.”

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **everything will be all right.”**

- Underline everything in blue marker and will be in red marker and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 🖉

- Say:

“What does this chunk tell us?” (This chunk tells us that things will work out and have a positive result or effect.)

“What does the helping verb will tell us about time?” (This verb tells us that this clause is talking about the future.)

“What does the phrase all right tell us?” (This phrase tells us specifically how things will be. It means that all is well and that any problems or dangers from the past have been resolved.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

“If we do that, everything will be all right.”

Reconstruct

- Say:

“You did well figuring out what all of the chunks mean, and why they’re important.”

- Remind students they will now go from the Deconstruct to the Reconstruct stage:

“Now that you’ve played with the chunks, let’s put them all back together again into a sentence. And let’s see how playing with the chunks adds to our understanding of the meaning of the sentence and our guiding question. Let’s see how reconstructing helps us understand how English works.”

- Point to and read the entire sentence on display: **“If <u>we do that</u>, everything will be all right.”**

- Ask students to look at the words underlined in blue and red.

- Say:

“What do you notice about the words underlined in blue?” (The words underlined in blue are subjects.)

“What do you notice about the words underlined in red?” (The words underlined in red are verbs.)

“A sentence only has to have one subject and verb phrase, but this sentence has two subjects and two verbs, which means it has two clauses.”

- Say:

“The first clause starts with if, which we said means something like possibly. The second clause has the verb will, so it’s talking about the future. If and will give us information about the relationship between the events in the clauses. What do they tell us?” (They express cause and effect. The result in the second clause depends on the action in the first one. This construction of if/will is the conditional mood.)

- After inviting responses, discuss student ideas. If students need additional support in determining the relationship between the clauses, offer choices to guide their thinking.

- Say:

“Does this sentence tell us about two things happening at the same time or one thing happening later because another one has happened? How do you know” (The second event happens later, in the future. We know this because of the word will.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- Say:

“What other questions can we ask that will help us understand this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses will vary.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

Practice

- Say:

“You did well putting the chunks back together again and talking about how this Language Dive has added your understanding of the meaning of the sentence and the guiding question.”

- Remind students they will now go from the Reconstruct to the Practice stage:

“You’ve played with the sentence and figured out the meaning, and why it’s important to the guiding question. Now let’s start to use the language in the sentence for our own speaking and writing.”

- Display the sentence frames:

> **If I \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, I will be happy.**
>
> (**If** clause + clause with **will** = conditional)
>
> **If I don’t eat breakfast, I will be \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**
>
> (**If** clause + clause with **will** = conditional)

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use this frame to talk about how your actions can affect how you feel in your own words with your partners.”

- If productive, cue students to clarify their sentences by confirming what they mean:

“So, do you mean \_\_\_\_\_?” (Responses will vary. Ensure that students are using the structure meaningfully.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- Congratulate students on completing the Language Dive to better understand the meaning of this sentence, how it connects to the guiding question, and how to use it in their own speaking and writing.
