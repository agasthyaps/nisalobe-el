Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 8

RL.8.4, L.8.4a

(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, answer the following questions.

Read the following sentence:

- “As we wandered along the shallow shore, the mist **dissipated**, exposing an entire community of canoes being steered by both men and women on the surface of the lake” (277).

From the context, what do you think **dissipated** means? Explain your thinking.

Student responses will vary, but may include how it is difficult to see through mist and how something happens that exposes “an entire community of canoes.” If something is exposed, it was not seen before, which means the mist must have disappeared in order to expose the canoes.

What word could you replace it with to have a similar meaning?

vanished
