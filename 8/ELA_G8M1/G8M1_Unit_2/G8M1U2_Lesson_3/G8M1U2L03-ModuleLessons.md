Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RL.8.2 – Work Time B: Students will determine the theme(s) of a chapter in *Summer of the Mariposas* and analyzing the development of the theme(s) over the course of the chapter.

- RL.8.1 – Work Time B: Students will identify strong evidence that supports their analysis of the development of theme.

- RL.8.2 – Work Time C: Students will write a summary of *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 15, including a theme statement.

- RL.8.1 – Work Time C: Students will use details and evidence to support their summary writing.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- You may choose to have students go back to previous chapters of the book and to analyze how previously identified themes were developed throughout the earlier chapters of the story. You might also invite students to begin to write summaries of previous chapters or sections of the book for extended practice.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students analyzed the development of theme in chapter 14 by filling out a note-catcher and then wrote a summary paragraph for chapter 14. Today, students will continue to use their note-catcher to track a prominent theme in chapter 15 and will continue to practice their summary paragraph skills.

Support All Students

- Students may need additional support with writing a summary. Place those who will need additional support in one group to receive support.

- Students may need additional support understanding the importance of source attribution and writing “in your own words.” Cultural differences may come up here. In some cases, it could be important to help parents understand these conventions, too. ▲

- Note that there is a Synopsis: *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 15 ▲ in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. This resource should only be used as necessary for students who need support. ▲

- Chapter 15 again brings up the potentially sensitive topic of abandonment as the girls’ grandmother tells them of their father’s selfishness and his plan to divorce their mother. As this may be an emotional topic for some students, monitor students and determine whether issues are surfacing that need to be discussed in more detail as a whole group, in smaller groups, or independently. Consider reaching out to families if a particular topic is sensitive for a student.

- To support ELLs, this lesson continues work with theme development in *Summer of the Mariposas* and provides further practice with summary writing.

- ELLs may find it challenging to connect themes with examples from the novel, as well as to apply their knowledge of summary writing to actual practice. As in Lesson 2, in both Work Time A and Work Time B, select supports that reduce the cognitive load of tasks by breaking down and simplifying productive (writing) language tasks so that students can focus on the concepts of theme and summary.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.A.1, 8.I.A.3, 8.I.A.4, 8.I.B.6, 8.I.B.7, 8.I.B.8, 8.I.C.10, 8.I.C.12, and 8.II.A.1.

Assessment Guidance

- Review student summaries and theme note-catchers during and after the lesson to check whether they are on the right track. Use common issues as teaching points for the whole group in the next lesson. Teachers may also offer written feedback. Students will review their feedback in Lesson 4 before they begin their mid-unit assessment.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will conduct a whole class critique of one student’s summary and take their mid-unit assessment, which will assess their ability to analyze the development of theme and to write objective summaries about chapter 16 in *Summer of the Mariposas*.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RL.8.4 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 3**.

- Once all students are ready, invite students to share a suggested meaning for the word *jostle* (bump into). Turn and Talk about the following questions:

“How did you come up with that definition?”

“What clues did the context give you?” (Student responses will vary, but may include how the sentence states that the girls were exhilarated, which means they were excited to finally reach grandma’s house, so they “walked hurriedly.” As they are moving quickly, they are being careful not to “jostle” Pita because she’s in the stretcher. Since Pita is hurt, it makes sense that they are being careful not move too quickly and bump into or knock into her.)

“What words could you replace it with to have a similar meaning?” (Push.)

- Invite a student to guide the class through checking the definition in a dictionary, and invite a student to add the word and definition to the **academic word wall**, with translations in home languages where appropriate (bump into).

- Add any relevant notes to the vocabulary strategies on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart.**

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

- To help students absorb the meaning of the word *jostle*, invite students to act out the events in the sentence in which the word is found. This will also reinforce that acting out the meaning of vocabulary can help with understanding and retaining meaning.

For Heavier Support

- Provide students with additional practice using context clues to determine the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary. Invite students to generate a list of strategies that they can use to do so (e.g., *reading the sentences that come before and after the sentence that contains the word; looking for synonyms and definitions in the sentence; considering adjectives and adverbs that describe a verb*).

Work Time

A. Read *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 15 Excerpt (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same process as with previous lessons for students to read the excerpt of chapter 15 of ***Summer of the Mariposas***, using the **Text Guide: *Summer of the Mariposas*** **(for teacher reference)**. Instruct students to read the excerpt independently, and support struggling students as needed. Then have students identify the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary, add words to the **chart paper of Spanish words**, reflect on their reading as they choose, and record the gist on **sticky notes** using the following resources as appropriate: **vocabulary logs** and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- For ELLs and students who require additional support, **Synopsis:** ***Summer of the Mariposas***, **Chapter 15** ▲ can be used to review the key details from the chapter.

- Gist: Abuelita heals Pita after chupacabra attacks her and the girls learn about their father.

- Asks students to Think-Pair-Share about the following questions related to becoming ethical people. (Refer to the Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart as needed.):

“In what ways are the sisters growing in their ability to show compassion or empathy to others?” (Student answers will vary, but could be along the lines of the following: The girls are more respectful to one another when having difficult discussion with Abuelita. As they learn more about their father from Abuelita, they are compassionate and listen to one another, honoring each other’s feelings.)

“What other examples of compassion or empathy are you seeing as the plot unfolds?” (Student answers will vary, but could be along the lines of the following: The girls start to consider their mother’s feelings and show empathy as they realized she was also abandoned by their father. Even though they have felt neglected by Mama in the past year, they can see that she was going through a difficult time. Abuelita shows compassion when she talks directly and honestly to her granddaughters about the faults of their father and they ways his actions have hurt and impacted the family.)

Work Time

B. Analyze Development of Theme: *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 15 – RL.8.2 (10 minutes)

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share about themes by asking the following questions.

“What is the definition of ***theme***?”

“What themes are we beginning to see in *Summer of the Mariposas*?”

- Remind students that the themes of a text are the messages or main ideas relevant to the real world that the author wants the reader to take away from reading a literary text. Remind students that a text may have many themes, and we often see multiple themes emerge that are not fully developed until the end of the story. Remind students that we want to look for the most prominent, recurring themes as we track their development throughout the story.

- Invite students to take out their **Develop Theme: *Summer of the Mariposas*** **note-catchers**. Read aloud the quote in row 3, column 1.

- Direct students to fill out the third row on their Develop Theme: *Summer of the Mariposas* note-catchers.

- Use **equity sticks** to invite students to share their answers and invite students to add to their note-catchers when they hear new ideas. See **Develop Theme: *Summer of the Mariposas*** **note-catcher (for teacher reference)**.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time B, continue use of the same supports used in Lesson 2 for completing the Develop Theme: *Summer of the Mariposas* note-catcher. Students can add the remaining strips of paper with prewritten examples from column 4 to row 3 and consider their meaning once they have determined the theme in column 2, before finally completing column 3 with their own writing. Continuing to approach the task in this sequence will help guide students’ thinking about theme while reducing potential for writing proficiency to limit or delay this conceptual process.

Work Time

C. Write a Summary: *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 15 – RL.8.2 (10 minutes)

- Review appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can write an objective summary of *Summer of the Mariposas*, chapter 15.”

- Display the **Criteria for an Effective Summary anchor chart**.

- Remind students to keep these criteria in mind as they write their summary paragraph.

- Remind students that summaries briefly give us the central idea(s) and key details of a text so we can determine whether we need to read it when looking for evidence to support thinking, discussion, or writing later on, and to help us quickly remember what the text is about when describing it to others.

- Tell students that they are now going to write a summary of *Summer of the Mariposas*, chapter 15. Give them 1 minute to think. Ask students to Turn and Talk. The first student to speak (partner A) will orally summarize the chapter. Refocus the whole group and have partners switch roles. The second person to speak (partner B) will do the same, adding or removing any relevant details. ▲

- Distribute **Objective Summary: Chapter 15 handout**. Invite students to write their summaries and remind them to use the Criteria for an Effective Summary anchor chart.

- Remind students that when writing paragraphs such as a summary, they should write in complete sentences.

- Circulate to support students as they write. Note any trends to highlight during the Closing and Assessment or next lesson.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time C, review criteria of an effective summary, including looking at short samples of both effective and ineffective summarizing as a review strategy, in preparation for the mid-unit assessment in Lessons 4 and 5.

For Heavier Support

N/A

Closing and Assessment

A. Reflect on Learning Targets (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets

- Incorporate reflection on and awareness of the following academic mindsets: “I can succeed at this” and “My ability and competence grow with my effort.”

- Ask students to Turn and Talk:

“What helped you to be successful at that task? How much effort did you put in on this task? How did your effort affect your learning?” (Possible responses: I was successful at that task because I focused and worked hard. I also worked and talked with my peers, which grew my learning.)

Homework

A. Answer Text-Dependent Questions and Revise a Summary Paragraph

- Using **Homework: Text-Dependent Questions and Summary Revisions: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Chapter 15**, students answer selected response questions about chapter 15 of *Summer of the Mariposas* and then revise their summary paragraphs to meet the criteria.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students should preread chapter 16 of *Summer of the Mariposas* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.
