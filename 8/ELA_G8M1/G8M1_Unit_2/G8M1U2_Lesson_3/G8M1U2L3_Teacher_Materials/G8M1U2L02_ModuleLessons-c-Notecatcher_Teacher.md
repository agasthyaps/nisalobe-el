<td>“La Llorona said we have to remain noble and kind. If we do that, everything will be all right.” page 194</td>
<td>Being kind and pure of heart can help people live fuller, more meaningful lives.</td>
<td>Odilia’s words develop the theme “being kind and pure of heart can help us live fuller, more meaningful and caring lives” because she is reminding herself and her sisters of the advice given by La Llorona that kindness and nobility will aid the sisters in their journey and help them discover what is most meaningful in their lives.</td>
<td><p><strong>When the sisters were not kind nor pure but were rude toward Cecilia, they were cursed and their journey became much more difficult—despite the pitfalls of others, the sisters will not survive their journey if they mirror that negativity.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When the sisters chose to be kind and return the dead man to his family, they were able to begin their transformative journey and La Llorona came to aid them.</strong></p></td>

<td>“‘Please,’ the <em>chupacabra</em> said between sobs. ‘Please don’t hurt me. I am Chencho, the boy who helped you. I am your friend.’” page 232</td>
<td><strong>Things are not always as they appear.</strong></td>
<td><strong>This detail develops the theme that things are not always as they appear, because at first Chencho appears to be only a shepherd boy until he is revealed to be the demonic <em>chupacabra</em>, only to show that he is, in fact, just a sad little boy who cannot help his beastly impulses. The girls develop a deeper, more compassionate understanding of Chencho as they discover his true identity.</strong></td>
<td><p><strong>At first, Odilia does not trust La Llorona, but she soon learns that La Llorona is a kind and motherly figure, not a demon.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The sisters think that the dead man was a wonderful father whose family will be happy to have his body returned, but they soon learn that he was estranged from his family and the return of his body causes grief.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The sisters trust Cecilia wholeheartedly only to discover that she is evil and wants to kill them.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Odilia does not trust the donkey when they find him, but her sisters do—until he transforms into the nagual.</strong></p></td>

<td>“Instead, I want you to continue taking care of each other the way you’ve been doing so far. I’m proud of you for standing up for your <em>hermanitas</em> against those evil creatures. I’m sure having to do that has taught you how important it is to stick together and love one another more than anything in the world.” page 257</td>
<td><strong>Being kind and pure of heart can help people live fuller, more meaningful lives.</strong></td>
<td><strong>Abuelita’s advice develops the theme “being kind and pure of heart can help people live fuller, more meaningful lives” because she expresses her pride in the sisters’ kindness and loyalty toward one another and asks them to continue to remain kind and caring toward one another as they return home. By now, the girls can understand this better than they could at the beginning of the story, since they have been through so much together.</strong></td>
<td><p><strong>(See examples above . . .)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Odilia repeatedly protects her sisters and comes to their rescue when they have made mistakes—because of this kindness and nobility, the sisters are able to overcome challenges together.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When the sisters stand together and support one another, they defeat the lechuzas.</strong></p></td>
