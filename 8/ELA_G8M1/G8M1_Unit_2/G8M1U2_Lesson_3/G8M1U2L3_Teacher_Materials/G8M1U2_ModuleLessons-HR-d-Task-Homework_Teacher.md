(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Reread chapter 15 of *Summer of the Mariposas,* and answer the questions below. Then, revise your summary paragraph of chapter 15 based on the class discussion and criteria.

1.  What is a theme evident in this excerpt of chapter 15 of *Summer of the Mariposas*? (RL.8.2)

Being kind and pure of heart can help people live fuller, more meaningful lives.

2.  How is this theme developed in this chapter? What relationship does the theme have to the characters, setting, and plot? (RL.8.1, RL.8.2)

This theme is developed through the words of wisdom from Abuelita because she expresses her pride in the sisters’ kindness and loyalty toward one another and asks them to continue to remain kind and caring toward one another as they return home. By now, the girls can understand this better than they could at the beginning of the story, since they have been through so much together.

3.  Where else in the book has the author developed this theme? Provide one example. (RL.8.1, RL.8.2)

Throughout the novel, the girls face demons and are able to overcome them when they stand together.

When the sisters were not kind nor pure, but were rude toward Cecilia, they were cursed, and their journey became much more difficult. Despite the pitfalls of others, the sisters will not survive their journey if they mirror that negativity.

When the sisters chose to be kind and return the dead man to his family, they were able to begin their transformative journey and La Llorona came to aid them.

Odilia repeatedly protects her sisters and comes to their rescue when they have made mistakes. Because of this kindness and nobility, the sisters are able to overcome challenges together.

When the sisters stand together and support one another, they defeat the lechuzas.

4.  Revise your summary of chapter 15 to meet the criteria below. (RL.8.2)

> **Be sure your summary includes the following elements:**

- an introduction to the text stating the title,

- the central idea of the chapter,

- a brief synthesis of the main events of the text, and

- a statement of theme (the point or message the author wants you to take away) evident in the chapter.

In chapter 15, the sisters finally find their abuelita and learn about their family. After Pita was bit by Chencho, the sisters are worried for her life. However, Abuelita recognizes the chupacabra bite and is able to provide the right herbs to slowly cure Pita. While Abuelita cares for the girls she tells them about how selfish and spoiled their father is, and she lets slip that he wants to divorce their mother, although she will not tell them exactly why he left them. The sisters worry for their mother and realize it is time to return home. On page 257, Abuelita says, “I’m so proud of you for standing up for your hermanitas against those evil creatures. I’m sure having to do that taught you how important it is to stick together and love one another more than anything else in the world.” This demonstrates the theme “being kind and pure of heart can help people live fuller, more meaningful lives.”
