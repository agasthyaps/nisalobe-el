In chapter 15 of *Summer of the Mariposas*, the sisters finally find their abuelita and learn about their family. After Pita was bitten by Chencho, the sisters are worried for her life. However, Abuelita recognizes the chupacabra bite and is able to provide the right herbs to slowly cure Pita. While Abuelita cares for the girls, she tells them about how selfish and spoiled their father is, and she lets slip that he wants to divorce their mother, although she will not tell them exactly why he left them. The sisters worry for their mother and realize it is time to return home. On page 257, Abuelita says, “I’m so proud of you for standing up for your hermanitas against those evil creatures. I’m sure having to do that taught you how important it is to stick together and love one another more than anything else in the world.” This demonstrates the theme “being kind and pure of heart can help people live fuller, more meaningful lives.”
