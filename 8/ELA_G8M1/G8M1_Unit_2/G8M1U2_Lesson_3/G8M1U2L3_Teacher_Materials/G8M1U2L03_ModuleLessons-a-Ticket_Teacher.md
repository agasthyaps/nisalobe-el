Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 3

RL.8.4, L.8.4a

(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, answer the following questions.

Read the following passage:

- “Exhilarated by the sight of our paternal grandmother’s home, we walked hurriedly down the hill toward the pink stucco building within the corral-like fence, being careful not to **jostle** Pita too much in the stretcher.” (240)

From the context, what do you think **jostle** means? Explain your thinking.

Student responses will vary but could be similar to the following: Since they were being careful, and since Pita is on a stretcher, the reader knows they are trying not to move Pita too much. So, *jostle* might mean move, bump into, or knock into.

What word could you replace it with to have a similar meaning?

Student answers will vary, but could be along the lines of push, bump, hit.
