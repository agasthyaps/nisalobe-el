End of Unit 2 Assessment: Write a Narrative

**Name:** **Date:**

Throughout the unit, you have been planning a new scene of *Summer of the Mariposas*. In this assessment, you will write the narrative you have been planning. In the scene you write, you will modernize a monster from the novel. Be sure that the scene that you write flows smoothly into the next scene of the novel.

REMEMBER: A well-written narrative

- introduces the characters and setting,

- organizes events in a logical sequence,

- slows down the pace during the most important events and speeds it up between important events,

- uses dialogue and description to slow down the pace,

- uses transitional words and phrases to move time along and speed up the pace,

- uses precise words and phrases and sensory language to convey experiences and events, and

- follows rules of writing (spelling, punctuation, and grammar).

Now, begin work on your narrative. Manage your time carefully so that you can

1.  draft your narrative and

2.  use the Narrative Writing Checklist to revise and edit your essay.
