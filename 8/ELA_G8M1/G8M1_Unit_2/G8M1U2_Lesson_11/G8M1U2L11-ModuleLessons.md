Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Work Time A: End of Unit Assessment – Writing a Narrative. Students will be assessed on their ability to develop and finalize the narrative that they have been preparing for and planning over the course of Lessons 6–10 of Module 1, Unit 2. Please note that students should type their narratives in a word processor so that they can later be copied and pasted to their website for the Performance Task. (RL.8.9, W.8.3, W.8.4, W.8.6, W.8.10)

- W.8.3 – Closing and Assessment A: Reflecting on learning using the Track Progress: Narrative Writing recording form. This exercise is meant to provide students time to formally keep track of and reflect on their own learning. This self-reflection supports metacognition, responsibility, and pride in work and learning.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Have students write an additional narrative independently to continue to practice the skills that have been scaffolded in this unit.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Throughout this unit, students have analyzed the development of narratives about Latin American monsters in *Summer of the Mariposas*. They have also analyzed a model narrative essay and have prepared to write their own by researching Latin American monsters, choosing a monster and creating a plan to modernize it. Students created a storyboard to plan their plot and setting and learned techniques for how to regulate pacing within their story. Today, students will utilize all of these skills when they write the narrative the have been planning.

Support All Students

- For some students, this assessment may require more than the 30 minutes allotted. Provide time over multiple days if necessary.

- Some students may need additional support using a word processor. Group these students together, and guide this group.

- Provide feedback on the mid-unit assessment that is directly relevant to the narrative writing students will do on the end of unit assessment. ELLs may find it particularly useful to be reminded of pervasive language errors that impede meaning and clarity. ▲

- To support ELLs, the end of unit assessment in this lesson directly connects to work in Lessons 6–10. Students will use their completed Storyboard graphic organizer to guide their work. Prior to beginning the assessment, during the Opening of the lesson, students will receive formal feedback on their mid-unit assessment. Some comments on the summary writing portion of the mid-unit assessment will aid ELLs as they take on the narrative writing task on the end of unit assessment by focusing their attention on their writing and how it can be improved.

- ELLs may find it challenging to apply their planning work to the assessment. In advance of the end of unit assessment, encourage ELLs to write a draft of their narrative outside of class as practice. If time allows, provide written or oral feedback to students on their work to aid them in their preparation for the assessment. End by congratulating students on their hard work during the unit, and invite them to celebrate both major and minor progress and improvements.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.C.10, 8.I.C.12, and 8.II.C.6.

Assessment Guidance

- Assessment materials (student copy, annotated student exemplar, teacher rubric) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback to students on this assessment, use the Narrative Writing Rubric (see Module 1 Teacher Guide: Appendix and/or Tools Page, https://eled.org/tools) and the annotated sample narrative to help complete the student Tracking Progress recording form. Make notes in the appropriate column for each criterion in a different color than student responses. There is also space provided to respond to student comments. Save a copy of the scored essays to use as a baseline assessment. These pieces can be used to measure the progress of individual students throughout the year, as well as to identify common instructional needs in a class.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will begin Unit 3 by closely reading the author’s note for *Summer of the Mariposas* and by revisiting student summaries and participating in a peer critique.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Return Mid-Unit 2 Assessments and Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students enter the classroom, invite students to complete **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 11** using their **Mid-Unit 2 Assessments with feedback** on their desks.

- Circulate as students review their feedback, and offer guidance and support as necessary.

- Once all students are ready, invite them to Turn and Talk, sharing their stars and steps with a partner. Remind students that everyone is working toward individual goals and that learning is about continued growth and development.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

Work Time

A. End of Unit 2 Assessment: Write a Narrative – W.8.3 (30 minutes)

- Invite students to retrieve the following materials:

- **Narrative Writing checklist**

- **Model Narrative: “Peuchen”**

- **Character and Setting planner**

- **Storyboard graphic organizer**

- Tell students that they will use their plans to write their narratives.

- Guide students to open up the **word processor** with which they will draft their narratives.

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence. Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart** and review perseverance and what this looks and sounds like. Remind students that as they will be writing their full narrative today, they may need to practice perseverance.

- Remind students that they planned this essay in the previous lessons.

- Invite students to begin the assessment.

- While students are taking the assessment, circulate to monitor and document their narrative writing skills.

- Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target, using a checking for understanding technique—for example, thumbs-up or traffic light signal cards. Scan student responses and make a note of students who might need support. Check in with them moving forward.

- Repeat, inviting students to self-assess how well they persevered in this lesson.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- Engage the class in a clarifying discussion about the assessment directions; ask one or more students to summarize the process they will use to carry out the narrative writing task. Record the process on the board for students to reference throughout the assessment, as needed.

Closing and Assessment

A. Track Progress — W.8.3 (10 minutes)

- Give students specific positive feedback on their completion of the End of Unit 2 Assessment. (Example: “I was pleased to see a lot of you referring back to your texts to find details.”)

- Distribute the **Track Progress: Narrative Writing, Track Progress folders**, and **sticky notes**. Tell students that successful learners keep track of and reflect on their own learning and that they will be completing a form like this after most of their assessments. Tell students that this helps to build responsibility for our work and learning. Select volunteers to read aloud each criterion for the whole group. After hearing each one read aloud, invite students to Turn and Talk with an elbow partner:

“What does that criterion mean in your own words?” (Responses will vary.)

- Read the directions aloud for students, and answer clarifying questions. Explain the scale and what each number represents. They should give themselves a 3 if they think they have achieved that criterion in their reading of new texts, a 4 if they think they have done even more than the criterion asks, a 2 if they think they are nearly there but not quite, and a 1 if they think they still have a lot of work to do.

- Distribute sticky notes. Tell students the sticky notes are for them to find evidence in their assessment work of the following criteria:

- W.8.3

- Guide students through completing Question 1 of the Tracking Progress form. If this is the first time students have completed this form, they may not be able to answer this question. In this situation, tell students to leave it blank and explain that next time they fill out the same form, they should be able to answer this question. If students completed these forms in previous grades, they will be able to look back to their Grade 7 forms.

- Point out the “Teacher Response” part under Question 2 and tell students that after class, you will read each student’s reflection and respond with feedback about their progress toward the skill.

- Direct students’ attention to Question 3 on the form, and select a volunteer to read it aloud for the group:

“How can I improve next time?”

- Invite students to Turn and Talk, reflecting with a partner on how they can improve on this skill in the future. Select volunteers to share with the group. Invite students to record their thinking in the appropriate spot on the Track Progress form.

- Have students place the form in their Track Progress folders, and collect students’ folders.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- As with earlier assessments in Units 1 and 2, in Closing and Assessment A, if students seem unsure of how to respond to the open-ended questions, provide examples of statements that answer the questions about previous improvements and goals for future improvement that are directly connected to the criteria within the Track Progress: Narrative Writing handout to help students create clear self-reflection and concrete, attainable personal targets (e.g., *“I have improved at using transitional words and phrases to show the relationships among experiences and events,” “In the future, I will improve my writing by using spelling, capitalization, and punctuation that are correct”*).

For Heavier Support
