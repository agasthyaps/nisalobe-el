**The Peuchen**

The peuchen is a shape-shifting creature in the Mapuche and Chilote mythology of southern Chile. It can assume the shape of any animal, but often appears as a huge flying snake with bat-like wings that paralyzes its victims through hypnosis so that it can drain the victim’s blood. The only person that can defeat the creature is a machi—a medicine woman. It has been linked to the Chupacabra.
