(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Researchers do these things:**

1.  Ask questions about a topic to focus their research

- Not too narrow nor too broad

- Specific to this topic

- Significant: important not only to you, but to others

- Can be answered using sources (i.e., not philosophical questions)

2.  Refine the questions into smaller, easier to research questions

3.  Use search terms or keywords in a search engine (Google, Yahoo, etc.) to find sources to answer the questions

4.  Evaluate the relevance and credibility of the sources on the results page by identifying the *publisher*, *author*, *bias*, *accuracy*, and *timeliness* of the source (See Choose and Use Reliable Internet Sources in the Researcher’s Toolbox.)

5.  Skim and scan each relevant and credible source to check that the source is truly relevant (will help answer questions)

6.  Read relevant parts of sources carefully, taking notes (paraphrasing, quoting accurately, summarizing, and citing the source—see step 7)

7.  Review their notes to see if they need to return to any of the steps above

8.  Analyze data and facts, and draw a conclusion

9.  Think about how new ideas or learning connect to what they already know

10. Talk with others to clarify their thinking and deepen their learning about a topic

11. Present what they have learned in their research through speaking or writing about the topic

12. Cite their sources:

- Author name Last, First. Title of text. *Publisher*, Date of publication, Pages.

- Author name Last, First M. “Article Title.” Website Title. *Website Publisher*, Date Month Year Published. Web. Date Month Year Accessed.
