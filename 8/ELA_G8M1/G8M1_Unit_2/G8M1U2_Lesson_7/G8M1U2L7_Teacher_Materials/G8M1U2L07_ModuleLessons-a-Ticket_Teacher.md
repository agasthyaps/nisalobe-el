(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, answer the following question.

When researching to find out more about monsters in folklore of Latin America, which of the following do you think would be the most effective search terms?

1.  Folklore Latin America

(This doesn’t contain *monster*—we are looking for information about monsters.)

2.  Monster folklore

(This doesn’t include *Latin America* and therefore could bring up monsters in any folklore.)

3.  <u>Monster folklore Latin America</u>

(Correct. This contains all of the necessary search terms.)

4.  Monsters in folklore of Latin America

(This one will work but has lots of unnecessary words.)
