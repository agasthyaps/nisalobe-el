Throughout Unit 2, you wrote and revised a new scene for *Summer of the Mariposas* in which you modernized a different monster from Latin American folklore. Throughout Unit 3, you wrote an informational essay comparing and contrasting your modernization of your monster with the original folklore. Now you are going to organize your narrative and your essay on a webpage with an explanation of how and why your chosen monster was modernized in your narrative. This webpage will then be organized on a class website about Folklore of Latin America.

Your webpage will include

- your new scene for *Summer of the Mariposas,*

- a comparison of your modernized monster with the original, and

- any relevant media (for example, images) you would like to include.
