11. **Part A**

A theme in this chapter is **Things are not always as they appear**. What has happened in earlier chapters of the book to develop the theme **Things are not always as they appear**? Provide one example (RL.8.1, RL.8.2)

Sample student responses:

The donkey was not a donkey at all—it was the nagual.

The boy wasn’t a boy, he was the chupacabras, but he was still a nice person.

**Part B**

How is this theme conveyed in chapter 16? How does this develop or build on the theme in this chapter compared to previous chapters? (RL.8.1, RL.8.2)

(Tip: Think about what other characters say and do and what happens to teach what Odilia and her sisters learn.)

Sample student response: Tonantzin tries to help the girls understand that things with their dad and their family are not what they might appear. She explains that things will become clearer later. This develops the theme because it moves the theme from the magical world into their own real-life world. A lot of the things in the book so far have been magical things that haven’t been what they appear, now Tonantzin is telling them that real-life things might not be as they appear.

12. Write an objective summary of this chapter.

Sample student response: In Chapter 16 of *Summer of the Mariposas*, the five girls return to the border of the United States and Mexico with their grandmother, Abuelita Remedios, to reunite with their mother. At the border they realize they don’t have the paperwork they need to cross over, so they go into a church and use the final spin of the magic earrings from La Llorona to ask for help. The goddess Tonantzin helps them to get home. Tonantzin tries to help the girls understand that things with their dad and their family are not what they might appear. She explains that things will become clearer later. On page 273, she says to the girls, “I know you don’t understand what is happening with your family . . . But you will, when the time comes,” which continues to develop the theme “things aren’t always as they appear.”
