Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RL8.2 – Work Time B: Students will determine the theme(s) of a chapter in *Summer of the Mariposas* and analyze the development of the theme(s) over the course of the chapter.

- RL.8.1 – Work Time B: Students will identify strong evidence that supports their analysis of the development of theme.

- RL.8.2 – Work Time C: Students will write an objective literary summary with a theme statement for a chapter in *Summer of the Mariposas*.

- RL.8.1 – Work Time C: Students will choose details and evidence to support their summary writing.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Have students go back to previous chapters of the book and to analyze how previously identified themes were developed throughout the earlier chapters of the story. Invite students to begin to write summaries of previous chapters or sections of the book for extended practice.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students analyzed a model summary with a theme statement and attempted their own for their homework assignment. In this lesson, students build upon these skills by tracking the development of theme in chapter 14 of *Summer of the Mariposas* and writing an objective summary of the chapter.

Support All Students

- Note there is a differentiated version of the Development of Theme: *Summer of the Mariposas* note-catcher used in Work Time B in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Students may need additional support with writing a summary. Place those who will need additional support in one group to receive support.

- Students may need additional support understanding the importance of source attribution and writing “in your own words.” Cultural differences may come up here. In some cases, it could be important to help parents understand these conventions, too. ▲

- Note that there is a resource called Synopsis: *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 14. This resource should only be used as necessary for students who need support. ▲

- Chapter 14 again brings up the potentially sensitive topic of the supernatural as the girls meet a boy who leads them to an abandoned cabin and, after the girls fall asleep, turns into a chupacabra and bites Pita before the girls are able to chase him off. As previously noted, supernatural content may be scary or a may be a restricted topic for some students. Allow for time to process and respond to these topics during discussion, and reach out to families as needed.

- To support ELLs, this lesson continues work with theme development in *Summer of the Mariposas*, practice with vocabulary development, and exploration of summary writing, all of which will prepare students for the mid-unit assessment.

- ELLs may find it challenging to connect themes with examples from the novel, as well as to apply their knowledge of summary writing to actual practice. In both Work Time B and Work Time C, select supports that reduce the cognitive load of tasks by breaking down and simplifying productive (writing) language tasks so that students can focus on the concepts of theme and summary.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.A.1, 8.I.A.4, 8.I.B.6, 8.I.B.7, 8.I.B.8, 8.I.C.10, 8.I.C.12, and 8.II.A.1.

Assessment Guidance

- Review student summaries after the lesson to check whether they are on the right track. Use common issues as teaching points for the whole group in the next lesson.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students continue to practice the skills of analyzing the development of themes in the text as well as building strong summaries with increased independence. They will then be assessed on their use of these skills on the mid-unit assessment.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 2**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 14 Excerpt (15 minutes)

- Review appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can determine a theme and analyze its development in *Summer of the Mariposas*, chapter 14.”

- Repeated routine: Follow the same process as with previous lessons for students to read the excerpt of chapter 14 of ***Summer of the Mariposas***, using the **Text Guide: *Summer of the Mariposas*** **(for teacher reference)**. Instruct students to read the excerpt independently and support struggling students as needed. Then have students identify the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary, add words to the **chart paper of Spanish words**, reflect on their reading as they choose, and record the gist on **sticky notes** using the following resources as appropriate: **vocabulary logs** and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- For ELLs and students who require additional support, Synopsis: Summer of the Mariposas Chapter 14▲ can be used to review the key details from the chapter.

- Gist: The five sisters meet a shepherd boy, Chencho, who turns out to be the chupacabra.

Work Time

B. Identify Development of Theme: *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 14 – RL.8.2 (10 minutes)

- Remind students that the themes of a text are the messages or main ideas relevant to the real world that the author wants the reader to take away from reading a literary text. Remind students that a text may have many themes, and we often see multiple themes emerge that are not fully developed until the end of the story. Explain to students that we want to look for the most prominent, recurring themes as we track their development throughout the story.

- Distribute students’ **Development of Theme: *Summer of the Mariposas*** **note-catchers**.

- Tell students that the purpose of the note-catcher is to track specific capture their analysis of theme and to track specific text-based examples of how theme develops. For ELLs and students who require additional support, the **Development of Theme: *Summer of the Mariposas*** **note-catcher** ▲ can be used to help guide students’ thinking by providing modeling and selected response options for previous examples of events connected to theme in *Summer of the Mariposas*.

- Model how to fill in the first row using the information from the Language Dive in Unit 2, Lesson 1, Work Time B. See **Development of Theme: *Summer of the Mariposas*** **note-catcher (for teacher reference)**.

- Direct students to the evidence in row 2 of the Development of Theme: *Summer of the Mariposas* note-catchers. Read the evidence aloud.

- Prompt students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What theme is connected to this detail?” (Things are not always as they appear.)

“How does this detail show the theme?” (This detail develops the theme that things are not always as they appear, because at first Chencho appears to be only a shepherd boy until he is revealed to be the demonic chupacabra, only to show that he is, in fact, just a sad little boy who cannot help his beastly impulses. The girls develop a deeper, more compassionate understanding of Chencho as they discover his true identity.)

“In what ways does this detail connect to learning about becoming ethical people?” Refer to the Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart for reference, as needed. (Answers will vary, but could be along the lines of: The girls recognize that regardless of the fact that Chencho is the beastly chupacabra, he still deserves to be treated with compassion as he struggles to control the beast inside him. They show him compassion by letting him go when they could’ve killed him, even though he hurt Pita.)

- Invite students to fill in the final column of the second row of the Development of Theme: *Summer of the Mariposas* note-catchers with a partner. Use **equity sticks** to invite students to share out. See Development of Theme: *Summer of the Mariposas* note-catcher (for teacher reference).

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time B, as a tactile alternative to using Develop Theme: *Summer of the Mariposas* note-catcher▲ consider providing students who may struggle with the balancing the cognitive and linguistic demands of the task of filling out the note-catcher with strips of paper with prewritten examples from column 4, and have them follow these steps to complete the organizer:

- Read column 1.

- Complete column 2.

- Choose the examples that match the theme, and then glue or tape them to column 4.

- Complete column 3.

- Approaching the task in this sequence will help guide students’ thinking around theme while reducing potential for writing proficiency to limit or delay this conceptual process.

Work Time

C. Write a Summary: *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 14 – RL.8.2 (10 minutes)

- Review appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can write an objective summary of *Summer of the Mariposas*, chapter 14.”

- Display the **Criteria for an Effective Summary anchor chart**.

- Remind students of the questions on Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 2 they responded to as they entered the classroom:

- If you have your summary paragraph from homework, what parts of your summary align with the criteria for an effective summary? What parts are missing or need some work?

- If you do not have your summary paragraph from homework, which criteria for an effective summary do you want to focus on today to push your writing and why?

- (Responses may vary.)

- Invite students to briefly Think-Pair-Share their writing goal with a partner.

- Remind students to keep this criteria in mind as they write their summary paragraph.

- Remind students that summaries briefly give us the central idea(s) and key details of a text so we can determine whether we need to read it when looking for evidence to support thinking, discussion, or writing later on, and to help us quickly remember what the text is about when describing it to others.

- Tell students that they are now going to write a summary of *Summer of the Mariposas*, chapter 14. Give them 1 minute to think. Ask students to Turn and Talk. The first student to speak (partner A) will orally summarize the chapter. Refocus the whole group and have partners switch roles. The second person to speak (partner B) will do the same, adding or removing any relevant details. ▲

- Distribute **Objective Summary: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Chapter 14 handout**. Invite students to write their brief summaries and remind them to use the Criteria for an Effective Summary anchor chart. Remind students that they may also reference their **Summarize a Literary Text rubric handout**.

- Remind students that when writing paragraphs such as a summary, they should write in complete sentences.

- Circulate to support students as they write. Note any trends to highlight during the Closing and Assessment or next lesson. Refer to **Objective Summary: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Chapter 14 (for teacher reference)**.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- For Work Time C, in addition to time spent orally summarizing before writing, create a simple graphic organizer based on the Criteria for an Effective Literary Summary anchor chart that includes space for students to focus on each individual part of the summary. This will help students to organize their ideas before writing.

For Heavier Support

N/A

Closing and Assessment

A. Review Summaries – RL.8.2 (5 minutes)

- Strategically select strong written summaries to share with the group, or highlight any trends.

- After students write their summary, invite them to annotate it with the anchor chart codes. If students haven’t considered a particular criterion, invite them to mark a placeholder code and circle it as a reminder to revise later.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- Encourage students to use the color-coding system they used in Lesson 1 to review their own and/or a partner’s summary to check that it meets all criteria on the Criteria for an Effective Summary anchor chart. This will increase the visibility of each criterion and help students to understand what they have done well and what is missing or can be improved.

For Heavier Support

- Distribute the Synopsis: *Summer of the Mariposas* Chapter 14▲, and have students check their partner’s summary for the key events in the bulleted list. This will help students to see how key events are woven into a summary, and will also draw students’ attention to how the same event or idea can be described using different language while maintaining the same meaning.

Homework

A. Answer Text-Dependent Questions and Revise Summary Paragraph

- Using **Homework: Text-Dependent Questions and Summary Revisions: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Chapter 14**, students answer selected response questions about chapter 14 of *Summer of the Mariposas* and then revise their summary paragraphs to meet the criteria.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students should preread chapter 15 of *Summer of the Mariposas* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.
