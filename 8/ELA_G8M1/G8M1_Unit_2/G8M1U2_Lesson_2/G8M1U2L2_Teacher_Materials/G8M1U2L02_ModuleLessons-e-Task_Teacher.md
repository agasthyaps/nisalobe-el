In chapter 14 of *Summer of the Mariposas*, the five sisters meet a shepherd boy, Chencho, who turns out to be the chupacabra. Odilia does not trust Chencho at first, but her young sisters want to help him and are not afraid. Eventually, the sisters convince Odilia to trust the boy, and he brings them to a cabin to spend the night. When Odilia awakes, Chencho has transformed into the chupacabra and is trying to eat Pita’s leg. Odilia stabs him in his one eye, blinding him. Chencho then begs for his life and tells them that this happens to him at night, but it is not who he is; he simply cannot help himself. When Chencho tells his sad story, the sisters decide they cannot kill the chupacabra and they let him go.  
On page 235, Odilia says, “He is just a little boy. Wounded and blind . . . we have to let him go,” which continues to develop the theme, “Things are not always as they appear.”
