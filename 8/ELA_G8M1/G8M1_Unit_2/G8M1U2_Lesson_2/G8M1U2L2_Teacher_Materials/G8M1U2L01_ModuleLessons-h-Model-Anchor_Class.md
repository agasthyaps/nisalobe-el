**Chapter 12 Model Summary**

In chapter 12 of *Summer of the Mariposas*, the five girls are captured by the nagual. However, Tonantzin comes to rescue them and defeat the nagual. When Odilia awakes in the cave, she and her sisters are tied up. The nagual has changed from his donkey form to his warlock form. The nagual is making a potion in a cauldron that will kill the sisters. It will also release the warlock from his curse and allow him to become more powerful. Odilia remembers Teresita’s advice to sing the song of the cave but she can’t remember it. She spins her earring pendant and calls on Tonantzin. She is then able to wake up her sisters and remember the song of the cave that their mother sang to them. The sisters sing the song together. The dead butterflies in the cave come to life and create the form of Tonantzin. She causes the nagual to fall into his own potion, which allows the sisters to escape the cave. On page 190, Odilia says that Tonantzin “looked like an Aztec goddess, but her face was that of a Mexican girl, the face of our many friends and cousins, a teenager, like us.” This continues to develop the theme that family and culture shapes our identity.

Be sure your summary meets the following criteria:

- Introduces the text by stating the title, author, and chapter, section, or pages

- Briefly outlines what the text is about

- Clearly states the central idea(s)

- Includes key events and the most important details from the text to explain the central idea(s) and/or theme presented

- Includes a statement of theme (the point or message the author wants you to take away) where applicable

- Remains objective without opinions or judgments

- “Wraps up” with a concluding statement

- Is short, clear and concise

A **central idea** is an important thing the author wants the reader to know and to remember when they have finished the text.
