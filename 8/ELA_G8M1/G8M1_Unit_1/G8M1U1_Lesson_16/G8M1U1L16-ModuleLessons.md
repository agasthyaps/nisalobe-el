Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- New skills are introduced in the following:

- Opening A: Review returned mid-unit assessments with feedback. The purpose of this is for students to have the opportunity to see how they performed in order to improve in their next assessment and to ask questions if they don’t understand the feedback.

- Work Time A: Students will complete their end of unit assessment by answering a short written assessment asking them about how events in the text reveal character. (RL.8.1, RL.8.3)

- SL.8.1 – Work Time B: Students will participate in a group discussion about how events in the text reveal character.

- In this lesson, the Habit of Character focus is on working to become an ethical person. The characteristics that students practice are respect, empathy, and compassion as they participate in a text-based discussion, and integrity as they work independently on assessments.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Ask students to reflect on their growth or learning between the mid-unit assessment and the end of unit assessment. Also, consider asking students to create goals for the coming unit.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous two lessons, students prepared for this assessment by generating discussion norms and using a similar graphic organizer to analyze how incidents in the text reveal aspects of character.

Support All Students

- Presenting learning targets in writing, orally, and, if possible, accompanied by symbols will help students to understand the language within them. Check for understanding of learning targets through both written and oral paraphrasing. Some students, for example, may be able to write a paraphrase of a learning target but not articulate this orally. A written paraphrase (perhaps even with illustration) can also be helpful as a fixed reference to return to. ▲

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment.

- Display sentence starters for students to refer to when stating their opinion, asking a question, referring to the text, and building upon their peers’ ideas during the text-based discussion. ▲

- This lesson supports ELLs with opportunities to practice their listening and speaking skills and to demonstrate their content and linguistic knowledge in a text-based discussion. They apply essential listening and speaking skills in the End of Unit 1 Assessment and self-reflect at the end of the lesson to acknowledge successes and chart a course for future improvements.

- ELLs may find the text-based discussion challenging and intimidating. Frame all communication from ELLs as successful risk-taking, allowing them to grapple, but rephrasing what they say, if necessary. Remind them to rely on the language tools provided during this lesson and previous ones. While assessing speaking, celebrate differences in accents. Focus on whether intonation and stress is relatively clear overall instead of only isolating the pronunciation of individual words. At the end of the lesson, encourage students to celebrate their completion of Unit 1 and the progress that they have made.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6, 8.I.B.7, and 8.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- Assessment materials (student copy, answer key, student exemplar, teacher checklist) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- Although Work Time B is an informal assessment of discussion and analysis skills, consider using the Collaborative Discussion Checklist (see Materials below) to give targeted feedback to students for their improvement on future formal discussion assessments. Since it can be challenging to assess all students’ conversation and analysis skills during a fast-paced discussion, be sure to have the checklist prepared. Also, consider using a clipboard to enable circulating during the discussions. Finally, consider video recording the discussions (even if using the whole class fishbowl format) to enable multiple viewings and even for use in providing targeted feedback to students.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will analyze themes and write summaries for *Summer of the Mariposas*.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare the following:

- Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 16

- End of Unit 1 Assessment (see Assessment Overview and Resources)

- Review the Socratic Seminar protocol.

- Ensure Mid-Unit 1 Assessments with feedback are available for each student at tables, and pass out Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 16 for students to complete as they enter class.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time A: Students may add to their graphic organizer using a word-processing tool—for example, a Google Doc—using speech-to-text facilities activated on devices or using an app or software such as http://eled.org/0103.

- Closing and Assessment A: Students may create their Track Progress folders and form in an online format—for example, using Google Forms—with a folder for each form, or via a word-processing tool such as a Google Doc, using speech-to-text facilities activated on devices or using an app or software such as http://eled.org/0103.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Return the Mid-Unit Assessments and Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- As students enter the classroom, invite them to complete **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 16** using their **Mid-Unit 1 Assessments with feedback** on their desks.

- Circulate as students review their feedback, and offer guidance and support as necessary.

- Once all students are ready, invite them to share their “stars” and “steps” with a partner. Remind students that everyone is working toward individual goals and that learning is about continued growth and development.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

- Return Mid-Unit 1 Assessments, keeping in mind that ELL writing might contain a multitude of language errors and extensive error correction may be overwhelming and unproductive. Focus on one or two pervasive errors that interfere with the meaning, like word choice, incomplete ideas expressed in sentence fragments, and critical verb tense issues. If patterns emerge among multiple students, address some of these as a class.

For Heavier Support

- Return Mid-Unit 1 Assessments, keeping in mind that ELL writing might contain a multitude of language errors and extensive error correction may be overwhelming and unproductive. Focus on one or two pervasive errors that interfere with the meaning, like word choice, incomplete ideas expressed in sentence fragments, and critical verb tense issues. If patterns emerge among multiple students, address some of these as a class.

Work Time

A. End of Unit 1 Assessment: Aspects of Character: *Summer of the Mariposas* (20 minutes)

- Review the learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze how incidents in *Summer of the Mariposas* reveal aspects of the characters.”

- Distribute **End of Unit 1 Assessment: Aspects of Character: *Summer of the Mariposas***.

- Read aloud the directions for the assessment as students read along silently. Read, reread, and rephrase. Answer clarifying questions.

- Remind students that this is an assessment. Ensure all students understand the assessment directions. Answer their questions, refraining from supplying answers to the assessment questions themselves.

- Invite students to begin working on the assessment.

For Lighter Support

- During the End of Unit 1 Assessment, encourage students to take notes as they listen to their classmates’ contributions to the discussion to track the evidence that is incorporated and to build listening skills through note-taking and written processing.

For Heavier Support

- During the End of Unit 1 Assessment, it may take longer for some students to process language and follow the conversation during the text-based discussion. Encourage students to speak up when they would like to hear something repeated. Display questions students can ask to regulate the pace of the conversation (e.g., *“Can you please repeat what you said?” “Can you please speak more slowly?”*).

Work Time

B. Text-Based Discussion – SL.8.1 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can come to a discussion prepared and draw on that preparation by referring to evidence on the text and topic.”

“I can follow discussion norms to have an effective text-based discussion.”

- Focus students on all of the characteristics on the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**: respect, compassion, and empathy in preparation for the discussion. Review what each characteristic looks like and sounds like.

- Focus students on the **Discussion Norms anchor chart**, specifically on the cues and responses. Remind them that a discussion is not just about saying what they want to say and then they are done. Effective participation is about listening to others and asking and answering questions to be completely clear about what others are saying and to clarify their own points.

- Facilitate a brief Socratic Seminar discussion (see Unit 1, Lesson 15, Work Time C, and Teaching Notes) by inviting students to share their responses to the following questions:

“What does the encounter with the nagual reveal about Odilia and Juanita?”

- If productive, use a Goal 1 Conversation Cue to encourage students to expand their responses to the text-dependent questions by giving examples.

“Can you say more about that?”

“Can you give an example?”

Closing and Assessment

A. Reflect on Learning Targets (5 minutes)

- Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target, using a checking for understanding technique—for example, thumbs-up or traffic-light signal cards. Scan student responses, and make a note of students who might need support. Check in with them moving forward.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- If students seem unsure of how to respond to the open-ended questions on the Track Progress: Collaborative Discussion handout, provide examples of statements that answer the questions about previous improvements and goals for future improvement that are directly connected to the criteria within the handout. This helps students create clear self-reflection and concrete, attainable personal targets (e.g., *“I have improved at referring to evidence on the topic, text, or issue.” “In the future, I will improve at acknowledging new information that others express”*).

Homework

A. Preread Anchor Text

- Students should preread chapter 13 of Summer of the Mariposas in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.
