Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- New skills are introduced in the following:

- RL.8.4, L.8.4 – Opening B: Students will generate strategies for determining the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary. Students then practice the strategies when reading the next chapter of *Summer of the Mariposas* in Work Time A, focusing on word parts, especially affixes.

- RL.8.1 – Work Time A: Students will use evidence to support their answers to text-dependent questions focused on point of view.

- In this lesson, the directions for routines that are repeated from previous lessons have been pared down and noted with “Repeated routine.” For the detailed outline of how to facilitate this part of the lesson, please refer back to previous lessons.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Students may begin tracking the juxtaposition of La Llorona and the sisters’ mother. La Llorona’s sons ran away from her, and the girls are about to run away from their mother. La Llorona says she was arguing with her sons’ father before they ran away, and the sisters are in the midst of a dysfunction because of their father’s abandonment and their mother’s negligence.

- Students may research the folklore in this chapter (e.g., La Llorona, Aztecs, Medusa, Tonantzin, Cihuacóatl, Tenochtitlán).

How It Builds on Previous Work

- This work builds on the previous lessons as students continue to read the *Summer of the Mariposas*, identify the gist of each chapter, and record new vocabulary in their vocabulary logs. They also continue to analyze the effects created by the differences in point of view between the reader and the characters.

Support All Students

- In Work Time A, some students may find the supernatural content of the chapter frightening. Be prepared to support those students by focusing on the author’s craft, purpose, and choices. Also, be aware that in chapter 3 of *Summer of the Mariposas*, the word *prostitute* is used as a description of how the dead man looked once wearing makeup. How and if it is necessary to address the use and meaning of this word will depend on the student population.

- In Work Time A, provide choice in how to carry out the reading portion of the lesson: some students may prefer to read independently and silently, while others (especially ELLs) may wish to read aloud in groups with peers and/or with support. Still others may wish to read silently for a few pages and then process with a group. ▲

- In Work Time A, present additional options for recording gist rather than just the sticky note, such as using a separate notebook, using a graphic organizer, using highlighters and annotating, or using a voice recorder. Give students options for expressing their understanding of gist (oral, written, drawing). Also, build in different options for expressing comprehension of the text (written reflection, voice recording, discussion with partners/groups). ▲

- When grouping students in triads to answer text-dependent questions in Work Time B, group ELLs with partners who have more advanced or native language proficiency. The partners with greater language proficiency can serve as a model, initiating discussions and providing implicit sentence frames, for example. ▲

- Note that chapter 3 of *Summer of the Mariposas* brings up potentially sensitive topics such as a ghostly apparition, La Llorona, her drowned children, and the mother goddess, Tonantzin, who is referred to as the mother of all mankind. Some students and their families may find this topic to be in conflict with their religious views, and some students may find this content scary or upsetting. Allow for time to process and respond to these topics during discussion, and reach out to families as needed.

- To support ELLs, this lesson focuses on strategies for determining the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary and gist. Students use vocabulary logs to help with the acquisition of new vocabulary and gist-note strategies to build comprehension of *Summer of the Mariposas*. These strategies help ELLs to advance their understanding of the text and the language within it.

- If they have previous knowledge of the La Llorona legend, ELLs may find it challenging to differentiate between their own background knowledge of the La Llorona legend and the information found within *Summer of the Mariposas*. It is important to help students to clarify the distinction between where the two may overlap or diverge to support the development of reading skills and metacognitive awareness of strategies. To this end, invite students to share background knowledge before reading. Then, revisit the background knowledge once students have gained text-based knowledge, and discuss background in light of the topic or text, highlighting the differences.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6, 8.I.B.7, and 8.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- As students work in triads to answer text-dependent questions in Work Time B, listen to discussions to determine how close students are to understanding how to answer questions related to RL.8.6 to determine any common issues that could be used as teaching points for the whole group.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will be guided through a close read of an informational text about the folklore of Latin America to build background knowledge now that they have been introduced to La Llorona in *Summer of the Mariposas*, and they will answer questions about the central ideas in the text. They will continue to practice using strategies to determine the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary as listed on the Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students complete **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 4.**

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine to focus students on the word *identify* in the first learning target and to use a dictionary to define the word. With students’ support, record the meaning of *identify* on the **academic word wall**. Invite students to record the word in their **vocabulary logs.**

Opening

B. Strategies to Determine the Meaning of Unfamiliar Vocabulary – RL.8.4 (5 minutes)

- Review the answer to the question posted on the board:

“What is the meaning of *unfamiliar*, and what strategy did you use to determine the meaning?” (Unfamiliar—not known or experienced before.)

- Focus students on the second part of the question:

“What strategy did you use to determine the meaning?”

- Direct students’ attention to the new **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart**. Explain that the class will record strategies for reading new texts on this anchor chart. Record the strategies students suggest on this anchor chart. See **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart (example for teacher reference),** and ensure all of the suggested strategies are represented.

- Distribute the **affix list**, and use the word *unfamiliar* in the question posted on the board to provide a brief explanation of how to use it by discussing the contents of each column. Note on the Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart that one strategy to help them define unfamiliar words is to use affixes as clues.

- With students’ support, record the meaning of *unfamiliar* (not known or experienced before) on the academic word wall and the meaning of *affix* (an additional element placed at the beginning or end of a root, stem, or word, or in the body of a word, to change its meaning) on the **domain-specific word wall**, with translations in students’ home languages. Write synonyms or sketch a visual above each key term to scaffold students’ understanding.

- Invite students to record these words in their vocabulary logs. Prompt students to use the word or phrase in a new sentence by either writing that sentence down or thinking of that sentence silently, then sharing with a partner.

- If time allows, invite students to return to previous vocabulary log entries and identify and underline affixes from the affix list in those words. ▲

For Lighter Support

- In Opening B, use a Spanish word from the text to practice determining the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary words. This can bolster Spanish-speaking students’ confidence, highlights the process, and builds empathy in non-Spanish speaking students toward those who are navigating unfamiliar words in a new language.

For Heavier Support

- Invite students to share words they have recorded in the vocabulary logs with the class; students can use these words for additional practice with analyzing affixes, in partners or as a whole class, to reinforce strategies for determining the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary. Students can use a chart to break down the affixes in words, or they can use different colored markers to highlight prefixes, root words, and suffixes in their vocabulary logs.

Work Time

A. Read *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 3 Excerpt (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same process as with previous lessons for students to read the excerpt of chapter 3 of ***Summer of the Mariposas***, using the **Text Guide: *Summer of the Mariposas* (for teacher reference)**. Instruct students to read the excerpt independently and support struggling students as needed. If students do not finish reading the chapter within the allotted reading time, distribute **Synopsis: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Chapter 3** to each student to review the key details from the chapter. Then have students identify the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary, add words to the **chart paper of Spanish words**, reflect on their reading as they choose, and record the gist on **sticky notes** using the following resources as appropriate: vocabulary logs and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Gist: Odilia meets La Llorona, who tells her to take the dead body to Mexico.

- Be aware that some students may express fear of the supernatural content of this chapter. Prepare to support those students by focusing on author’s craft. Ask questions to encourage students to think of the purpose of including this kind of content. For example:

“Why do you think the author included supernatural figures in this chapter? What does it do for the reader?” (Responses will vary, but may include the following: the author may have included supernatural figures to introduce elements of Mexican folklore and also to make the novel exciting and engaging.)

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time A, share photos or drawings of aliens, monsters, and ghosts on an overhead display to clarify the meaning of *supernatural* to ensure students understand the meaning of this term before engaging in discussion.

For Heavier Support

Work Time

B. Analyze Point of View: *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 3 Excerpt – RL.8.6 (15 minutes)

- Group students strategically into triads, and display and distribute **Text-Dependent Questions: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Chapter 3**. Read each of the questions aloud as students read along silently, and explain that students will work together to answer the questions focused on point of view. Focus students on the **Analyze Point of View anchor chart**, and briefly review what they learned in the previous lesson, particularly about how the author reveals what the narrator is thinking or feeling that the other characters in the novel don’t know. Remind students to record the gist on sticky notes and to refer to the **Strategies to Answer Selected Response Questions anchor chart.**

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share about the following questions relating point of view and Habits of Character. (Refer to the Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart for reference.)

“How can analyzing point of view help readers understand more about how characters show respect, empathy, compassion or integrity?” (Looking closely at point of view helps the reader identify certain effects \[like humor\], but it also helps the reader understand more about characters, reasons behind actions they take, or decisions they make. It can help the reader more deeply understand the characters and plot and therefore identify any aspects of their showing empathy or compassion.)

“What are you learning about a particular character’s ability to show empathy?” (La Llorona shows empathy for Odilia. She gives Odilia the ear pendant, because Llorona knows the journey will be challenging and the ear pendant will support her in times of challenge.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time B, have each triad of students focus on one of the text-dependent questions. Then, invite each group to share out to the whole class and explain how they determined the answer. This will allow for deep, thoughtful processing and help to make thinking transparent in service to building competence in answering text-dependent questions.

Closing and Assessment

A. Review Answers: Point of View: *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 3 Excerpt – RL.8.6 (5 minutes)

- Refocus all students. Use **Text-Dependent Questions: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Chapter 3 (answers for teacher reference)** to review answers to questions with students. Update the Analyze Point of View anchor chart accordingly. See **Analyze Point of View anchor chart (example for teacher reference).**

- Guide students to chorally read aloud the question on the Analyze Point of View anchor chart and then Think-Pair-Share their ideas about the answer:

“How does the author use differences in the points of view of the characters and the reader to create effects like suspense or humor?” (Using first person point of view, the author enables the reader to see some events that the other characters don’t see, which builds suspense because we know what the narrator is thinking and feeling in response to what is happening. We take on the feelings of the narrator.)

- Update the anchor chart accordingly. See Analyze Point of View anchor chart (example for teacher reference).

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Homework

A. Determine Meanings of Unfamiliar Words and Phrases

- Using **Homework: Unfamiliar Vocabulary: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Chapter 3 Part I**, students answer a combination of selected response and short constructed response questions that ask them to determine the meanings of unfamiliar words and phrases.
