Determine Themes: *Summer of the Mariposas* Anchor Chart

RL.8.1, RL.8.2

(Example for Teacher Reference)

The **themes** of a text are the messages or main ideas relevant to the real world that the author wants the reader to take away from reading a literary text. There is often more than one theme in a text.

Authors develop themes with pieces of evidence that support the theme called **key details**. Often, the author reveals a message through key details such as repeated ideas or concepts, a conflict or change a character experiences and learns from, or advice offered by wise characters in the text. As you read a text, think about the real-world message the author wants you to understand and take away from the text, and gather details to confirm your original thinking about the theme(s).
