Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 12

L.8.1

(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, answer the following questions.

This is a run-on sentence:

> **I am being rude I have not introduced myself.**

What do you think a run-on sentence is?

A run-on sentence has two parts that could each be their own sentence.

How would you revise this to not be a run-on sentence?

The revision should look like this: “I am being rude. I have not introduced myself.”
