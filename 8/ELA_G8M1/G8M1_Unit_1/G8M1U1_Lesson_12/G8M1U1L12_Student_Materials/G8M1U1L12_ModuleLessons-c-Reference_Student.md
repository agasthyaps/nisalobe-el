Chapter 10

**Name:** **Date:**

- The sisters find the seer, Teresita.

- Teresita read their “cards” and foretells the various trials and demons they will encounter on their journey because of their unkindness toward Cecilia.

- Odilia tells the sisters about La Llorona’s appearances and how La Llorona warned her to be pure of heart, but Odilia did not tell her sisters because she had not believed that all of this would be real.

- Teresita warns the sisters about an evil trinity of Cecilia’s “children”: a warlock (*nagual*), the coven of barn-owls (*lechuzas*), and the bloodthirsty *chupacabras*.
