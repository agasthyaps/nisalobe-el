English Language Learners: Grade 8: Module 1: Unit 1: Teaching Notes

Build Background Knowledge: Read and Analyze *Summer of the Mariposas*

Teaching Notes for Unit 1

Prioritize Lessons for Classrooms with Many ELLs

To prepare for the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment, prioritize and expand point-of-view instruction in Lessons 3, 4, and 7 and work with figurative language and point of view in Lessons 8, 9, 10, as well as vocabulary strategies instruction in Lessons 3, 4, and 9. The Language Dives in Lessons 5, 9, and 10 greatly help ELLs to gain further understanding of the structure of the English language. In all lessons, support that integrates written and oral input should be provided to ELLs while reviewing learning targets and assigning homework. It may be useful to provide instructions for homework orally and in writing and to invite students to check their understanding of the homework assignment with a partner.

Language Dives

Students are introduced in Lesson 5 to their first Language Dive, which focuses on a sentence from an informational text on Latin American folklore, to practice determining the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary to address standards L.8.4a and L.8.4b and to gain familiarity with citing textual evidence to address R.8.1. In Lessons 9 and 10, they complete a two-part Language Dive on a sentence from the class novel, *Summer of the Mariposas*, that addresses standards RL.8.4, L.8.5a, and L.8.5b to explore how word relationships and figurative language assume meaning in a sentence. A Language Dive empowers students to analyze, understand, and use the language of academic sentences, which can often seem opaque to students. During a Language Dive, slow down for 10–20 minutes to examine the meaning, purpose, and structure of a compelling sentence from a complex text, model, learning target, checklist, or rubric included in the curriculum. This process invites students to unpack complex syntax, or “academic phrases,” as a way to build both literacy and habits of mind. Students then apply their understanding of language structure as they work toward the assessments and performance task. Through the Language Dive’s engaging Deconstruct-Reconstruct-Practice routine, students play with “chunks” of the sentence, interpreting them, rearranging them, and using them to talk about their own lives or lesson content. As a result of paying close attention to how language works, all students begin to acquire the necessary facility with academic English, and ELLs foster their overall language ability. A consistent Language Dive routine is critical in helping all students learn how to decipher complex sentences and write their own.

Most Language Dives implicitly address a wide range of Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening, and Language standards. Once comfortable with Language Dives, consider supplementing the focus standards in a particular Language Dive with additional standards to meet students’ needs. Note that the Rationale section of each Language Dive also identifies supporting standards that are explicitly addressed but are not the main focus of the Language Dive.

Note: Some responses to questions in the Language Dive indicate only that “Responses will vary.” Like one the larger goals of Language Dives, “Responses will vary” is intended to suggest that students should be encouraged to grapple with questions and ideas, develop interest and participation, and not be immediately steered toward “correct” responses. Indeed, even where correct responses are provided, consider continuing to invite a culture of inquiry and grappling.

Diversity and Inclusion

Investigate the routines, practices, rituals, beliefs, norms, and experiences that are important to ELLs and their families. Integrate this background into the classroom as students explore the class novel, *Summer of the Mariposas*. Much of the work that students carry out during this unit is centered on this text, which tells the story of a group of five Mexican-American sisters who set out on a sometimes challenging, but magical, journey. Invite students to share any connections they may have made with the text to honor those whose own backgrounds may be similar to the that of the characters. Hispanic students may have some familiarity with the modernized versions of popular stories from Latin American folklore woven throughout the story, like La Llorona, the chupacabras, and the lechuzas. Be mindful of potential fear, hesitation, or distress among students in discussing the topic of border crossing. Create space for students to express their feelings about sensitive issues embedded in the novel, knowing that these discussions may help create equity or unearth trauma, or both. Remind students that everyone is working toward improvement. This fosters a supportive and inclusive classroom environment. Be sure to highlight and praise growth and development rather than relative performance. Use as a topic or text warmer or reflection with the entire class: a check-in at any strategic point during the unit to continually connect students’ personal experiences to the topic or text and to share how each one has changed and grown in association with the other. Consult with a guidance counselor, school social worker, or ESL teacher for further investigation of diversity and inclusion.

Conversation Cues

Encourage productive and equitable conversation with Conversation Cues, which are questions to ask students that help achieve four goals:

- (Goal 1) encourage all students to talk and be understood;

- (Goal 2) listen carefully to one another and seek to understand;

- (Goal 3) deepen thinking; and

- (Goal 4) think with others to expand the conversation (adapted from Michaels, Sarah, and Cathy O’Connor. “Talk Science Primer.” *The Inquiry Project*, TERC, 2012, inquiryproject.terc.edu/shared/pd/TalkScience_Primer.pdf. Based on Chapin, Suzanne H., et al. *Classroom Discussions: Using Math Talk to Help Students Learn, Grades K–6*. 2nd ed, Math Solutions, 2009.)

Refer to the Tools Page (http://eled.org/tools) for the complete set of cues. Goal 1 Conversation Cues are introduced in Lesson 1, and suggestions for integrating Conversation Cues into instruction are presented across lessons. For ELLs, Conversation Cues are especially critical because they improve language-processing abilities and increase engagement and participation.

Strategic Grouping

Students work in pairs and small groups during text-based discussions, Language Dives, and other tasks. For Language Dives and other tasks that focus on language, consider matching ELLs with a partner who has greater language proficiency in English. For text-based discussions that focus on gist, point of view, characters, theme, and main ideas, consider pairing ELLs with students who share the same native language to allow for rich discussion around ideas. The conversations that happen as a result of such strategic pairing greatly serve the language development of both partners.

In-Class Reading

In the majority of lessons in this unit, students spend 20 minutes reading the class novel, *Summer of the Mariposas*. ELLs benefit from a gradual-release approach to in-class reading that increases their level of independence over time. For heavier support, ELLs may find it helpful to follow along during a read-aloud, and for lighter support, students can take turns reading aloud from the text and following along in small groups.

Analyze Point of View

In Lesson 3, students are introduced to the concept of point of view and analyze how differences in *Summer of the Mariposas* in the points of view of the characters and the reader create effects like suspense or humor. A point-of-view anchor chart helps all students, but especially ELLs, in navigating this work. To facilitate deeper support, create an additional anchor chart that tracks the key traits and experiences of characters throughout the novel. Students might also benefit from using a tracker that allows them to record how their interpretations and reactions to the events in the novel change over time.

Text-Based Discussions

Break down content, share-outs, or tasks into two parts for ELLs: cognitive and linguistic. First, invite home-language use to allow students to more comfortably process their ideas. This allows students to focus first on the cognitive demands necessary when approaching particularly demanding content or tasks before engaging in informal share-outs or formal discussions. In addition, inviting home-language use helps students build academic mindsets. After they have met the cognitive demands in their home language, they can be invited to discuss the task in classroom English, a language they are still learning. ELLs may require extra support in preparation for the End of Unit 1 Assessment, in which students apply knowledge and strategies connected to listening, speaking, and reading skills areas to a culminating text-based discussion.

Differentiated Note-Catchers

Differentiated note-catchers are available for ELLs and other students who would benefit from an increased level of support. These resources have been modified for the purposes of creating accessibility to content and concepts and supporting language development. Depending upon the task being carried out with a note-catcher, images, selected response options, answer banks, sentence frames, or model responses have been embedded to guide students’ thinking without compromising a focus on standards and the skills that students are developing and applying to meet them.

Celebration

Celebrate the courage, enthusiasm, diversity, and bilingual assets that ELLs bring to the classroom. Additionally, students can celebrate their successful attempts at communication, focusing on progress rather than perfection.
