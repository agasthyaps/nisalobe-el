Resource 8

“I have always been fascinated by the knowledge and wisdom of our ancestors, the *Aztecas*. Their culture, their scientific observations, their religion, their architecture, their language, their myths and legends—everything about them is extraordinary.”

McCall, Guadalupe Garcia*. Summer of the Mariposas*. Lee & Low, New York, 2017.

Resource 9

“I think of La Llorona in all her various mythological and legendary forms, and I feel sorry for her. As Malitzin, the Aztec slave girl given to Hernán Cortés, I find her to be one of our culture’s most controversial and misunderstood historical figures.”

McCall, Guadalupe Garcia. *Summer of the Mariposas*. Lee & Low, New York, 2017.

Resource 10

“‘My sisters are waiting,’ I said, trying to take my hand from hers so that I might escape if I had to.

La Llorona let go of my hand. ‘Please, try to have faith. I am here in your service, to guide and protect you,’ she said.

I put my hands under my arms to warm them. ‘Protect me? From what?’”

McCall, Guadalupe Garcia. *Summer of the Mariposas*. Lee & Low, New York, 2017.

Resource 11

“Everything is possible when you step into the magically real world of Latin American folklore—a buzzard can change places with a wife’s lazy husband; a hunter may hurl lightning bolts and thunder down on the tribesmen who cheated him of his share of the meat; . . . and the lizard a padre scoops off a dusty road may become an emerald when he hands it to a poor peasant who needs to buy medicine for his wife. . . . The folktales deal with timeless key human questions, and there are human truths in the magic they contain.”
