Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 7

RL.8.4, L.8.4b

(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, answer the following questions.

“I watched the road ahead for a good place to turn around, but when I looked back, the woman was gone. **Disappeared**, like she’d never been there” (77).

Use your affix list to break up the word **disappeared** into affixes and roots using a format like the one below.

|            |            |
|------------|------------|
| **Prefix** | **dis-**   |
| **Root**   | **appear** |
| **Suffix** | **-ed**    |

Then use this analysis to figure out the meaning.

Student responses will vary, but may include the following: vanished, because *dis-* means “the opposite of” and *appear* means to come in sight, so *vanishing* makes sense because it would be removing from site. Also, if you replace *disappeared* with *vanished*, the sentence still makes sense.
