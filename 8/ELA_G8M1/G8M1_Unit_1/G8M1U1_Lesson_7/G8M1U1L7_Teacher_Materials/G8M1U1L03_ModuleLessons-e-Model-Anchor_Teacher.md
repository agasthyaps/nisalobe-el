**Analyze Point of View**

The **point of view** in narrative texts is the narrator’s position in relation to the story being told. It shows the opinions or feelings of the individuals involved in a situation. Point of view is the way the author allows the reader to “hear” and “see” what is happening.

Authors often create differences between different characters’ points of view, as well as your point of view as a reader. Different characters have different feelings and opinions about what is going on, and so do readers. These differences in point of view between characters and the audience can create different effects, such as suspense or humor.

**How does the author use differences in the points of view of the characters and the reader to create effects like suspense or humor?**

- Using the first person point of view, the author enables the reader to see some events that the other characters don’t see.

- The author reveals to the reader what the narrator is thinking or feeling that the characters in the novel don’t know.

- We feel the feelings of the narrator.

<td><strong>Chapter 2, pages 32–33:</strong> Beginning at “What are you doing here?” on page 32 and ending at “. . . it’s not an emergency” on page 33.</td>
<td><strong>The reader knows that there really is an emergency because the girls found a body and want to take it back to Mexico.</strong></td>

It wasn’t at all how I had planned our night to end, but I figured all hope wasn’t lost. It was just easier to let my sisters think they’d won. However, the instant I buckled up I promised myself I’d surrender the body when we got to the international bridge—no matter what.</td>
<td><strong>The reader knows that Odilia has a plan to stop her sisters’ plans and to do the right thing, while her sisters think Odilia is on board with their plan.</strong></td>
<td><strong>It creates the effect of suspense about exactly what Odilia is going to do and how her sisters are going to react. In some ways, this also creates a sense of relief, because Odilia plans to prevent the girls from doing anything silly or dangerous that might get them into trouble. In some ways, it also creates disappointment, because there is some excitement in what they have planned.</strong></td>

“Fine. Don’t tell me, I don’t care! I don’t have to know!” Juanita clamped her mouth shut and stalked off. If I’d known the truth was the one thing that could shut Juanita up for good, I would have stopped lying to her years ago.</td>
<td><strong>The reader knows that Odilia was telling the truth and she really had been talking to La Llorona.</strong></td>
<td><strong>It creates the effect of relief because Odilia clearly didn’t want Juanita to know the truth, so when Juanita doesn’t believe the truth the reader is relieved.</strong></td>

<td><p><strong>Chapter 5, pages 76–77:</strong><br />
As I drove out of town I saw an ancient woman standing in a blighted field. She stood watching me, her long gray hair caught in the wind like wisps of silver thread. I couldn’t see the details of her long tunic dress from this distance, but I could tell it was old and graying.</p>
<p>“Llorona?” I whispered, slowing down to get a better look, but as I did, the mysterious woman turned away from me. I watched the road ahead for a good place to turn around, but when I looked back, the woman was gone. Disappeared, like she’d never been there.</p>
<p>As I sped away, I had a suspicious feeling that I was needed back at our secluded rest stop, and I was right.</p></td>
<td><strong>That Odilia sees La Llorona standing in a field and knows she needs to get back to her sisters because something isn’t right.</strong></td>
<td><strong>It creates suspense because La Llorona has shown herself to Odilia for a reason, and seeing her leaves Odilia with the feeling she needs to return to her sisters. Like Odilia, we are worried about what has happened to her sisters.</strong></td>
