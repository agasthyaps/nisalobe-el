Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- This lesson is similar in structure to Lesson 4.

- RL.8.1 – Work Time B: Students will choose strong evidence to aid in analyzing point of view.

- RL.8.6 – Work Time B: Students will work in triads to answer text-dependent questions focused on analyzing point of view.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Students could write about the difference in the impact of chapters 4 and 5 of *Summer of the Mariposas* if they were written from the point of view of Pita, Juanita, Delia, Velia, or another character. Students could rewrite the chapter(s) or part of the chapter from another perspective.

- Students could choose to research the border patrol between Mexico and the United States as referenced in chapters 4 and 5.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- This work builds on the previous lessons as students continue to read *Summer of the Mariposas*, identify the gist of each chapter, and record new vocabulary in their vocabulary logs. They also continue to analyze the effects created by the differences in point of view between the reader and the characters.

Support All Students

- In Work Time A, provide choice in how to carry out the reading portion of the lesson: some students may prefer to read independently and silently, while others (especially ELLs) may wish to read aloud in groups with peers and/or with support. Still others may wish to read silently for a few pages and then process with a group. This format of choice could potentially be built into the reading time within each lesson. ▲

- As in previous lessons, in Work Time A, present additional options for recording gist rather than just the sticky note, such as using a separate notebook, using a graphic organizer, using highlighters and annotating, or using a voice recorder. Give students options for expressing their understanding of gist (oral, written, drawing). Also, build in different options for expressing comprehension of the text (written reflection, voice recording, discussion with partners/groups). ▲

- Chapter 5 brings up the potentially sensitive topics of the girls bribing an officer and telling a lie to hide their story. This is an opportunity to discuss the potential consequences of lying and to reinforce the idea that what the girls are doing could get them into a lot of trouble.

- When grouping students in triads to answer text-dependent questions in Work Time B, group ELLs with partners who have more advanced or native language proficiency. The partners with greater language proficiency can serve as a model, initiating discussions and providing implicit sentence frames, for example. Use the same triad grouping as in Lessons 4 and 5 if this grouping was successful. This will support students in building trust and becoming more comfortable and confident with their peers. ▲

- This lesson supports ELLs through continued analysis of the way point of view impacts the story in *Summer of the Mariposas*. Students continue the familiar routine of in-class reading and building strategies for determining the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary and gist. A focus on word parts and affixes is especially valuable to ELLs as they build strategies for determining the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary.

- ELLs may find it challenging to answer text-dependent questions about *Summer of the Mariposas*. To set ELLs up for success, thoughtfully and strategically pair them with strong peers who can model effective approaches to interpreting and answering text-dependent questions.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6, 8.I.B.7, and 8.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- As students work in triads to answer text-dependent questions in Work Time B, listen to discussions to determine how close students are to understanding how to answer questions related to RL.8.6 to determine any common issues that could be used as teaching points for the whole group.

- Check student vocabulary logs for accountability in recording vocabulary.

- Check gist statements to ensure students are recording quick notes about what the text is mostly about.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue the work from the beginning of the unit analyzing the effect of the differences in point of view between the reader the characters in preparation for the mid-unit assessment in Lesson 11. In the next lesson, students will also begin the first in a series of three lessons about figurative language.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RL.8.4 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As they arrive, students complete **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 7**.

- Once all students are ready, invite them to share how they broke down the word *disappeared*, and complete an example on the board:

| Prefix |     |
|--------|-----|
| Root   |     |
| Suffix |     |

- Ask

“What do you think the meaning of the word is from analyzing the affixes and roots?” (Student responses will vary, but may include the following: vanished, because dis means the opposite of, and appear means to come into view, so the opposite of coming into view is vanishing. If you replace *disappeared* with *vanished* the sentence still makes sense.)

“How did breaking down the word into affixes and roots help you determine the meaning?” (Student responses will vary, but may include the following: finding the meaning of parts of the word helped to figure out the meaning of the whole word.)

- Invite a student to guide the class through checking the definition in a dictionary, and invite a student to add the word and definition to the **domain-specific word wall**, with translations in home languages where appropriate.

- Have students use the word *disappeared* in a new sentence on their Entrance Ticket 1, Lesson 7 to reinforce understanding of the word’s meaning. ▲

- Invite students to Think-Pair-Share their new sentences including the word *disappeared* with a partner.

- Add any relevant notes to the vocabulary strategies on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart.**

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 5 Excerpt (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same process as with previous lessons for students to read the excerpt of chapter 5 of ***Summer of the Mariposas***, using the **Text Guide: *Summer of the Mariposas*** **(for teacher reference)**. Instruct students to read the excerpt independently and support struggling students as needed. If students do not finish reading the chapter within the allotted reading time, distribute **Synopsis: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Chapter 5** to each student to review the key details from the chapter. Then have students identify the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary, add words to the **chart paper of Spanish words**, reflect on their reading as they choose, and record the gist on **sticky notes** using the following resources as appropriate: **vocabulary logs** and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Gist: The sisters begin journey through Mexico and have some conflict on the way.

- Prompt students to think about examples of Habits of Character they read about in chapter 5. Direct students to Turn and Talk about challenges the characters faced to show empathy to each other.

“Where were characters challenged to show empathy, compassion, integrity or respect to one another in this chapter?” (The girls had many arguments and were often challenged to show their best to one another; for example, Pita bit Velia’s arm when Pita was scared and upset. But Odilia shows compassion for Pita when she returns from the store and cares for her.)

- Note that in chapter 5 of *Summer of the Mariposas*, the girls tell lies to hide their story. This is an opportunity to discuss the potential consequences of lying and to reinforce the idea that what the girls are doing could get them into a lot of trouble.

For Lighter Support

- Model strategies for understanding text-dependent questions (e.g., *underlining key vocabulary; looking up the meaning of unfamiliar words in a dictionary; paraphrasing the question silently, orally, or in writing*) and for finding answers to questions in text (e.g., *referring to gist sticky notes, highlighted vocabulary, and annotations*).

Work Time

B. Analyze Point of View: *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 5 Excerpt – RL.8.6 (15 minutes)

- Group students strategically into triads, and display and distribute **Text-Dependent Questions: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Chapter 5**. Read aloud each of the questions as students read along silently, and explain that students will work together to answer the questions focused on point of view.

- Focus students on the **Analyze Point of View anchor chart**, and briefly review what they learned in the previous lesson, particularly revealing what the narrator is thinking or feeling that that the other characters in the novel don’t know.

- Remind students to use their **affix lists** and the **Strategies to Answer Selected Response Questions anchor chart** where necessary and to record the gist on sticky notes.

- Direct students to Turn and Talk about their understanding of the word *spurted* by asking the following questions.

“What is your understanding of the meaning of this word, and how could you use it in an additional sentence?

For Heavier Support

- If students are struggling to respond to question 4 Parts A, B, or C on Text-Dependent Questions: *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 5, provide hints on sticky notes to help direct students to relevant paragraphs, sentences, and key vocabulary on pages 76–77 of the text:

- Part A: page 76, paragraph 4

- Part B: page 77, paragraph 2: *mysterious*; paragraph 3: *suspicious*

- Part C: page 77, paragraph 3

Closing and Assessment

A. Review Answers: Point of View: *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 5 – RL.8.6 (10 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Refocus all students. Use **Text-Dependent Questions: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Chapter 5 (answers for teacher reference)** to review answers to questions with students. Update the Analyze Point of View anchor chart accordingly. See **Analyze Point of View anchor chart (example for teacher reference).**

- With students’ support, record the meanings of vocabulary words in the Text-Dependent Questions (*spurted* —suddenly and forcefully; *blighted* —spoiled, ruined, or destroyed; *coltish* —like a young horse) on the domain-specific word wall, with translations in students’ home languages. Write synonyms or sketch a visual above each key term to scaffold students’ understanding. Invite students to record these words in their vocabulary logs.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- Use the discussion to promote speaking and listening skills development, including attentive listening and retelling. Invite students to paraphrase what a peer says to model peer language. Because students are accustomed to sharing out their own answer, explain that this is helpful for building oral skills. Display a frame on the board or an overhead display: **“(Name of student) said . . . ”**

For Heavier Support

- In advance, prepare selected response answers to share with the class as options while reviewing the text-dependent questions if it becomes clear that students have struggled to generate correct answers.

Homework

A. Determine the Meaning of Unfamiliar Vocabulary

- Using **Homework: Unfamiliar Vocabulary: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Chapter 5**, students answer a combination of selected response and short constructed response questions that ask them to determine the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary and state their strategies for doing so.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students should preread chapter 6 of *Summer of the Mariposas* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.
