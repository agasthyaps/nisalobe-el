Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RL.8.4, L.8.5 – Opening A: Students will distinguish among the connotations of words with similar definitions.

- RL.8.4, L.8.5 – Work Time B: Students will analyze literal and figurative meaning in texts in a two-part Language Dive that focuses on a sentence from chapter 7 in *Summer of the Mariposas*.

- RL.8.6 – Closing and Assessment A: Students will analyze point of view in the chapter on an exit ticket. The questions on this exit ticket are similar in structure to the questions students will be asked on the mid-unit assessment in Lesson 11.

- RL.8.6 – Closing and Assessment A: Students will use strong evidence to support their analysis of point of view in the chapter on an exit ticket.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Students could identify a sentence in the chapter containing a word with a clear connotation and suggest replacements for this word with the same connotation and with different connotations to analyze how the use of this word impacts meaning in the sentence (L.8.5c).

How It Builds on Previous Work

- The reading in this lesson builds on the previous lessons as students continue to read *Summer of the Mariposas*, identify the gist of each chapter, and record new vocabulary in their vocabulary logs.

- The point-of-view analysis in Closing and Assessment A of this lesson builds on the point-of-view analysis work students have done on previous chapters of the text.

Support All Students

- In Work Time A, provide choice in how to carry out the reading portion of the lesson: some students may prefer to read independently and silently, while others (especially ELLs) may wish to read aloud in groups with peers and/or with support. Still others may wish to read silently for a few pages and then process with a group. This format of choice could potentially be built into the reading time within each lesson. ▲

- In Work Time B, use strategic grouping during the Language Dive to form small groups of students who share the same home language, with one or more proficient native English-speaking students added to each group to create a balance and range of similar and diverse perspectives on the structure of the English language. ▲

- Note that chapter 7 of *Summer of the Mariposas* brings up potentially sensitive topics such as the girls casting a spell, hypnotizing the dead man’s family in order to trick them into believing their story, and learning that they are listed as “missing” in the newspaper. As spells and magic may be a scary or restricted topic for students, and missing children may be a sensitive topic, allow for time to process and respond to these topics during discussion, and reach out to families as needed.

- To support ELLs, this lesson gives ELLs an in-depth look at figurative language through the first part of a two-day Language Dive. Students closely analyze the use of simile and metaphor in a sentence from chapter 7 of the text and practice using these devices in their own writing. Students also continue their in-class reading of the novel and their work with point of view.

- ELLs may find it challenging to navigate unfamiliar vocabulary and figurative language devices during the Language Dive. Remind them that the purpose of Language Dives is to deepen their understanding of the text and of structure in the English language and that helps to prepare them for the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6, 8.I.B.7, and 8.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- Check student vocabulary logs for accountability in recording vocabulary.

- Check gist statements to ensure students are recording quick notes about what the text is mostly about.

- Review student exit tickets after the lesson to identify common issues in analyzing point of view to use as teaching points in the next lesson before students take the mid-unit assessment in Lesson 11. See the Exit Ticket: Analyze Point of View: *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 7 (example for teacher reference).

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue to use their vocabulary, gist, and point-of-view analysis skills practiced in this lesson to read and analyze chapter 8 of *Summer of the Mariposas*. Students will also participate in Part II of a Language Dive about figurative language in *Summer of the Mariposas*.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As they arrive, students complete **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 9**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

- Remind students that they have seen vocabulary in the learning targets before (e.g., *figurative*), and that they learned about types of figurative language in the last lesson. Review simile and metaphor in preparation for Work Time A, and ask two or three students to find and share examples of these in the text.

For Heavier Support

N/A

Work Time

A. Read *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 7 Excerpt (20 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same process as with previous lessons for students to read the excerpt of chapter 7 of ***Summer of the Mariposas***, using the **Text Guide: *Summer of the Mariposas*** **(for teacher reference)**. Instruct students to read the excerpt independently and support struggling students as needed. If students do not finish reading the chapter within the allotted reading time, distribute **Synopsis: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Chapter 7** to each student to review the key details from the chapter. Then have students identify the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary, add words to the **chart paper of Spanish words**, reflect on their reading as they choose, and record the gist on **sticky notes** using the following resources as appropriate: **vocabulary logs** and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Gist: The sisters stay with the dead man’s wife and find out that they are in the news headlines.

- Stop on page 105, and focus students on the question in their Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 9, using total participation techniques (cold call, equity sticks) to select students to share their responses with the whole group. Refer to **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 9 (answers for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What is the tone of these sentences? How is Odilia feeling about the cake? How do you know?” (Student responses will vary, but may include the following: Odilia is feeling very excited and enthusiastic about eating the food. We know because she describes it in detail.)

“Which of the words on the list has the *connotation* (an idea or feeling that a word invokes in addition to its literal or primary meaning) of being exciting and enthusiastic?” (Scrumptious.)

- With students’ support, record the meaning of *connotation* on the **academic word wall**, with translations in students’ home languages. Write synonyms or sketch a visual above the word to scaffold students’ understanding. Invite students to record this word in their vocabulary logs.

- Follow the steps from previous lessons to read and reflect on the chapter.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

B. Language Dive Part I: *Summer of the Mariposas*, Page 110 – RL.8.4 (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can determine the meaning of figurative language in *Summer of the Mariposas*.”

- Tell students they will now participate in Part I of a two-part Language Dive to explore language structure used with figurative language and the relationships between words in sentences.

- Reread aloud page 110 of *Summer of the Mariposas*.

- Focus students on the sentence:

“Pita was all bug-eyed and big-eared, nodding like a *ratoncita*, nervous as a little mouse sitting on the edge of a wooden trap.”

- Use the **Language Dive Guide: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Page 110** to guide students through a Language Dive conversation about the sentence. Distribute and display the **Language Dive: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Page 110 note-catcher** and the **Language Dive: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Page 110 sentence chunk strips.**

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- Before beginning Work Time B, provide a list of translations of key vocabulary from the Language Dive sentence (e.g., *nodding*, *precariously*, *wooden*, *trap*) in students’ home languages to bypass any confusion vocabulary may cause and maintain a focus on structure and figures of speech.

Closing and Assessment

A. Exit Ticket: Analyze Point of View: *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 7 – RL.8.6 (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can explain what effect is created by differences in the points of view of the characters and the reader in chapter 7 of *Summer of the Mariposas*.”

- Remind students of the definitions and content already recorded on the **Analyze Point of View anchor chart**. Display and distribute **Exit Ticket: Analyze Point of View: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Chapter 7**, and read the questions aloud. Invite students to respond to the questions on their own and submit.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

- Collect exit tickets as students leave.

Homework

A. Connotations

- Using **Homework: Unfamiliar Vocabulary and Connotations: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Chapter 7,** students answer a combination of selected response and short constructed response questions requiring them to distinguish among the connotations of words with similar definitions.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students should preread chapter 8 of *Summer of the Mariposas* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.
