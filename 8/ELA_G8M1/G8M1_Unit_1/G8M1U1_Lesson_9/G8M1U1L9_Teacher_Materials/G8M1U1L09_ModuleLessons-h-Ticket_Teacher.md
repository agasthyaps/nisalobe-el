Sample student response:  
Amusement: “Look at their eyes. They look like cats.”

**Part D**

How does the author use narrator’s point of view to create the effect in this scene? Use details from the text to support your response. (RL.8.6)

Sample student response: Through first person point of view, only the narrator and reader know that the earrings are magical; the way the women react to the earrings is amusing. The reader feels similar feelings to the narrator because we are seeing the story through her eyes, so as she experiences amusement and relief, we do, too.
