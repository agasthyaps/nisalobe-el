(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

Pita was all bug-eyed and big-eared, **nodding like a *ratoncita,*** nervous as a little mouse sitting precariously on the edge of a wooden trap. (from page 110 of *Summer of the Mariposas* by Guadalupe Garcia McCall)

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentences help to address the daily learning target and RL.8.4, L.8.5a, and L.8.5b by presenting opportunities for students to explore the use of figurative language, how the meaning of words is constructed through relationships between words, and how word choice impacts tone.

- Supporting Standards: SL.8.1.

- Guiding Question: The sentence helps students respond to the guiding question by highlighting how figurative language is used in a modern narrative that incorporates traditional mythology into its story.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses figurative language and compelling word choice with the purpose of conveying nuanced meaning and tone. Invite students to discuss each chunk briefly, but encourage extended conversation and practice with the focus structure: **nodding like a *ratoncita***. Based on student need and time, consider adding days for extended conversation, and practice with the structure **nervous as a little mouse**.

- Practice and Transfer: After discussing the focus structure, students practice using it to discuss something in their lives. Students transfer their understanding of the meaning and structure of this sentence when interpreting meaning in a text and during the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment.

- Delivery: Note that this Language Dive should be delivered over two days in Lessons 9 and 10.

**Time**

Allocate 10 minutes for Day 1 and 10 minutes for Day 2.

Throughout the Language Dive

Focus students’ attention using colored markers on figurative language and the structure of similes, as noted, in each chunk.

Encourage rich conversation among students about the meaning of each of the sentence chunk strips, what the academic phrases within each chunk mean, and how they relate to the sentence and the text overall. Monitor and guide conversation with total participation techniques and Conversation Cues.

After asking questions, provide students up to 1 minute of think time to reflect, depending on the complexity of the question. Alternatively, invite partners to discuss, providing an allocated time for each student.

Record and display student responses next to or underneath the target language for visual reference.

Although students should briefly discuss all chunks in each Language Dive sentence, invite them to slow down during one chunk, called the focus structure, to investigate and practice a particularly compelling language structure.

Where possible, consider placing sketches, pictures, or illustrations above key nouns and verbs in the chunks after discussing their meanings. This allows students to quickly access the content of each chunk as they work with the structures in the sentence as a whole.

For translation work, invite students to use their online or paper translation dictionary if necessary. Invite students to add new vocabulary to their vocabulary logs.

Note: Some responses to questions in the Language Dive indicate only that “Responses will vary.” Like one the larger goals of Language Dives, “Responses will vary” is intended to suggest that students should be encouraged to grapple with questions and ideas, develop interest and participation, and not be immediately steered toward “correct” responses. Indeed, even where correct responses are provided, consider continuing to invite a culture of inquiry and grappling.

**Key**

Green

Launch

- Welcome students to their second Grade 8 Language Dive. Display the term **Language Dive**.

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partner.

- Say:

“Based on your first Language Dive, what do you think a Language Dive is?” (Responses will vary.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- If productive, cue students to clarify the conversation by confirming what they mean. If necessary, prompt students’ responses with sentence frames: “Yes, you’ve got it” or “No, sorry, that’s not what I mean. What I mean is \_\_\_\_\_.” Say:

“So, do you mean \_\_\_\_\_?” (Responses will vary.)

- Confirm or amend and display students’ ideas.

- Tell students this is the first day of a two-day Language Dive and that they will begin today and complete the Language Dive in the next lesson.

Deconstruct

- Remind students about the first step in the Deconstruct stage:

“When we do a Language Dive, first we read the sentence. We talk about what we think it means and how it might help us understand our guiding question.”

- Invite students to put their finger by this sentence from *Summer of the Mariposas* on their note-catchers: **Pita was all bug-eyed and big-eared, <u>nodding like a *ratoncita*</u>, nervous as a little mouse sitting precariously on the edge of a wooden trap.**

- Read aloud the sentence twice, and then ask students to take turns reading the sentence aloud with their partners.

- Say:

“What does this sentence mean to you?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“How does this sentence add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

Deconstruct (Unfamiliar Language)

- If necessary, follow a process similar to the one below for each key word in the sentence that is unfamiliar to students. Avoid too much preteaching; rely on discussing unfamiliar language in the context of each chunk going forward.

- Tell students that understanding some key, unfamiliar language before analyzing each chunk can help them prepare to focus on the meaning and importance of each chunk as a whole.

- Say:

“There are some words and phrases in this sentence that you might not know: ratoncita, precariously.”

“Place your finger on the word precariously. Does anyone know the meaning of precariously? What makes you think so? Does anyone know a translation for precariously in our home languages?” (Dangerous has a similar meaning as precarious. These are adjectives. We know that precariously is an adverb because it ends in -ly. Let’s add -ly to dangerous; dangerously is another way to say precariously.)

“Place your finger on the word ratoncita. Does anyone know the meaning of this Spanish word, ratoncita?” (Ratoncita means little female mouse and can also be used to describe a thief.)

- Consider asking students to share a translation of the word or phrase in a home language or asking family to translate the word if the process of translation will empower the student and maintain the integrity of the content.

- Say:

“Next, we take the sentence apart, chunk by chunk. We figure out what each chunk means, and why it’s important. Let’s talk about the first chunk of this sentence.”

Pita was all bug-eyed and big-eared,

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following sentence chunk strip: **Pita was all bug-eyed and big-eared**.

- Say:

“What does this chunk tell us?” (This chunk tells us that Pita’s eyes and ears were big, which is a way of saying she was paying close attention, likely because she was shocked or nervous.)

- Tell students that movement and acting out can help them figure out the meaning of sentences and chunks.

- Say:

“This chunk is about how Pita’s body responded when she was nervous. Can you show me with your face and body how it looks to be bug-eyed or big-eared?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to open their eyes widely, as if in fear, and perhaps to cup their ears to gesture careful listening.)

“Could this be another example of figurative language?” (Yes. This is a metaphor. Pita’s eyes and ears didn’t really change physically.)

- After inviting responses, write and display student ideas.

- Say:

“Let’s talk about the second chunk.”

nodding like a *ratoncita*,

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **nodding like a *ratoncita,***

- Underline like in green, and invite students to do the same on their note-catchers. 

- Say:

“What does this chunk tell us? What, in the sentence, makes you think so?” (This chunk tells us that Pita was nodding in the same way as a ratoncita \[little mouse\]. The word like tells us this is a comparison.)

“You may recognize this kind of figurative language. This is a simile. It uses like to compare two things.”

- Tell/Remind students that movement and acting out can help them figure out the meaning of sentences and chunks. Say:

“Can you show me with your face and body how it looks to be nodding like a ratoncita?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to nod their heads softly back and forth.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Tell students they will now practice the focus structure:

“You’ve played with this chunk and figured out the meaning. Now let’s use the structure in the sentence for our own speaking and writing.”

- Display the sentence frame:

> **I was laughing like a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.** (independent clause + like + \_\_\_\_\_\_ = simile)

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use this frame to create a simile to describe the way you were laughing the last time you thought something was funny in your own words with your partners.”

- Say:

“Let’s talk about the third chunk.”

nervous as a little mouse

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **nervous as a little mouse**

- Underline as in green, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 

- Say:

“What is the meaning of this chunk?” (Pita is nervous in the same way that a little mouse is.)

“This is also a simile, just like we saw in the last chunk with like, except that this simile uses as to make a comparison.”

“So, what is as being used to compare?” (The phrases nervous and a little mouse are being compared. This tells us that a little mouse is highly nervous.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- Say:

“Why did we underline the words like and as in the chunks? Let’s think about this for a day and discuss why in our next lesson.”

“So, what are we going to think about for a day and discuss in our next lesson?” (The significance of the words like and as in these sentence chunks.)

- Congratulate students on completing Part I of the Language Dive to better understand the meaning of this sentence, how it connects to the guiding question, and how to use it in their own speaking and writing. Tell them they will continue playing with this sentence in the next lesson.

Launch Day 2

- Remind students that they started deconstructing the sentence in Lesson 9, and that today they will continue the Deconstruct stage with the final chunk of the sentence and then move on to Reconstruct and Practice.

- Invite students to read aloud together the sentence from *Summer of the Mariposas* on their note-catcher:

> **Pita was all bug-eyed and big-eared, <u>nodding like a</u> *ratoncita*, nervous as a little mouse sitting precariously on the edge of a wooden trap.**

- Say:

“Look at your note-catchers from our Lesson 9 Language Dive on this sentence. What did we already learn from looking at this sentence closely?”

“I asked you to think about something last time when we finished deconstructing the first three chunks of this sentence: Why did we underline the words like and as on your  
note-catchers?” (Because these words are used to create similes, which is a type of figurative language that uses comparisons.)

- Say:

“How has your understanding of the meaning of this sentence changed?” (Responses will vary.)

- Say:

“Let’s talk about the final chunk.”

sitting precariously on the edge of a wooden trap.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **sitting precariously on the edge of a wooden trap.**

- Remind students that highlighting language can help them notice important structures and patterns.

- Underline precariously in green, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 🖉

- Say:

“We said yesterday that precariously means dangerously. What dangerous action does precariously describe in this chunk?” (Sitting on the edge of a wooden trap.)

“Who is sitting precariously on the edge of a wooden trap?” (A little mouse \[in the third chunk\].)

- Remind students that sketching can help them figure out the meanings of sentences and chunks.

“Can you sketch sitting precariously on the edge of a wooden trap on your  
note-catcher?” 🖉

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

Pita was all bug-eyed and big-eared, nodding like a *ratoncita*, nervous as a little mouse sitting precariously on the edge of a wooden trap.

Reconstruct

- Say:

“You did well figuring out what all of the chunks mean, and why they’re important.”

- Remind students they will now go from the Deconstruct to the Reconstruct stage:

“Now that you’ve played with the chunks, let’s put them all back together again into a sentence. And let’s see how playing with the chunks adds to our understanding of the meaning of the sentence and our guiding question. Let’s see how reconstructing helps us understand how English works.”

- Point to and read the entire sentence on display: **Pita was all bug-eyed and big-eared, <u>nodding like a *ratoncita*</u>, nervous as a little mouse sitting precariously on the edge of a wooden trap.**

- Say:

“Can we put the chunks in a different order and keep the same meaning?”

- Give students time to think and discuss with their triads. After a few moments, invite a student to put the sentence chunks in a different order. Possibilities that will maintain meaning include the following:

- Pita was all bug-eyed and big-eared, nervous as a little mouse sitting precariously on the edge of a wooden trap, nodding like a *ratoncita*.

- Nodding like a *ratoncita*, Pita was all bug-eyed and big-eared, nervous as a little mouse sitting precariously on the edge of a wooden trap.

- Nervous as a little mouse sitting precariously on the edge of a wooden trap, Pita was all bug-eyed and big-eared, nodding like a *ratoncita*.

- Say:

“It looks like nervous as a little mouse has to stay right before sitting precariously on a wooden trap. Why do you think this is?” (It’s the mouse who is nervous because it is sitting on the trap. Without this information, the comparison in the simile wouldn’t make sense because mice aren’t always nervous. The mouse is nervous because it is on a mouse trap that could snap.)

“And nodding like a ratoncita has to stay next to Pita was all bug-eyed and big-eared.” (This is because this simile describes Pita. Pita is nodding like a ratoncita.”)

- Say:

“What other questions can we ask that will help us understand this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses will vary.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

Practice

- Say:

“You did well putting the chunks back together again and talking about how this Language Dive has added your understanding of the meaning of the sentence and the guiding question.”

- Remind students they will now go from the Reconstruct to the Practice stage:

“You’ve played with the sentence and figured out the meaning, and why it’s important to the guiding question. Now let’s start to use the language in the sentence for our own speaking and writing.”

- Display the sentence frames:

**I feel \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ as \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.  
**(subject + verb + adjective + as + noun phrase = simile)

**My family is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ like \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.  
**(subject + verb + adjective + like + noun phrase = simile)

**Grade 8 is as \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ as \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.  
**(subject + verb + adjective + as + noun phrase = simile)

- Tell students you will give them time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use this frame to talk about your own life, using similes, in your own words with your triad.”

- If productive, cue students to clarify their sentences by confirming what they mean:

“So, do you mean \_\_\_\_\_?” (Responses will vary. Ensure that students are using the structure meaningfully.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- Congratulate students on completing the Language Dive to better understand the meaning of this sentence, how it connects to the guiding question, and how to use it in their own speaking and writing.
