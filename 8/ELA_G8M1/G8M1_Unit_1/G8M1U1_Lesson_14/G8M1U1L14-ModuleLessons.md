Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.8.8 – Opening A: Students will generate criteria for accurately quoting from a text.

- RL.8.3 – Work Time A: Students will analyze how incidents in *Summer of the Mariposas* reveal aspects of Odilia and her sisters’ character; students will work in pairs to complete a graphic organizer.

- RL.8.1 – Work Time A: Students will use evidence to support their analysis of how incidents in *Summer of the Mariposas* reveal aspects of Odilia and her sisters’ character.

- SL.8.1 – Work Time B: Students will participate in a short discussion and reflect on this discussion in order to generate norms for discussion.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- In Work Time A, students may identify an incident in which the character’s perspective shifted and find supporting evidence.

- In Work Time B, use a rubric or point system that motivates students to use higher-order thinking during their discussion. Display an anchor chart with three or more speaking and listening skills to develop during the discussion (e.g., quoting and analyzing the text, using sentence starters, making connections to other texts or social issues, and inviting their peers to participate in the discussion).

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Previously, students analyzed how incidents in the story revealed aspects of Odilia’s character. In this lesson, students will use those same skills but will consider how each sisters’ reaction to an incident reveals their individual characters.

Support All Students

- Note that there is a differentiated version of Aspects of Character: *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 1 graphic organizer used in Work Time A in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- During Work Time B, provide students with sentence starters to help them articulate their ideas (e.g., I agree with that statement because . . . , and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, would you please clarify what you are saying so I can understand you better?). ▲

- During Work Time B, students at all levels of comprehension may identify a norm for the class discussion based on their experience as a student. Students will identify the behaviors in the role play to help them generate discussion norms. Students who thrive from kinesthetic learning have the opportunity to express their understanding and their ideas through role play. Inviting volunteers to participate in the role play is recommended. Cold-calling can cause anxiety for students.

- To support ELLs, this lesson provides further practice with analyzing the characters in *Summer of the Mariposas*, outlines discussion protocols, and invites students to contribute norms that reflect their home cultures, in preparation for the upcoming end of unit assessment.

- ELLs may find it challenging to be observed during the Fishbowl discussion. Allow ELLs to be in the role of observer during this activity to reduce anxiety and create an opportunity for productive noticing as they watch and listen to peers use language in a discussion format. ELLs may also find it challenging to work through the Aspects of Character: *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 1 graphic organizer. The Aspects of Character: *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 1 graphic organizer ▲ can be used to support students who may need additional guidance as they work through this task.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6, 8.I.B.7, and 8.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- In Work Time A, review students work on the graphic organizer.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue to analyze how incidents reveal aspects of character while looking at a new chapter.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare the following:

- Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 14

- Quoting Accurately from the Text handout (one per student)

- Preselect five students to participate in an abbreviated fishbowl discussion (located in the Classroom Protocols document on the Tools Page at http://eled.org/tools) as a demonstration for their class. Inform these students that, in class, they will have time to gather their notes and evidence to prepare for the discussion. One student may be asked to talk too much and represent a non-example of discussion. Another student may be asked to not speak at all, representing another non-example for discussion. Three students may be asked to show exemplary discussion norms. Show these students the Discussion Norms anchor chart (example for teacher reference) in order to prepare them for their demonstration.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

- Ensure there is a copy of Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 14 at each student’s workspace.

Technology and Multimedia

- In Work Time A: Students complete their note-catchers in a word-processing document, such as a Google Doc, using speech-to-text facilities activated on devices or using an app or software such as http://eled.org/0103.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.8.8 (10 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As they arrive, students complete **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 14**.

- Invite students to Turn and Talk about their answers to the entrance ticket and to share their criteria. Use this to generate the **Quote Accurately from the Text anchor chart**. See **the Quote Accurately from the Text anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**, and ensure all criteria are represented.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine to focus students on the words *quote* (to repeat a passage or information), *norms* (something that is usual or typical), *productive* (causing or providing a good result), and *discussion* (a conversation between people, often to reach an understanding), and to use a dictionary to define the words or the vocabulary strategies on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart**. With students’ support, record the meaning of *quote* on the **domain-specific word wall** and *norms*, *productive*, and *discussion* on the **academic word wall**. Invite students to record the words in their **vocabulary logs**.

Work Time

A. Analyze Aspects of Character – RL.8.3 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze how incidents in *Summer of the Mariposas* reveal aspects of the characters.”

- Distribute and display the **Aspects of Character: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Chapter 1 graphic organizer.**

- Explain to students that, in the upcoming lessons, they will continue to look at how incidents in the current chapters of *Summer of the Mariposas* reveal aspects of character. They will be looking at multiple characters for that analysis. Today, they will return to the first chapter of the book, with which they are very familiar, so that they can practice this skill with incidents they already know well.

- Explain that students will fill out a graphic organizer in order to help them analyze how events in chapter 1 of *Summer of the Mariposas* reveal aspects of Odilia and each of her sisters’ individual characters. Tell students that in the end of unit assessment in Lesson 16, they will respond to a similar prompt. Remind students that organizing their thinking on a note-catcher is a way to review what they read and deepen their understanding. For ELLs and students who require additional support, the **Aspects of Character: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Chapter 1 graphic organizer** ▲ can be used to help guide students’ thinking through modeling and gradual release.

- Read the following question aloud:

“What does the incident with the dead body reveal about Odilia and her sisters?”

- Ask:

“Based on the work we did in the previous lesson, what steps will you need to take to complete this graphic organizer?”

- Guide students through an intentional, but quick, Think-Pair-Share, ensuring that partner A and partner B both have think time, both get to say the question aloud to the other, and both have allocated time to respond and then to discuss to build deeper understanding.

- Cold-Call students to share their responses.

- Invite students to work in pairs to add details, evidence, and aspects of character to the Aspects of Character: *Summer of the Mariposas* Chapter 1 graphic organizer.

- Circulate to support students as they complete their note-catchers, reminding them to include evidence. Look for any common misconceptions to use as whole group teaching points.

For Lighter Support

- Invite students to turn to an elbow partner and paraphrase their understanding of norms in 1 minute or less. Have them share out and give them feedback on their language use and the accuracy of the paraphrase. Then, invite them to turn to their partner and summarize once again, this time in 30 seconds or less. Repeat the feedback process.

For Heavier Support

- Build in additional practice and reinforcement with quoting accurately by having students apply the criteria they generate based on the entrance ticket sentence to construct a new quote from the novel. Provide a specific page to focus students’ attention. Students can compare quotations and revise as needed using the criteria, in partners.

Work Time

B. Generate Discussion Norms – SL.8.1 (15 minutes)

- Explain to students that they’re going to observe a short discussion to help them think about possible norms for productive discussion.

- Direct students’ attention to the graphic organizer prompt, and then read it aloud:

“What does the incident with the dead body reveal about Odilia and her sisters?”

- Facilitate an abbreviated fishbowl discussion by inviting the preselected small group of students to discuss the prompt in front of the rest of the class for about 5 minutes. Students who are observing should track what they notice and wonder about the discussion.

- Invite students to share their responses to the following questions:

“What did the group do well when discussing? What should we be mindful of whenever we participate in group discussions? Why?”

- As students share, capture their responses on the **Discussion Norms anchor chart**. Refer to **Discussion Norms anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Continue having the students reflect by asking the following:

“How could the group or you have improved the discussion? Are there any norms we could add to make our collaborative discussions more effective?”

- As students share, capture their responses on the Discussion Norms anchor chart.

- Create a chart with two columns at the bottom of the Discussion Norms anchor chart, with “Cues” in one and “Responses” in the other.

- Continue having the students reflect by asking the following:

“How did the group or you encourage someone else to clarify when you didn’t understand? What questions can you ask when you don’t understand what someone is saying?”

“How did you find out more about the ideas of others? What questions can you ask when you want to find out more?”

- As students share, capture their responses in the Responses column at the bottom of the Discussion Norms anchor chart. Refer to the Discussion Norms anchor chart (example for teacher reference) as necessary.

- Continue having the students reflect by asking the following:

“How can you respond when you are asked to clarify or to elaborate an idea?”

- As students share out, capture their responses in the Responses column at the bottom of the Discussion Norms anchor chart. Refer to the Discussion Norms anchor chart (example for teacher reference) as necessary.

- Prompt students to think of ways the Discussion Norms relate to Habits of Character. Give students think time, and them direct them to Pair-Share their ideas to this question:

“How can focusing on Discussion Norms support us in becoming more ethical people?” (Using discussion norms can help us show more integrity in how we interact with one another throughout the discussion. We might focus on listening, showing more respect and compassion to one another as we are speaking and listening.)

- Explain that they’ll continue to prepare for the discussion in the next lesson, and they’ll continue to practice and build their understanding about effective discussion throughout the module.

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time B, show a video of a class engaged in a text-based discussion as a model to help students understand what they are preparing to do.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time B, provide a checklist to use during the fishbowl discussion to guide observation, and draw ELLs’ attention to the language their peers use to engage in productive discussion. Encourage students to record examples of norms that they notice and the statements or questions associated with them. The list might be presented in chart format and include items with a space for notes, as in the following example chart.

Closing and Assessment

A. Set Goals – SL.8.1 (5 minutes)

- Ask:

“What is one Discussion Norm that you think you will do quite well? What is one Discussion Norm you want to work on?”

- Guide students through an intentional, but quick, Think-Pair-Share, ensuring that partner A and partner B both have think time, both get to say the question aloud to the other, and both have allocated time to respond and then to discuss to build deeper understanding.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- Invite students to deepen their goal setting and planning around discussion norms by asking students to generate three key actions they can take to support the goals they have set for themselves. This may include things like drafting their own sentence starters or rehearsing their speaking with a partner.

Homework

A. Selected Response Questions

- Using **Homework: Selected Response Questions: Analyze Aspects of Character 2**, students answer selected response questions to analyze how incidents in *Summer of the Mariposas* reveal aspects of a character.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students should preread chapter 12 of *Summer of the Mariposas* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.
