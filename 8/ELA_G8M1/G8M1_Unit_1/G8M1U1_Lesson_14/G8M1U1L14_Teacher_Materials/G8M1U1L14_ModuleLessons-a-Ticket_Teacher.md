(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, answer the following question.

On page 297 of *Summer of the Mariposas*, it says, “Accusations roiled inside of me, swirling in my head like furling tornado clouds, until I thought I might explode if I didn’t let them out.”

This is a quote from the text. When quoting accurately from a text, what criteria should you follow?

Student answers will vary, but may include some of the following:

- Copy the exact words that are in the text.

- Give the page number that the quote is from.

- Use quotation marks (“quote”) to show the words that have come word for word from the text.

- If using “he said,” “she said,” or “it says,” for example, put a comma before the quotation marks. (On page 30 Odilia said, “Quote.”)
