Quote Accurately from the Text Anchor Chart

RL.8.1, RI.8.1

(Example for Teacher Reference)

Sometimes in writing, you will need to include a direct quote from a text.

When quoting from a text:

- **Copy the exact words that are in the text.**

- **Give the page number that the quote is from.**

- **Use quotation marks (“quote”) to show the words that have come word for word from the text.**

- **If using “he said,” “she said,” or “it says,” for example, put a comma before the quotation marks. (On page 30 Odilia said, “Quote.”)**
