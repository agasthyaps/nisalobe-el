Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RL.8.4, L.8.5 – Work Time A: Students will review figurative language. Triads are allocated a kind of figurative language with an example from *Summer of the Mariposas*, and they identify a definition for this figurative language and infer what the example means in the novel.

- RL.8.4, L.8.5 – Work Time C: Students will analyze figurative language in a sentence from page 84 of *Summer of the Mariposas*. In addition to aiding students in their analysis of figurative language, this will help prepare students to write their own narrative for their performance task.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Students may work individually or in groups to find their own example(s) of figurative language in chapter 6 of *Summer of the Mariposas* and to identify the type of figurative language and infer the meaning.

- Students could identify examples of figurative language in another text.

- Students may research the history and tradition of the *quinceañera*.

- Students may research Cerberus, the three-headed dog of Hades.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Students will have analyzed figurative language in previous grade levels, and so some of the figurative language work will be a review.

- The reading in this lesson builds on the previous lessons as students continue to read *Summer of the Mariposas*, identify the gist of each chapter, and record new vocabulary in their vocabulary logs. They deepen their understanding of word meanings by identifying examples where language has a figurative, rather than a literal, meaning.

Support All Students

- When grouping students in triads to analyze figurative language in Work Time A, group ELLs with partners who have more advanced or native language proficiency. The partners with greater language proficiency can serve as a model, initiating discussions and providing implicit sentence frames, for example. Use the same triad grouping as in Lessons 4–7 if this grouping was successful. This will support students in building trust and becoming more comfortable and confident with their peers. ▲

- Note that there is a differentiated version of the Analyze Figurative Language note-catcher used in Work Time. ▲

- In Work Time B, provide choice in how to carry out the reading portion of the lesson: some students may prefer to read independently and silently, while others (especially ELLs) may wish to read aloud in groups with peers and/or with support. Still others may wish to read silently for a few pages and then process with a group. This format of choice could potentially be built into the reading time within each lesson. ▲

- As in previous lessons, in Work Time B, present additional options for recording gist rather than just the sticky note, such as using a separate notebook, using a graphic organizer, using highlighters and annotating, or using a voice recorder. Give students options for expressing their understanding of gist (oral, written, drawing). Also, build in different options for expressing comprehension of the text (written reflection, voice recording, discussion with partners/groups). ▲

- Note that chapter 6 of *Summer of the Mariposas* brings up potentially sensitive topics such as abandonment and estrangement as the girls find the family of the dead man only to learn that he abandoned them years ago. As this may be an emotional topic for some students, allow for time to process and respond to these topics during discussion, and reach out to families as needed.

- To support ELLs, this lesson presents figurative language devices using a scaffolded graphic organizer, and then students apply this new knowledge directly to reading *Summer of the Mariposas*. Building vocabulary knowledge through the use of vocabulary logs and applying strategies to determine the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary supports ELLs in their ongoing English language development.

- ELLs may find it difficult to comprehend figurative language and require extra support in determining connotation and nuance. Students who need heavier support may have trouble verbalizing their work during Work Time A. Help them identify key elements of their Analyze Figurative Language note-catcher, and allow them to repeat words and phrases.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6, 8.I.B.7, and 8.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- As students analyze figurative language in triads and then in larger groups in Work Time A, circulate to listen for misconceptions. Once complete, review students’ Analyze Figurative Language note-catcher to ensure they are on the right track for defining and analyzing each literary device.

- Check student vocabulary logs for accountability in recording vocabulary.

- Check gist statements to ensure students are recording quick notes about what the text is mostly about.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will read chapter 7 of *Summer of the Mariposas* and determine the gist of the chapter. Students will analyze the figurative language and point of view in this chapter.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As they arrive, students complete **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 8.**

- Once all students are ready, invite them to share their responses. Confirm the definition of the word *inconspicuously* to be “not readily noticeable” and that the phrases “away from the lights” and “the dimness of the night hid us” helped in understanding the meaning of the word.

- Add any relevant notes to the vocabulary strategies on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart.**

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine to focus students on the word *figurative* (a word or phrase that has a deeper meaning than its basic meaning; not literal) and to use a dictionary to define the word or the vocabulary strategies on the Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart. With students’ support, record the meaning of the word on the **domain-specific word wall**. Invite students to record the word in their **vocabulary logs**.

Work Time

A. Review Figurative Language – RL.8.4 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can determine the meaning of figurative language in *Summer of the Mariposas*.”

- Invite students to get back in their triads from Lessons 4, 6, and 7. Display and distribute the **Analyze Figurative Language note-catcher**. Read through the types of figurative language in the first column. Remind students that many of these types of figurative language will be familiar to them from work in previous grades.

- Tell students that the purpose of the note-catcher is to help them track their learning about figurative language in the text. For ELLs and students who require additional support, **Analyze Figurative Language note-catcher** ▲ can be used to help guide students’ thinking by reducing linguistic barriers related to reading fluency and speed, as well as writing, so that students can focus on the concept of figurative language.

- Use **Analyze Figurative Language note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** and a **dictionary** to do a think-aloud to model how to complete the empty columns on the chart for *simile* (a comparison of two unlike things using *like* or *as*). Record *simile* on the domain-specific word wall. Invite students to record this word in their vocabulary logs.

- Allocate each triad one of the types of figurative language, apart from *simile*. Invite triads to complete the empty columns for the figurative language they have been allocated.

- Circulate to identify any misconceptions, referring to Analyze Figurative Language note-catcher (example for teacher reference).

- After 5 minutes, refocus the group. Invite students to silently get into new groups with each type of figurative language represented. Give the students representing each type of figure 1 minute to share their definition and inference, and invite the other students to fill in the gaps on their Analyze Figurative Language note-catcher. For example, instruct students who investigated *metaphor* to have a minute to share.

- Again circulate to identify any misconceptions, referring to Analyze Figurative Language note-catcher (example for teacher reference).

- With students’ support, record the meanings of vocabulary words in the Language Dive (*metaphor* —a comparison of two unlike things; *personification* —giving an inanimate object human-like characteristics; *imagery* —language that creates a mental image for the reader, using sensory descriptions; *hyperbole* —use of exaggeration to emphasize a point; *pun* —a play on words based on two words that are close in sound but different in meaning; *verbal irony* —using language that means the opposite of what you mean for humor or dramatic effect) on the domain-specific word wall, with translations in students’ home languages. Write synonyms or sketch a visual above each key term to scaffold students’ understanding. Invite students to record these words in their vocabulary logs.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time A, invite ELLs to share examples of figurative language from their home languages and explain the meaning to the class (in English). Thinking about figurative language in home languages helps students focus on underlying concepts and supports an inclusive learning environment that honors and respects cultural diversity.

For Heavier Support

- Before Work Time A, cut the inferences in the Inference column of the Analyze Figurative Language note-catcher (for teacher reference) into strips. During the activity, have students match each inference with the appropriate text-based example of figurative language and use a glue stick to add it to the note-catcher. This allows students to produce written explanations of the inferences without processing interference so they can focus on thinking about the figurative language concepts. After students have matched the inferences with the examples, invite them to first read the inference aloud and then explain the meaning in their own words to a partner. This reinforces concepts while also supporting language development.

Work Time

B. Read *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 6 Excerpt (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same process as with previous lessons for students to read the excerpt of chapter 6 of ***Summer of the Mariposas***, using the **Text Guide: *Summer of the Mariposas*** **(for teacher reference)**. Instruct students to read the excerpt independently and support struggling students as needed. If students do not finish reading the chapter within the allotted reading time, distribute **Synopsis: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Chapter 6** to each student to review the key details from the chapter. Then have students identify the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary, add words to the **chart paper of Spanish words**, reflect on their reading as they choose, and record the gist on **sticky notes** using the following resources as appropriate: vocabulary logs and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Gist: The Garza girls take the drowned man to his family and struggle to deliver the news of his death.

- After reading, prompt students to think about Habits of Character that were evident in this chapter. Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“In what ways do characters show empathy to one another in chapter 6?” (La Llorona shows compassion to Odilia when she appears and checks in with her, providing encouragement and direction so Odilia can continue to lead her sisters.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

C. Figurative Language: *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 6 Excerpt – RL.8.4 (5 minutes)

- Invite students to turn to page 84, on which Odilia asks an elderly man sweeping the storehouse porch if he knows where the drowned dead man lives. Direct students to read along silently the elderly man’s response:

“He’s a good for nothing. *Un vago*. But that’s none of my business—flour from a different sack, as far as I’m concerned.”

- Think-Pair-Share:

“The elderly man says ‘flour from a different sack.’ Which example of figurative language did the elderly man use? Why do you think he expressed his thoughts and feelings in this way? What do you think is the deeper meaning of his statement?” (Student responses will vary, but may include the following: The elderly man uses a metaphor. He compares two unlike things—the dead man and a sack of flour. The man is sweeping a storehouse, so he may have used this comparison because he sells flour. The man is saying that if we as people were all flour, the dead man would not be in the same sack as the rest of us. He does not have the same morals as most people. Most people are not as lazy and selfish as the drowned dead man.)

- Invite volunteers to share their analysis with the whole class. Be sure to check that students are on track and are jotting down their responses and their peers’ responses to the prompt.

- If productive, use a Goal 1 Conversation Cue to encourage students to expand their ideas by giving examples.

“Can you say more about that?”

“Can you give an example?”

Closing and Assessment

A. Reflect on Learning Targets (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

- Incorporate reflection on and awareness of the following academic mindsets: “I belong in this academic community,” and “This work has value for me.”

- Ask students to Turn and Talk:

“How did you contribute to this learning community today? How were the tasks you completed valuable to you?” (Possible responses: I shared my ideas with my classmate and helped him/her to understand something new. I will have a better understanding of figurative language in texts that I read, which will help me to get more out of the story.)

Homework

A. Determine the Meaning of Figurative Language

- Using **Homework: Unfamiliar Vocabulary and Figurative Language: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Chapter 6**, students answer a combination of selected response and short constructed response questions that ask them to determine the meaning of figurative language.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students should preread chapter 7 of *Summer of the Mariposas* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.
