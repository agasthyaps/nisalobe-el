Analyze Figurative Language Note-Catcher

RL.8.4

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Read the literary device, fill in the definition, and see the example of the literary device from *Summer of the Mariposas*. Work with a partner or your group to infer the deeper meaning of each example. Record your response in the far-right column.

**Figurative Language: language used to convey something that is different from the literal definition (the definition you might find in a dictionary)**

**Add the following definitions of literary devices to the appropriate row in the charts on the following pages:**

- language that creates a mental image for the reader, using sensory descriptions

- a comparison of two unlike things

- using language that means the opposite of what you mean for humor or dramatic effect

- giving an inanimate object human-like characteristics

- use of exaggeration to emphasize a point

- a comparison of two unlike things using like or as

- a play on words based on two words that are close in sound but different in meaning

Responses will vary. Sample responses are given below.
