**Directions:** As you enter class, answer the following questions.

“Even though I had put on the earring, I refused to admit that I was seriously considering taking the body back home to his wife and kids, it was **unfathomable**. *This is stupid*, I kept telling myself.” (60)

From the context, what do you think **unfathomable** means?

unfathomable: not able to be imagined or comprehended

How did you come up with that definition? What clues did the context give you?

Student responses will vary, but may include the following: the way she says she “refused to admit” and called the situation “stupid” are the kind of things you say to yourself when a situation is unbelievable, so *unbelievable* works there.

unbelievable
