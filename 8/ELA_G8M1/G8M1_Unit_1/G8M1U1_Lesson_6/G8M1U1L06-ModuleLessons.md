Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RL.8.4, L.8.4 – Opening A: Students will determine the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary.

- RI.8.10 – Work Time B: Students will choose independent research reading texts, which are texts on the topic. See Independent Reading Sample Plans (see the Tools page at http://eled.org/tools) for ideas on how to launch independent reading. If using already established routines for launching independent reading, in this lesson students will choose a research reading text. The research reading that students complete for homework helps build both their vocabulary and knowledge pertaining to *Summer of the Mariposas*, specifically of Latin American folklore. By participating in this volume of reading over time, students will develop a wide base of knowledge about the world and the words that help describe and make sense of this topic.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Students could analyze point of view in this chapter, specifically what the reader knows about Odilia’s feelings about being one of the *cinco hermanitas* on page 62 that the other characters in the story don’t know.

- Students could rewrite a short excerpt from the perspective of one of the other sisters.

- Students could also rewrite the end of the scene as if the girls had not crossed the border.

- Students may read informational texts above their grade level, including academic vocabulary.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- This work builds on the previous lessons as students continue to read the novel *Summer of the Mariposas*, using their vocabulary logs and gist note strategies to collect new vocabulary and build their comprehension of what is happening in each chapter.

Support All Students

- In Work Time A, provide choice in how to carry out the reading portion of the lesson: some students may prefer to read independently and silently, while others (especially ELLs) may wish to read aloud in groups with peers and/or with support. Still others may wish to read silently for a few pages and then process with a group. ▲

- In Work Time A, present additional options for recording gist rather than just the sticky note, such as using a separate notebook, using a graphic organizer, using highlighters and annotating, or using a voice recorder. Give students options for expressing their understanding of gist (oral, written, drawing).

- Build in different options for expressing comprehension of the text (written reflection, voice recording, discussion with partners/groups).

- Chapter 4 brings up potentially sensitive topics such as the Garza sisters illegally crossing the Mexican border with a dead body and tricking the border patrol by using the magic of an amulet to cast a spell and invoke the mother goddess. The girls also begin to worry that their mother may be investigated by Child Protective Services due to their absence. As this may be scary or emotional for some students, or some students and their families may find this topic to be in conflict with their religious views, allow for time to process and respond to these topics during discussion, and reach out to families as needed.

- To support ELLs, this lesson builds vocabulary and knowledge of Latin American folklore through reading *Summer of the Mariposas*. Independent research reading is also introduced in this lesson, which is another opportunity for ELLs to improve reading comprehension, fluency, and vocabulary knowledge.

- ELLs may find it challenging to carry out Independent Research Reading at home, particularly if in-class reading time has included read-alouds or been done in small groups and with heavy support in Lessons 1-5. Make copies of Independent Research Reading texts in students’ home languages available in the classroom to lend to students and families.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6, 8.I.B.7, and 8.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- Review student gist statements to identify any common issues to use as teaching points. Review vocabulary logs to hold students accountable for recording new vocabulary as they read.

Down the Road

- Students will continue research reading for homework throughout the rest of the unit.

- In the next lesson, students will continue the work from the beginning of the unit analyzing the effect of the differences in point of view between the reader and the characters in preparation for the mid-unit assessment.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RL.8.4 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 6** (see In Advance). Once all students are ready, invite them to share a suggested meaning for the word *unfathomable* (not able to be imagined or comprehended). Turn and Talk:

“How did you come up with that definition? What clues did the context give you?” (Student responses will vary, but may include the following: the way she says she “refused to admit” and called the situation “stupid” are the kind of things you say to yourself when a situation is unbelievable, so *unbelievable* works there.)

“What words could you replace it with to have a similar meaning?” (*Unbelievable*.)

- Invite a student to guide the class through checking the definition in a dictionary, and invite a student to add the word and definition to the **domain-specific word wall**, with translations in home languages where appropriate (not able to be imagined or comprehended).

- Add any relevant notes to the vocabulary strategies on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart.**

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 4 Excerpt (20 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same process as with previous lessons for students to read chapter 4 of ***Summer of the Mariposas***, using the **Text Guide: *Summer of the Mariposas*** **(for teacher reference**). Instruct students to read the chapter independently and support struggling students as needed. If students do not finish reading the chapter within the allotted reading time, distribute **Synopsis: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Chapter 4** to each student to review the key details from the chapter. Then have students identify the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary, add words to the **chart paper of Spanish words**, reflect on their reading as they choose, and record the gist on **sticky notes** using the following resources as appropriate: **vocabulary logs** and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart.**

- Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol: Conduct two or three rounds of this protocol after students have recorded their gist on sticky notes. In each round, prompt students to share their gist with a new partner.

- In the last round of the protocol, ask students to share an example of empathy they saw a character exhibit in chapter 4. Direct students to the Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart for reference. (Example of empathy in chapter 4: Odilia shows compassion for her sisters when she decides to believe in the cinco hermanitas and their mission. Instead of fighting or resisting them, she becomes their leader.)

- Gist: The Garza sisters getting into Mexico without border officials discovering they are transporting a corpse.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time A, invite students to sketch or act out the events in *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 4 Excerpt after reading to help with comprehension.

- Preselect texts for Independent Research Reading that are appropriate for the students’ current levels of reading proficiency.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time A, students may struggle to keep track of the multiple characters in the anchor text. Create a characterization anchor chart for each character in *Summer of the Mariposas* and track character traits and supporting evidence as they appear in the book. Also provide individual student copies, if helpful.

- Provide an audiobook, if available, for students to follow along with as they read their Independent Research Reading texts to help facilitate comprehension.

Work Time

B. Launch Independent Research Reading – RI.8.10 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can select a research reading text that I want to read.”

- Launch independent reading. There is a suggested independent reading launch in the **Independent Reading Sample Plans**.

- At the end of 5 minutes, distribute **independent reading journals**.

- Tell students they will use this journal to log their independent reading, both choice and research reading, and to answer reading prompts.

- Display the independent reading pages of the **Homework Resources (For Families)**, and focus students on the information they need to record using the example on the same page.

- Model how to log independent reading without the prompt. Explain that students will log their research reading in the front of the book and choice reading in the back. Ensure that students understand the difference between independent research reading (topical texts) and choice reading (any texts they want to read).

- Explain that they will respond to a prompt for homework in the front of their journals, and show students where to find the prompts in the Homework Resources document.

Closing and Assessment

A. Reflect on Learning Targets (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

- Incorporate reflection on and awareness of the following academic mindsets: “I can succeed at this” and “My ability and competence grow with my effort.”

- Ask students to Turn and Talk:

“What helped you to be successful at that task? How much effort did you put in on this task? How did your effort affect your learning?” (Possible responses: I was successful at that task because I focused and worked hard. I also worked and talked with my peers, which grew my learning.)

Homework

A. Determine Meanings of Unfamiliar Words and Phrases

- Using **Homework: Unfamiliar Vocabulary: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Chapter 4**, students answer a combination of selected response and short constructed response questions that ask them to determine the meanings of unfamiliar words and phrases.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their independent reading journal.

C. Preread Anchor Text

- Students should preread chapter 5 of *Summer of the Mariposas* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.
