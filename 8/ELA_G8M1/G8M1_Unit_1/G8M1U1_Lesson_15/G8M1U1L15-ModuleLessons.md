Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RL.8.3 – Work Time B: Students will complete a graphic organizer analyzing aspects of character in chapter 12.

- RL.8.1 – Work Time B: Students will use evidence to support their analysis of aspects of character in chapter 12.

- SL.8.1 – Work Time C: Students will participate in a text-based discussion following discussion norms.

- SL.8.1 – Closing and Assessment A: Students will provide feedback to a partner based on discussion norms.

- In this lesson, the Habits of Character focus is on working to become an ethical person. The characteristics that students practice are respect, empathy, and compassion as they participate in a text-based discussion, and integrity as they work independently on a graphic organizer.

- In this lesson students will also participate in a new protocol (instructions for which appear at the first point of use in the lesson).

- **Socratic Seminar**. Socratic Seminars promote thinking, meaning making, and the ability to debate, use evidence, and build on one another’s thinking. When well designed and implemented, the seminar provides an active role for every student, engages students in complex thinking about rich content, and teaches students discussion skills. When facilitating a Socratic Seminar adhere to the following:

- Select a significant piece of text or collection of short texts related to the current focus of study. This may be an excerpt from a book or an article from a magazine, journal, or newspaper. It might also be a poem, short story, or personal memoir. The text needs to be rich with possibilities for diverse points of view.

- Develop an open-ended, provocative question as the starting point for the seminar discussion. The question should be worded to elicit differing perspectives and complex thinking. Students may also generate questions to discuss.

- Have students prepare for the seminar by reading the chosen piece of text in an active manner that helps them build background knowledge for participation in the discussion. The completion of the preseminar task is the student’s “ticket” to participate in the seminar. The preseminar assignment could easily incorporate work on reading strategies. For example, students might be asked to read the article in advance and to “text-code” by underlining important information, putting question marks by segments they wonder about, and exclamation points next to parts that surprise them.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Ask students to create goals for their end of unit assessment. How might they improve based on today’s practice?

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lessons, students practiced analyzing aspects of character using a similar graphic organizer and prepared for this discussion by generating discussion norms in response to a discussion demonstration.

Support All Students

- Presenting learning targets in writing, orally, and, if possible, accompanied by symbols will help students to understand the language within them. Check for understanding of learning targets through both written and oral paraphrasing. Some students, for example, may be able to write a paraphrase of a learning target but not articulate this orally. A written paraphrase (perhaps even with illustration) can also be helpful as a fixed reference to return to. ▲

- Provide choice in how to carry out the reading portion of the lesson: some students may prefer to read independently and silently, while others may need or wish to read aloud in groups with peers and/or with support. Still others may need or wish to read silently for a few pages and then process with a group. This format of choice could potentially be built into the reading time within each lesson. ▲

- Note that there is a differentiated version of Aspects of Character: *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 12 graphic organizer used in Work Time. ▲

- Note that chapter 12 again brings up the potentially sensitive topic of the supernatural as Odilia summons Tonantzin and sings a magical song. The goddess arrives and destroys the warlock. As previously noted, supernatural content may be scary or a may be a restricted topic for some students. Allow for time to process and respond to these topics during discussion, and reach out to families as needed.

- This lesson supports ELLs with opportunities to practice their listening and speaking skills and to demonstrate their content and linguistic knowledge in a text-based discussion, more work with analyzing characters in *Summer of the Mariposas*, and exchange of peer feedback after the discussion.

- ELLs may find it challenging to exchange feedback with their peers. Emphasize that everyone is working toward different goals. Place emphasis on growth rather than relative performance, and encourage students to give positive feedback in addition to suggestions for improvement. This creates an inclusive and supportive classroom environment.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6, 8.I.B.7, and 8.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- In Work Time A, review students’ gist statements.

- In Work Time B, review students’ work on the graphic organizer.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will participate in their end of unit assessment, which mirrors all of the skills they use in this lesson.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As they arrive, students complete **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 15**.

- Invite students to Turn and Talk about their answers to the entrance ticket and to share their goals for the discussion. Prompt students to think about how focusing on their norms will support the class discussion overall.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine to focus students on the word *text-based* (found in a book or a written/digital work) and to use a dictionary to define the word or the vocabulary strategies on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart**. With students’ support, record the meaning of *text-based* on the **domain-specific word wall**. Invite students to record the word in their **vocabulary logs**.

Work Time

A. Read *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 12 Excerpt (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same process as with previous lessons for students to read chapter 12 of ***Summer of the Mariposas***, using the **Text Guide: *Summer of the Mariposas* (for teacher reference)**. Instruct students to read the chapter independently and support struggling students as needed. If students do not finish reading the chapter within the allotted reading time, distribute **Synopsis: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Chapter 12** to each student to review the key details from the chapter. Then have students identify the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary, add words to the **chart paper of Spanish words**, reflect on their reading as they choose, and record the gist on **sticky notes** using the following resources as appropriate: vocabulary logs and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Gist: Nagual tries to kill them, but they are saved by Tonantzin when they sing cave song.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- Before Work Time A, complete portions of the Aspects of Character Graphic Organizer – Chapter 12 to create an information gap activity. Prepare three different versions for the class (with varied information included on each version), and distribute at random. Allow students to mingle, asking questions about their gaps (e.g., *“What can you tell me about Odilia?”*). Encourage students to first share the information orally, then write the answers independently, and finally add their own additional information individually or in small groups to complete the organizer.

Work Time

B. Analyze Aspects of Character – RL.8.3 (10 minutes)

- Review the learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze how incidents in *Summer of the Mariposas* reveal aspects of the characters.”

- Distribute and display the **Aspects of Character: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Chapter 12 graphic organizer.**

- Explain that students will fill out a graphic organizer in order to help them analyze how events in chapter 12 of *Summer of the Mariposas* reveal aspects of Odilia’s and Juanita’s character. Tell students that in the end of unit assessment in Lesson 16, they will respond to a similar prompt. Remind students that organizing their thinking on a note-catcher is a way to review what they read and deepen their understanding. For ELLs and students who require additional support, the **Aspects of Character: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Chapter 12 graphic organizer** ▲ can be used to help guide students’ thinking through modeling and gradual release.

- Read the following question aloud:

“What does the encounter with the nagual reveal about Velia, Delia, and Pita?”

- Invite students to work in independently to add more details, evidence, and aspects of character to the Aspects of Character: *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 12 graphic organizer.

- Circulate to support students as they complete their note-catchers, reminding them to include evidence. Look for any common misconceptions to use as whole group teaching points.

- Invite students to think about ways in which the characters showed aspects of compassion, integrity, respect, or empathy as they worked to escape the nagual. Have students Pair-Share their ideas.

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time B, it may take longer for some students to process language and follow the conversation during the text-based discussion. Encourage students to speak up when they would like to hear something repeated. Display questions students can ask to regulate the pace of the conversation (e.g., *“Can you please repeat what you said?” “Can you please speak more slowly?”*).

Work Time

C. Text-Based Discussion – SL.8.1 (10 minutes)

- Review the learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

”I can come to a discussion prepared and draw on that preparation by referring to evidence on the text and topic.”

“I can follow discussion norms to have an effective text-based discussion.”

- Focus students on all of the characteristics on the Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart in preparation for working independently on Part II of the assessment. Review what each characteristic looks like and sounds like.

- Focus students on the **Discussion Norms anchor chart**, specifically on the cues and responses. Remind them that a discussion is not just about saying what they want to say. Effective participation is about listening to others and asking and answering questions to be completely clear about what others are saying and to clarify their own points.

- Facilitate a brief Socratic Seminar discussion:

- Invite students to form a circle.

- Once the seminar begins, all students should be involved and should make sure others in the group are drawn into the discussion.

- Begin the discussion with the open-ended question designed to provoke inquiry and diverse perspectives. Inner circle students may choose to move to a different question if the group agrees, or the facilitator may pose follow-up questions.

- The discussion proceeds until you call time. At that time, the group debriefs their process.

- Invite students to share their responses to the following questions:

“What does the encounter with the nagual reveal about Velia, Delia, and Pita?”

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Closing and Assessment

A. Peer Feedback – SL.8.1 (5 minutes)

- Ask:

“What is one Discussion Norm that your partner did well? What is one Discussion Norm they could work on?”

- Guide students through an intentional, but quick, Think-Pair-Share, ensuring that partner A and partner B both have think time, both get to say the question aloud to the other, and both have allocated time to respond and then to discuss to build deeper understanding.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- Provide sentence frames to help students navigate the peer feedback discussion:

- I noticed you . . .

- \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ was a really important idea to mention. Good job!

- I suggest you consider . . .

For Heavier Support

- Create a short rubric based on discussion norms that students can complete for their partner in writing before engaging in the peer feedback discussion. This will help students to process their feedback before sharing orally and to process the feedback they receive from peers both during the peer feedback exchange and afterwards, for further reflection.

Homework

A. Selected Response Questions

- Using **Homework: Selected Response Questions: Analyze Aspects of Character 3**, students answer selected response questions to analyze how incidents in *Summer of the Mariposas* reveal aspects of a character.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their independent reading journal.
