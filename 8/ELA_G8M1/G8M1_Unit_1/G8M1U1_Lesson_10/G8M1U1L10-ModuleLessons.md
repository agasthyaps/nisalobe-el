Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- This lesson is very similar in structure to Lesson 9.

- RL.8.4 – Opening A: Students will analyze allusions to other texts.

- RL.8.4, L.8.5 – Work Time A: Students will analyze literal and figurative meaning in texts through Day 2 of the two-part Language Dive begun during Lesson 9.

- RL.8.6 – Closing and Assessment A: Students will analyze point of view in the chapter. The questions on this exit ticket are similar in structure to the questions students will be asked on the mid-unit assessment in Lesson 11.

- RL.8.1 – Closing and Assessment A: Students will use strong evidence from the text to support their analysis of point of view.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Invite students to identify examples of figurative language in this chapter and to determine the type of figurative language and the meaning (L.8.5a).

- Invite students to identify places where the reader knows things the other characters don’t and to analyze the effect this has (RL.8.6).

How It Builds on Previous Work

- The Language Dive in Work Time A of this lesson is Part II of the Language Dive begun in the previous lesson. In this lesson, students continue to analyze the meaning of figurative language in chapter 7.

- The reading in this lesson builds on the previous lessons as students continue to read *Summer of the Mariposas*, identify the gist of each chapter, and record new vocabulary in their vocabulary logs.

- The point-of-view analysis in Closing and Assessment A of this lesson builds on the point-of-view analysis work students have done on previous chapters of the text and is identical in structure to the Closing and Assessment A in the previous lesson.

Support All Students

- In Work Time A, use strategic grouping during the Language Dive to form small groups of students who share the same home language, with one or more proficient native English-speaking students added to each group to create a balance and range of similar and diverse perspectives on the structure of the English language. ▲

- In Work Time B, provide choice in how to carry out the reading portion of the lesson: some students may prefer to read independently and silently, while others (especially ELLs) may wish to read aloud in groups with peers and/or with support. Still others may wish to read silently for a few pages and then process with a group. This format of choice could potentially be built into the reading time within each lesson. ▲

- Note that chapter 8 of *Summer of the Mariposas* brings up potentially sensitive topics such as the FBI, Mexican Federales, and border patrol searching for the five sisters and that both parents are now “persons of interest” as the authorities investigate. The girls discuss the crimes they have committed, such as transporting a corpse, stealing money, crossing the border without permission, and they consider whether they might be sent to “juvie.” The girls follow a stranger home and learn more on the news about how there are corrupt authorities involved in the girls’ search. The stranger, Cecilia, causes the girls to become drowsy and Odilia realizes something is wrong and calls out for the ghost, La Llorona. As these topics may be scary, restricted, or sensitive for students, allow for time to process and respond to these topics during discussion, and reach out to families as needed.

- To support ELLs, this lesson gives ELLs an in-depth look at figurative language through the second part of a two-day Language Dive. ELLs closely analyze the use of simile and metaphor in a sentence from chapter 7 of the text and practice using these devices in their own writing. Students also continue their in-class reading of the novel and their work with point of view.

- ELLs may find it challenging to navigate unfamiliar vocabulary and figurative language devices during the Language Dive. Remind them that the purpose of Language Dives is to deepen their understanding of the text and of structure in the English language and that helps to prepare them for the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6, 8.I.B.7, and 8.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- Check student vocabulary logs for accountability in recording vocabulary.

- Check gist statements to ensure students are recording quick notes about what the text is mostly about.

- Review student exit tickets after the lesson to identify common issues in analyzing point of view to use as teaching points in the next lesson before students take the mid-unit assessment in Lesson 11. See Exit Ticket: Analyze Point of View: *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 8 (example for teacher reference).

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will take their mid-unit assessment, which directly aligns to the skills they have been practicing in this lesson.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As they arrive, invite students to complete **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 10**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Language Dive Part II: *Summer of the Mariposas*, Page 110 – RL.8.4 (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can determine the meaning of figurative language in *Summer of the Mariposas*.”

- Tell students they will now participate in Part II of a two-part Language Dive to explore language structure used with figurative language.

- Reread aloud page 110 of ***Summer of the Mariposas***.

- Focus students on the sentence:

“Pita was all bug-eyed and big-eared, nodding like a *ratoncita*, nervous as a little mouse sitting on the edge of a wooden trap.”

- Use the **Language Dive Guide: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Page 110** to guide students through a Language Dive conversation about the sentence. Distribute and display the **Language Dive: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Page 110 note-catcher**, and the **Language Dive: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Page 110 sentence chunk strips.**

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- To connect and reinforce students’ work with figurative language in and similes during the Language Dive in Work Time A, provide simile sentence stems that students can use during Work Time B as they discuss La Llorona:

- La Llorona is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ like a . . .

- La Llorona is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ as . . .

Work Time

B. Read *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 8 Excerpt (25 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same process as with previous lessons for students to read the excerpt of chapter 8 of *Summer of the Mariposas*, using the **Text Guide: *Summer of the Mariposas*** **(for teacher reference)**. Instruct students to read the excerpt independently and support struggling students as needed. If students do not finish reading the chapter excerpt within the allotted reading time, distribute **Synopsis: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Chapter 8** to each student to review the key details from the chapter. Then have students identify the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary, add words to the **chart paper of Spanish words**, reflect on their reading as they choose, and record the chapter gist notes on **sticky notes** using the following resources as appropriate: **vocabulary logs** and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart.**

- Gist: The girls try to travel to the grandmother’s but encounter Cecilia, who lures them to her house and drugs them into a slumber.

- Focus students on the question in Entrance Ticket 1, Lesson 10 and use cold-calling or equity sticks to select students to share their responses with the whole group:

“La Llorona is a significant character who appears throughout *Summer of the Mariposas*. What part does she play in the novel?” (Student responses will vary, but may include the following: she usually helps Odilia and provides Odilia with guidance.)

- Tell students that the way Guadalupe Garcia McCall includes La Llorona in the novel is called an *allusion*, which is a reference to something else. Remind students of the way La Llorona’s hair was compared to the serpents on Medusa’s head, which was also an allusion. Explain that students might hear the phrase, “He/she alluded to the idea that . . . ,” which means he or she was referencing an idea. With students’ support, record the meaning of *allusion* on the **domain-specific word wall**, with translations in students’ home languages. Write synonyms or sketch a visual above each key term to scaffold students’ understanding. Invite students to record this word in their vocabulary logs.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“Given what you know about the folklore story of La Llorona from reading the novel, why do you think La Llorona is helpful in *Summer of the Mariposas* rather than scary?” (Student responses will vary, but may include McCall is trying to reveal a different side of La Llorona’s story and character.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time B, as in Lesson 3, provide students with a sentence frame to use in the Think-Pair-Share:

- I think La Llorona is helpful in *Summer of the Mariposas* rather than scary because . . .

- This not only helps ELLs navigate the discussion, but it also draws attention to the structure of statements based on questions, which is an important linguistic feature of English.

For Heavier Support

Closing and Assessment

A. Exit Ticket: Analyze Point of View: *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 8 – RL.8.6 (5 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can explain what effect is created by differences in the points of view of the characters and the reader in chapter 8 of *Summer of the Mariposas*.”

- Remind students of the definitions and content already recorded on the **Analyze Point of View anchor chart**. Display and distribute **Exit Ticket: Analyze Point of View: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Chapter 8**, and read the questions aloud. Invite students to respond to the questions on their own and submit.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

- Collect exit tickets as students leave.

For Lighter Support

- Invite a student to paraphrase the events of chapter 8 of *Summer of the Mariposas* in more comprehensible language for those who need heavier support. Students need to have a solid understanding of the events in this chapter in order to fully understand the events in chapter 9, which is the basis of content on the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment in the next lesson

For Heavier Support

- Underline key terms in the Exit ticket questions (i.e., *infer*, *effects*, *supports*, *point of view*) and review the questions together as a class before students begin responding. This will help to ensure that students clearly understand the questions so that they can focus their cognitive processing and attention on the writing they will carry out in the task.

Homework

A. Determine Meanings of Unfamiliar Words and Phrases

- Using **Homework: Figurative Language and Connotations**, students answer a combination of selected response and short constructed response questions requiring them to determine and analyze the meanings of unfamiliar words and phrases including figurative language and connotations.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students should preread chapter 9 of *Summer of the Mariposas* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.
