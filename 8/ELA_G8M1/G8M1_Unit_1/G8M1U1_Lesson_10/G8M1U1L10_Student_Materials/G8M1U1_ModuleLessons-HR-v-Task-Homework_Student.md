Homework: Figurative Language and Connotations

**Directions:** Reread each excerpt from chapter 8 of *Summer of the Mariposas*. Using strategies for determining unfamiliar vocabulary, answer the question below.

1.  Carefully read these two sentences:

“An **apprehension spread into every pore of my being**, I did the one thing I could to quiet the guilt in my mind.” (126)

“**I was very apprehensive**, I did the one thing I could to quiet the guilt in my mind.”

The sentences in bold have very similar meanings. How does the author’s choice to use the phrase “**apprehension spread into every pore of my being**” affect your understanding of the first sentence? (RL.8.4, L.8.4a, L.8.5b, L.8.5c)
