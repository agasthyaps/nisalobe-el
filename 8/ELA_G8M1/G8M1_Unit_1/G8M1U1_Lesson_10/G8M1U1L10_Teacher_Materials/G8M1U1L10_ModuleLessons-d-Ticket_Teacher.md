RL.8.1, RL.8.6

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Read chapter 8 of *Summer of the Mariposas*, then answer these questions.

Reread page 135 from “Feeling the blood rushing . . .” to “. . . I couldn’t even talk.”

**Part A**

What can the reader infer from her description that Odilia herself does not know? (RL.8.6)

Sample student response: Something in the food Cecilia is giving them is making Odilia forget important things.

**Part B**

What effect does this create? (RL.8.6)

Sample student response: Suspense. It makes the reader worry for the girls and wonder when they will realize what is happening to them.

**Part C**

Which line from the text best supports your response? (RL.8.1)

Sample student response: “. . . but my mind was suddenly blank and I couldn’t think what it was I needed to do. I couldn’t even talk.”

**Part D**

How does the author use narrator’s point of view to create the effect in this scene? Use details from the text to support your response. (RL.8.6)

Sample student response: In this scene, Odilia’s point of view is clouded by whatever she is being given. Odilia can’t clearly see what is happening to her because she has been drugged. As readers, we have a much clearer point of view. Even though Odilia herself doesn’t understand what is happening, we can infer the situation from Odilia’s thoughts and feelings. This creates suspense. We know the girls are in danger, but they do not.
