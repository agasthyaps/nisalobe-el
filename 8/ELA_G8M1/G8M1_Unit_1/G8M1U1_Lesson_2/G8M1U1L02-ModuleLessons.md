Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RL.8.4, L.8.4 – In Opening A students will be introduced to their vocabulary logs to record and acquire new vocabulary using skills that will be taught over the course of the unit and assessed on the Mid-Unit Assessment. Students will continue to practice with this vocabulary as they read in Work Time A.

- In the Opening of this lesson, students reflect on the module’s guiding questions. This is not mandatory—students share their reflections only if they want to do so. It is important to be sensitive to students’ and families’ feelings and experiences of myths, traditional stories, and their impact on culture and identity and to acknowledge that these feelings and experiences may differ greatly, from very positive to somewhat neutral to very negative. The main point students should understand by the end of this module is that family and culture shape identity.

- In class, students will only read excerpts of the anchor text rather than complete chapters to ensure sufficient time for students to think and respond to the text. Consider inviting students who would like to read the rest of the chapter to do so for homework. If you have extended time for language arts, reading the entire chapter might be an option.

- In this lesson, students focus on work to become ethical people by showing respect and empathy as they share reflections on the guiding questions in Opening A.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Have students research myths or traditional stories that may be a part of their own culture or another culture they choose to research. Students might reflect on how these stories reflect and impact culture and identity.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students were introduced to the module topic by looking at resources in the Infer the Topic protocol. In this lesson, they formally begin to explore the topic by beginning to read *Summer of the Mariposas*.

Support All Students

- Present the learning targets in writing, orally, or accompanied by symbols, and then check for understanding by giving students time both to write or sketch and to orally paraphrase these targets. ▲

- Give students time to reflect on their own understanding of what it means to be an ethical person before the discussion, in writing or with a partner.

- Provide choice in how to carry out the reading portion of the lesson: some students may prefer to read independently and silently, while others (especially ELLs) may wish to read aloud in groups with peers and/or with support. Others may wish to read silently for a few pages and then process with a group. ▲

- Present additional options for recording gist rather than just the sticky note, such as using a separate notebook, using a graphic organizer, using highlighters and annotating, or using a voice recorder. Give students options for expressing their understanding of gist (oral, written, drawing). ▲

- Build in different options for expressing comprehension of the text (written reflection, voice recording, discussion with partners/groups). ▲

- Note that chapter 1 of *Summer of the Mariposas* brings up potentially sensitive topics such as the narrator’s father abandoning his family and the narrator and her sisters discovering a dead body. Allow for time to process and respond to these topics during discussion. After reading each chapter excerpt, students have time to reflect. Monitor your students and determine whether issues are surfacing that need to be discussed in more detail as a whole group, in smaller groups, or independently. Consider reaching out to families if a particular topic is sensitive for a student.

- To support ELLs, this lesson introduces vocabulary logs, introduces the text through a whole-class read-aloud, and creates space for honoring diverse cultures and experiences, all of which supports ELLs.

- ELLs may find it challenging or intimidating to begin a new text. Before the read-aloud, remind students that their goal is to understand what the story is mostly about and that it is okay if there are parts that they don’t quite understand yet. Consider researching the countries of origin of students before the lesson to help students make connections between their cultural backgrounds and the novel’s characters’ Latin American heritage. Privately discuss the research findings with students in advance of the lesson. Ask students for permission to share with the whole class. If students give permission, share the information and invite students to share their experiences at the beginning or end of Opening B.

- Tell students:

“I searched online and found out that \_\_\_\_\_ (country), where \_\_\_\_\_ (name of student) is from, has a very important tradition of \_\_\_\_\_\_.”

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6, 8.I.B.7, and 8.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- Work Time B allows for students’ first attempt at creating a gist statement for the first chapter of their class novel. Model and scaffold this skill; students will have more opportunity to practice this independently in the coming lessons.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue to read *Summer of the Mariposas* and begin to analyze the effect point of view has on the plot and characters, and students will continue to create gist notes and utilize their vocabulary logs.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare:

- Vocabulary log (see vocabulary form)—vocabulary logs could be a notebook into which students glue vocabulary forms, or students could create vocabulary logs by making two-sided copies of vocabulary forms and putting them in a folder. Students will continue to use these logs throughout the year and will only need new ones when they have run out of space; however, to distinguish between the topics they study in each module, they will need to flag where one module ends and a new one begins. If logs are prepared for students in advance, then 5 minutes of the Opening will not need to be used for students to prepare them.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Opening C: Students log their vocabulary in an online log, for example a Google Sheet or Doc.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Launch Vocabulary Logs – RL.8.4 (5 minutes)

- Distribute **vocabulary logs**.

- If the **vocabulary forms** were printed, distribute them as a packet, or distribute a few with **glue sticks**. Guide students through the process of gluing vocabulary forms in the front of their logs.

- Invite students to read through the definitions of *academic vocabulary* and *domain-specific vocabulary* at the top of the vocabulary forms.

- Invite students to restate these definitions in their own words.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- During Opening A, in addition to modeling a vocabulary log entry, distribute a partially completed copy of the vocabulary log (two to three entries). This provides a model for the kind of information students should enter.

Opening

B. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Direct students’ attention to the posted learning targets, and select a volunteer to read them aloud:

“I can show empathy and respect as I listen to my classmates.”

“I can find the gist of the chapter 1 excerpt of *Summer of the Mariposas*.”

“I can determine the difference between academic and domain-specific vocabulary.”

- Invite students to Turn and Talk about the most important words in the learning targets and to underline or circle those words.

- Remind students that the definitions of *academic vocabulary* (words often found in informational texts on many different topics) and *domain-specific vocabulary* (words about a particular topic, such as poetry) can be found on the top of their vocabulary forms.

- Focus students on the words *gist* and *determine*. Use total participation techniques to select students to share what they think these words mean. If they don’t know the meanings, share strategies they could use to determine them (context, affixes and roots, dictionary).

- Model how to look a word up in a print or online dictionary.

- Use a sentence frame to boost confidence and encourage participation. (Example: “Another word for *gist/determine* is \_\_\_\_\_.”)

- With students’ support, record the meanings of the words on the **academic word wall**, with translations in students’ home languages (*gist* —what the text is mostly about; *determine* —to find out or establish exactly, typically as a result of research or calculation). Write synonyms or sketch a visual above each key term to scaffold students’ understanding. Prompt students to use the word in a new sentence by either writing that sentence down or thinking of that sentence silently, then sharing with a partner. ▲

- Remind students that they studied the meaning of *empathy* (the ability to understand and share the feelings of another) in the previous lesson when creating the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**. Record the meaning of *empathy* on the academic word wall.

- Model how to record these words in vocabulary logs, and invite students to follow along.

- Turn and Talk:

“What do you think you will be doing in this lesson, based on these learning targets?” (We will be listening to one another, determining what chapter 1 of our class novel is mostly about, and finding out the exact difference between vocabulary that is academic and vocabulary that is specific to the topic we are exploring.)

“Why are we doing this? How is it meaningful to you? How will it help you to be successful?” (Listening to and empathizing with others are important skills that make us better people. Being able to determine what a text is mostly about is crucial for our comprehension. Distinguishing between words can help us acquire new vocabulary and determine how and when to best use it.)

- If productive, use a Goal 1 Conversation Cue to encourage students to expand their ideas about the word *infer* by giving examples.

“Can you say more about that?”

“Can you give an example?”

Opening

C. Reflect on the Module Guiding Questions (5 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can show empathy and respect as I listen to my classmates.”

- Remind students that in the previous lesson, they were introduced to the guiding questions for the module. Invite students to reread the **Module Guiding Questions anchor chart**.

- Explain that not all students will like folklore of Latin America or will have had positive experiences with folklore or the ways in which folklore, culture, and family impact identity. Ensure students understand that it is okay to have different opinions.

- To help build trust, share a personal story regarding feelings about folklore in general, or Latin American Folklore more specifically. Alternatively, share a personal reflection on how family or culture has impacted your own identity. ▲

- Remind students that for homework, they were asked to reflect on what those guiding questions mean to them and how they feel about them.

- Focus students on the Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart, specifically, on respect and empathy and what this looks and sounds like. Allow students to reflect silently, write, or draw their interpretations of what it means to be an ethical person and to show respect and empathy.

- Invite any students who would like to do so to share their reflections with the whole group. This must be voluntary—if no one wants to share, that is okay.

For Lighter Support

- In Opening C, provide sentence stems to help guide the conversation and to help students articulate their reflections on the module guiding questions:

- I notice that . . .

- I already know about . . .

- I hope to learn more about . . .

For Heavier Support

N/A

Work Time

A. Read Aloud and Identify Vocabulary: *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 1 Excerpt – RL.8.4 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can find the gist of the chapter 1 excerpt of *Summer of the Mariposas*.”

- Invite students to retrieve ***Summer of the Mariposas***, and remind them of what they thought the text might be about.

- Read aloud the excerpt of chapter 1 as students read along silently. Refer to the **Text Guide: *Summer of the Mariposas*** **(for teacher reference)** for the excerpt, questions, and vocabulary. If students are able to read independently or in small groups, group students accordingly and set the time for them to read the excerpt.

- After 10 minutes of reading time, distribute **Synopsis: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Prologue and Chapter 1** to each student.

- Throughout the reading, students should record new words in their vocabulary logs. Students should aim to record a minimum of three new vocabulary words. Collect Spanish words encountered on **chart paper**, inviting Spanish speakers to translate the words.

- Give students 2 minutes to silently reflect on the text. Encourage them to consider how the chapter made them feel. They can write or sketch, or just sit and think.

- Direct students’ attention to the Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart, and review “respect” and “empathy” as needed.

- Introduce a new habit of character. Read aloud what it says about compassion:

“I show compassion. This means I notice when others are sad or upset and try to help them.”

- Invite students to Turn and Talk to an elbow partner:

“Using the anchor chart as a guide, what does *compassion* mean in your own words?” (Noticing how others feel and trying to help them.)

- Tell students they will now use the Think-Pair-Share protocol, and invite students to discuss their ideas with a partner:

“What does compassion look like? What might you see when someone is showing empathy to someone else?” See **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart (example for teacher reference).**

“What does compassion sound like? What might you hear when someone is showing empathy to someone else?” See Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart (example for teacher reference).

“How have you seen the Garza sisters show compassion in chapter 1 of *Summer of the Mariposas*?”

- Invite students to share out, and record ideas in the relevant column on the anchor chart. See Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart (example for teacher reference). With students’ support, record the meaning of *compassion* on the academic word wall, with translations in students’ home languages. Model how to record this word in vocabulary logs, and invite students to follow along.

- Reminding students to apply what they have learned about respect, empathy, and compassion, invite students to share their reflections on chapter 1 of *Summer of the Mariposas* if they choose. Remind students that it is okay to have different feelings and reactions in response to the reading.

- Select a page from the text, and invite students to suggest academic and domain-specific words on that page to check their understanding for these definitions.

- Model how to use a **dictionary** to confirm or adjust the correct meaning of an unknown word.

- Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets, using a checking for understanding technique—Red Light, Green Light.

- Red Light, Green Light:

- Provide students with **red, yellow, and green objects (craft sticks, poker chips, cards, etc.)**.

- When prompted to reflect on the learning target, students place the color on their desk that reflects their comfort level or readiness (red: stuck or not ready; yellow: need support soon; green: ready to move on).

- Target support for the reds first, then move on to the yellow and greens.

- Students change their colors as needed to describe their status.

- Scan student responses, and make a note of students who might need support. Check in with them moving forward.

Work Time

B. Find the Gist: *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 1 Excerpt – SL.8.1 (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can find the gist of the chapter 1 excerpt of *Summer of the Mariposas*.”

- Cold-call students to remind the class of the definition of *gist* that they recorded in their vocabulary logs and why we look for the gist of a text. (We find the gist to check our understanding and to make a note of this and be able to navigate back to key places in the text quickly.)

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What happened? What are the main events? How is the plot unfolding?” (We learn that the main character and her sisters have been abandoned by their father and have become a little wild and independent because their mother is busy working. The sisters are playing in a river when they find a dead body floating in the water. The sisters debate whether to involve the authorities or handle the situation on their own. They find that the man has money in his shoes, and he also has identification and pictures of his children. The man is from an area where the sisters’ grandmother lives, and they know their father might also be there. As they debate what to do about the dead man, Odilia, the narrator, thinks she sees a ghostly figure across the river.)

“What is the gist? What is this chapter mostly about?” (This chapter is mostly about how the sisters in the story find a dead body and argue over whether they should call the police or return the dead man to his home in Mexico.)

- If productive, use a Goal 1 Conversation Cue to encourage students to expand their ideas about the word *gist* by giving examples.

“Can you say more about that?”

“Can you give an example?”

- Invite a student to paraphrase the key points in more comprehensible language for those who need heavier support. ▲

- Model recording gist (key words, not full sentences) on a **sticky note**, and invite students to do the same, sticking them at the front of the chapter for quick reference (e.g., ch1: sisters find dead body—debate what to do). Alternatively, give students a different option for recording gist, such as writing a margin note or using a graphic organizer that they will return to in the future.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“Did the girls do the right thing? Why or why not?” (Student responses will vary, but may include the following: no, because a dead body should be left where it is found for the police to identify in case it has evidence.)

- Ensure students are made aware of the danger and consequences of this kind of action and of the appropriate action instead.

Closing and Assessment

A. Reflect on Learning Targets (5 minutes)

- Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the learning target, using a checking for understanding technique—Thumb-O-Meter. Scan student responses, and make a note of students who might need support. Check in with them moving forward.

- Focus students on the habit of working to become an ethical person practiced in this lesson. Invite students to consider examples of respect, empathy, and compassion that they saw in this lesson. Update “Looks Like” and “Sounds Like” on the anchor chart accordingly.

- Incorporate reflection on and awareness of the following academic mindsets: “I belong in this academic community,” and “This work has value for me.”

- Ask students to Turn and Talk:

“How did you contribute to this learning community today? How were the tasks you completed valuable to you?” (Possible responses: I shared my ideas with my classmate and helped him/her to understand something new. Tracking vocabulary in my vocabulary log will help me to learn new words that I can use in my writing.)

For Lighter Support

- Before modeling recording the gist of the chapter excerpt, model determining the gist of a single paragraph. Then, ask students to do so with another paragraph in pairs. This breaks down the process using smaller chunks of text to gradually introduce students to the concept of gist.

For Heavier Support

- To help ELLs recognize gist in the chapter 1 excerpt, prepare sticky notes with prewritten words or drawings based on the gists of different sections of the excerpt. After students read, they match the gists on the sticky notes with the corresponding sections.

Homework

A. Selected Response Questions

- Using **Homework: Unfamiliar Vocabulary: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Chapter 1**, students answer selected response questions about vocabulary and how the plot is unfolding in chapter 1 of *Summer of the Mariposas* in order to practice the skills of answering selected response.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students should preread chapter 2 of *Summer of the Mariposas* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.
