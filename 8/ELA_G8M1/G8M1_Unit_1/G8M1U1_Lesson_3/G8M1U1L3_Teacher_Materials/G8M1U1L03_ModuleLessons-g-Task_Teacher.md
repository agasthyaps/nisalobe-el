RL.8.1, RL.8.6

(Answers for Teacher Reference)

Read the excerpt in chapter 2 beginning at “What are you doing here?” on page 32 and ending at “. . . it’s not an emergency” on page 33.

QuickWrite to answer this question (this means write whatever comes into your head based on what you have read in the text):

**From reading this excerpt, what do you, the reader, know that Mama doesn’t know? What effect does this create?**

The reader knows that Odilia is in fact having an emergency that her mother should know about, and she is not simply being a nuisance as Mama seems to think. This creates an effect of suspense and anxiety because the reader is desperate to know what will happen next and wishes that Odilia would simply tell her mother what is going on.
