Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- In Opening A of this lesson, students complete an entrance ticket to engage them in work related to one of the targets for this lesson. Students use this entrance ticket as a way to focus; it is similar to a “Do Now” activity. This routine occurs in many lessons throughout this module and will become familiar to students. Student entrance tickets are found in the Student Workbook, and answers for teacher reference exist for each entrance ticket.

- In Opening B of this lesson, students contribute to create the Strategies to Answer Selected Response Questions anchor chart. Throughout the modules, in lessons, assessments, and homework, students answer selected response questions and therefore need to have some strategies to do so effectively.

- In Work Time A of this lesson, students read an excerpt from chapter 2 of *Summer of the Mariposas*. As they did with chapter 1 in the previous lesson, they continue to identify both new vocabulary and the gist of the chapter.

- SL.8.1 – in Work Time A, students engage in the following new protocol in this lesson (instructions for which appear at the first point of use in the lesson):

- **Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face** promotes productive and equitable conversations and provides a method for sharing information and gaining multiple perspectives on a topic through partner interaction. It can be used for reviewing and sharing academic material, as a personal “ice breaker,” or as a means of engaging in critical thinking about a topic of debate. It also has the added advantage of involving movement to appeal to kinesthetic learners.

- RL.8.6 – In Work Time B, students begin to analyze the effect created by the differences in points of view between the reader and the characters. In addition to aiding students in their analysis of the author’s use of point of view, this will also help prepare students to write their own narrative in Unit 2 of this module. Students will practice this skill independently in their exit ticket in the Closing and Assessment.

- RL.8.1 – In Work Time B, students use evidence to support their analysis of the effect created by differences in point of view between the reader and the characters.

- RL.8.6 – In Closing and Assessment A, students answer selected and constructed response questions about the effect created by the differences in points of view between the reader and the characters.

- RL.8.1 – In Closing and Assessment A, students support their selected and constructed response questions about the effect created by the differences in points of view between the reader and the characters using strong evidence.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Invite students to write about the difference in impact the first two chapters of *Summer of the Mariposas* might have if they were written from the point of view of Pita, Juanita, Mama, or another character. Students could also rewrite the chapter(s) from another perspective.

- Invite students to rewrite a small part of the chapter from their own (the reader’s) point of view and discuss how this is different from the narrator’s point of view in the story.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- The work in this lesson builds on the previous lessons as students continue reading *Summer of the Mariposas* while using their vocabulary logs and gist-note strategies to acquire new vocabulary and build their comprehension of the class novel.

Support All Students

- In Work Time A, provide choice in how to carry out the reading portion of the lesson: some students may prefer to read independently and silently, while others (especially ELLs) may wish to read aloud in groups with peers and/or with support. Still others may wish to read silently for a few pages and then process with a group. ▲

- In Work Time A, present additional options for recording gist rather than just the sticky note, such as using a separate notebook, using a graphic organizer, using highlighters and annotating, or using a voice recorder. Give students options for expressing their understanding of gist (oral, written, drawing). ▲ Build in different options for expressing comprehension of the text (written reflection, voice recording, discussion with partners/groups). ▲

- Students may struggle to keep track of the multiple characters in the anchor text. Create a characterization chart for each main character in *Summer of the Mariposas*, and track character traits and supporting evidence as they appear in the book.

- Note that chapter 2 of *Summer of the Mariposas* brings up potentially sensitive topics such as the sisters stealing their father’s car and running away from home. Allow for time to process and respond to these topics during discussion.

- To support ELLs, this lesson incorporates gist-note strategies and selected response question strategies to build comprehension. The introduction of point of view and the exploration of culture and identity in this lesson support consideration of the diverse perspectives of ELLs as they explore differing worldviews and experiences that may be directly or indirectly similar to their own.

- ELLs may find it challenging to answer selected response questions, as the wording of questions and multiple-choice answers can require significant linguistic processing. If possible, take time to help students deconstruct the meanings of questions and answers. ELLs may also need extra support in preparation for writing QuickWrite: *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 2 Excerpt. Allow time for brainstorming and planning to help students feel more confident and focused as they set out on this task.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6, 8.I.B.7, and 8.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- The assessment today is students’ first practice with analyzing the impact of different points of view. This will be somewhat scaffolded, and students will complete this more independently in coming lessons. Review student QuickWrites after the lesson to determine any common issues to use in later lessons, and review student exit tickets to determine how close students are to understanding how to answer questions related to RL.8.6.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue to focus on point of view and how it impacts the story, using the strategies introduced in this lesson.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- As students enter the classroom, invite them to respond to the questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 3.**

- Direct students’ attention to the posted learning targets, and select a volunteer to read them aloud:

“I can identify strategies to answer selected response questions. ”

“I can find the gist of chapter 2 of *Summer of the Mariposas*.”

“I can explain what effect is created by differences in the points of view of the characters and the reader in the chapter 2 excerpt of *Summer of the Mariposas*.”

- Present the learning targets in writing, orally, and accompanied by symbols, and then check for understanding by given students time both to write or sketch and to orally paraphrase these targets. ▲

- Invite students to Turn and Talk about the most important words in the learning targets and to underline or circle those words.

- Focus students on the words *strategies* and *effects* and on the phrase *point of view*. Use total participation techniques to select students to share what they think these terms mean. If they don’t know the meanings, share strategies they could use to determine them (context, affixes and roots, dictionary).

- Model using context to determine the meanings of these words. Students may also look up each term in a print or online dictionary.

- Use a sentence frame to boost confidence and encourage participation (e.g., “Another word for or way of saying *point of view* is \_\_\_\_\_”).

- If productive, use a Goal 1 Conversation Cue to encourage students to expand their ideas about the phrase *point of view* by giving examples.

“Can you say more about that?”

“Can you give an example?”

- With students’ support, record the meanings of the words and phrase on the **academic word wall**, with translations in students’ home languages (*strategies* —plans of action or policy designed to achieve a major or overall aim; *effects* —changes that are a result or consequence of an action or other cause; *point of view* —in narrative texts, the narrator’s position in relation to the story being told; it shows the opinions or feelings of the characters involved in a situation; it is the way the author allows the reader to “hear” and “see” what is happening). Write synonyms or sketch a visual above each key term to scaffold students’ understanding. ▲

- Invite students to record these words in their **vocabulary logs**. Prompt students to use the word or phrase in a new sentence by either writing that sentence down or thinking of that sentence silently, then sharing with a partner.

- Turn and Talk:

“What do you think you will be doing in this lesson based on these learning targets?” (We will be determining strategies that we can use to answer multiple choice questions, we will be reading our class novel and determining the gist while identifying new vocabulary, and then we will be analyzing the way the characters’ points of view, and the differences in our point of view, affect the story.)

“Why are we doing this? How is it meaningful to you? How will it help you to be successful?” (Similarly to yesterday, discovering new vocabulary increases our ability to use that vocabulary to communicate well. Identifying the gist of a chapter helps check our understanding and allows us to easily refer to and remember what the chapter is mostly about. Looking at a character’s point of view and how it affects the text will help us understand why the author wrote the text this way and how it impacts us as readers.)

- If productive, use a Goal 1 Conversation Cue to encourage students to expand their ideas by giving examples.

“Can you say more about that?”

“Can you give an example?”

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- During Opening A, use images to introduce point of view; display a variety of photographs of a single building, person, object, or event taken from different vantage points to help students begin to understand the concept. Invite students to consider how different visual points of view in images might be similar to point of view in a story.

Opening

B. Determine Strategies to Answer Selected Response Questions (5 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify strategies to answer selected response questions.”

- At this time, address the prompts from the entrance ticket students responded to as they entered the classroom, and ask students to Turn and Talk:

“What strategies did you use to answer this question and the selected response questions in your homework?”

- Review the answers to the selected response question from the entrance ticket and address any questions or misconceptions. Refer to **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 3 (answers for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Emphasize that students will dig more into point of view later in the lesson.

- As students share out, capture their responses on the **Strategies to Answer Selected Response Questions anchor chart.**

- Invite students to Turn and Talk to their partner, and then select students to share out:

“How did these strategies help you to better understand the text?” (Responses will vary.)

- If productive, use a Goal 1 Conversation Cue to encourage students to expand their ideas by giving examples.

“Can you say more about that?”

“Can you give an example?”

- Invite students to reflect on their ability to use strategies to answer selected response questions, using a checking for understanding technique—for example, showing thumbs-up or traffic light signal cards. Scan student responses, and make a note of students who might need support. Check in with them moving forward.

For Lighter Support

- For additional practice and reinforcement with selected response strategies in Opening B, create one or two more selected response questions on vocabulary from the learning targets (e.g., *strategies*, *effect*).

For Heavier Support

Work Time

A. Read *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 2 Excerpt – SL.8.1 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can find the gist of chapter 2 of *Summer of the Mariposas*.”

- Invite students to retrieve ***Summer of the Mariposas***, and have them look back at their chapter 1 gist notes as a reminder of what was read in the previous lesson.

- Read aloud the excerpt of chapter 2 as students read along silently. Refer to the **Text Guide: *Summer of the Mariposas*** **(for teacher reference)** for excerpt, questions, and vocabulary. If students are able to read independently or in small groups, group students accordingly and set the time for them to read the excerpt.

- After the allotted reading time, distribute **Synopsis: *Summer of the Mariposas,*** **Chapter 2** to each student.

- Throughout the reading, students should record new words in their vocabulary logs. Collect Spanish words encountered on the same **chart paper of Spanish words**, inviting Spanish speakers to translate the words.

- After reading, give students 2 minutes to silently reflect on the text. Encourage them to consider how the chapter made them feel. They can write or sketch, or just sit and think.

- Direct students’ attention to the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**, and review “respect,” “compassion,” and “empathy” as needed before inviting students to share their reflections if they choose. Remind students that it is okay to have different feelings and reactions in response to the reading.

- Guide students through an intentional Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol on the questions listed below:

- Have students find a partner (or assign partners) and stand back-to-back, being respectful of space.

- Have students wait for the question that they will be asked to discuss with their partner.

- Have students think about what they want to share and how they might best express themselves.

- When you say, “face to face,” have students turn, face their partners, and decide who will share first (if you have not indicated that a certain person should go first).

- Have students listen carefully when their partner is speaking and be sure to make eye contact.

- When given the signal, students should find a new partner (or assign a new partner), stand back to back, and wait for the new question.

- This may be repeated for as many rounds as needed or appropriate.

- Pose questions orally and/or post them on the board.

“What happened? What are the main events? How is the plot unfolding?” (We learn that Velia took the dead man’s money, and she and Delia want to use it to take the dead man home to Mexico. Odilia, on the other hand, thinks this is too dangerous and reminds the girls that they have no way to get there. Odilia feels responsible for her sisters and is worried about getting in trouble with the authorities or with her mother for even being at the swimming hole to begin with. Odilia goes to speak with her mother, but her mother will not talk to her because she is busy at work. So, Odilia makes up a plan to pretend she is going to a sleepover and then act as if she is their mother coming home from work so that the girls will not leave the house. However, the girls still attempt to leave, and, in the end, Odilia jumps in the car with them.)

“What is the gist? What is this chapter mostly about?” (This chapter is mostly about how the sisters continue to argue about what to do, and even though Odilia tries to stop them, they eventually all get in the car to drive to Mexico.)

“In what ways did characters show respect or empathy in this chapter? Did any characters face challenges in showing respect and/or empathy?” (Odilia feels responsible for her family and tries to prevent them for traveling to Mexico to return the body. She is showing empathy in her own way. On the other hand, Juanita thinks it is respectful to return the body to his family, and motivates them to do so. The sisters are challenged in their ability to understand each other’s perspectives or motives, which makes it difficult for them to show empathy for one another.)

Direct students to the Working to be Ethical People anchor chart for reference.

- If productive, use a Goal 1 Conversation Cue to encourage students to expand their ideas by giving examples.

“Can you say more about that?”

“Can you give an example?”

- Invite a student to paraphrase the key points in more comprehensible language for those who need heavier support. ▲

- Invite students to record the gist (key words, not full sentences) onto a **sticky note**, sticking it at the front of the chapter for quick reference (e.g., ch2: Odilia tries to stop them, but sisters get in car to go to Mexico). Alternatively, give students a different option for recording gist, such as writing a margin note or using a graphic organizer that they will return to in the future.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What is your point of view on this situation? Did the girls do the right thing? Why or why not?” (Student responses will vary, but may include the following: no, because stealing a car is not only against the law, but is also very dangerous.)

- Ensure students are made aware of the danger and consequences of this kind of action and of the appropriate action instead.

- Select a page from the text, and invite students to suggest academic and domain-specific words on that page to check their understanding for these definitions.

- Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target, using a checking for understanding technique—for example, showing thumbs-up or traffic light signal cards. Scan student responses, and make a note of students who might need support. Check in with them moving forward.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time A, provide sentence frames to help guide the Think-Pair-Share:

- My point of view on this situation is that . . .

- I think the girls did the right thing because . . .

- This not only helps ELLs to navigate the discussion, but also draws attention to the structure of statements based on questions, which is an important linguistic feature of English for students to be aware of.

- Distribute a list of key vocabulary that students can use in their QuickWrite: *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 2 Excerpt (e.g., *emergency*, *found a body*, *drowned*, *take it back*, *Mexico*, *sense frustration*, *problem*) to guide the exercise and spark ideas about which information to include.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time A, give students the opportunity to prepare a sticky note with key vocabulary or ideas they want to include in their responses during the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol before beginning the activity.

- In Work Time A, for classes with more than one ELL sharing the same home language, invite an ELL with strong proficiency in both English and the home language to provide an oral summary of the chapter in the home language.

Work Time

B. Analyze Point of View: *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapters 1–2 Excerpts – RL.8.6 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can explain what effect is created by differences in the points of view of the characters and the reader in the chapter 2 excerpt of *Summer of the Mariposas*.”

- Direct students’ attention to the **Analyze Point of View anchor chart**, and invite a volunteer to read the definition of *point of view* aloud. Draw connections between the selected response question asked at the beginning of the lesson and the definition on the anchor chart.

- Invite students to turn to page 32. Read aloud the excerpt beginning at “What are you doing here?” on page 32 and ending at “it’s not an emergency” on page 33 as students read along silently.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“From what point of view is this novel written? How do you know?” (First person, because the narrator says “I.”)

“Who is the narrator? Who is talking to Mama? How do you know?” (Odilia, because she is the narrator of the novel.)

- Distribute **QuickWrite: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Chapter 2**, and invite students to read the directions and prompt aloud chorally:

“From reading this excerpt, what do you, the reader, know that Mama doesn’t know? What effect does this create?”

- Using the directions on the student material, ensure students understand what a QuickWrite is, and invite them to work in pairs on their QuickWrite. Tell students that this is a first attempt at answering a question like this, so they don’t need to worry about getting everything right. This exercise is to see what they notice.

- After 5 minutes, invite students to share out their ideas with the whole group. Listen for students to explain that the reader knows that there really is an emergency because the girls found a body and want to take it back to Mexico, and it creates a sense frustration because we want Mama to listen to Odilia to help her solve this problem. See **QuickWrite: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Chapter 2 (example for teacher reference).**

- As students respond, model completing the Analyze Point of View anchor chart. See **Analyze Point of View anchor chart (example for teacher reference).**

- Read aloud as students read chorally the question on the Analyze Point of View anchor chart and then Think-Pair-Share their ideas about the answer:

“How does the author use differences in the points of view of the characters and the reader to create effects like suspense or humor?” (Using first person point of view, the author enables the reader to see some events that the other characters don’t see.)

- Record this strategy under the question on the anchor chart. See Analyze Point of View anchor chart (example for teacher reference).

- Ensure students understand that, particularly in a first person point of view narrative, by showing experiences that the narrator has that other characters haven’t had, the author can have a certain effect on the reader. Knowing things that the characters don’t yet and might never know can make the reader feel particularly anxious or amused, or even excited. Remind students that thinking about the difference in points of view between the reader and the characters may make their own narratives more interesting when they write them in Unit 2.

Closing and Assessment

A. Exit Ticket: Analyze Point of View: *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 2 Excerpt – RL.8.6 (5 minutes)

- Display and distribute the **Exit Ticket: Analyze Point of View: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Chapter 2 excerpt**, and invite students to use the Strategies to Answer Selected Response Questions anchor chart to select the appropriate responses on the exit ticket. Read aloud the responses for students who need to hear them.

- Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target, using a checking for understanding technique—Thumb-O-Meter. Scan student responses, and make a note of students who might need support. Check in with them moving forward.

- Collect exit tickets.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- Transform the Analyze Point of View anchor chart into a kinesthetic activity as students are still building their understanding of the concept of point of view. Distribute individual copies of the anchor chart to students, and copy the relevant text excerpts from chapter 2 in column one and the information in columns two and three from the answer key onto separate strips. Students can paste the descriptions into the correct part and read them aloud as they do so before coming together as a class to add information to the anchor chart on display.

Homework

A. Determine the Meaning of Unfamiliar Vocabulary

- Using **Homework: Unfamiliar Vocabulary: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Chapter 2**, students answer a combination of selected response and short constructed response questions that ask them to determine the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary and state their strategies for doing so.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students should preread chapter 3 of *Summer of the Mariposas* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.
