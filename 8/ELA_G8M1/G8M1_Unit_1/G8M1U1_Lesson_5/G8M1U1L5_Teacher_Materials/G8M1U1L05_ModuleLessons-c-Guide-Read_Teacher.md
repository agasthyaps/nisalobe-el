Close Reading Guide:  
*The Latin American Story Finder* Excerpt

RI.8.1, RI.8.2, RI.8.4, L.8.4

(For Teacher Reference)

**Purpose and Notes**

- The purpose of this close read is for students to trace the way the author develops the central idea of the article.

- In this close read, students will focus on the whole text (which has already been shortened).

- NOTE: It will probably be necessary to give students a bit of background on who Spanish colonials were and why they matter so much to Latin American history. Be sure to include the introduction of Christianity.

- Since this is the first experience in reading informational text this year, for the first two sections, students are pointed to the main idea and asked to identify key supporting subsections, then details within the subsections.

- For the last section, the article moves away from the text structure of the first sections. Since this often happens in informational text, students are focused on what subheading would appear here if there were one. This is intended to help students read informational text with an eye to the text structure.

- In terms of vocabulary, this close read focuses only on words needed to understand the main idea and details of each section. Support with definitions of additional words as needed for basic comprehension, and encourage students to use the strategies for defining unknown words that they have been practicing throughout the unit.

- Continue to use discussion protocols (e.g., Think-Pair-Share, Conversation Cues, and total participation techniques) to engage all students in collaborative discussion about the text.

<li><p>Ask students to reread the first paragraph silently.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “What does the word <strong>magical</strong> mean?” (not real, could not possibly happen)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “The author begins the article with examples of magical elements of Latin American folklore. Why do you think he does that?”</p></li>
<li><p>Focus on the last sentence in this section.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “What does <strong>timeless</strong> mean?” (going on forever, not just old or modern) “What do you think ‘key human questions’ are? What words in the text helped you figure out what ‘key human questions’ means?” (The examples given are ideas we would all recognize, no matter who we are.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “In your own words, what is the central idea of this article?” (These magical folktales help people understand the concerns they have in their own lives.)</p></li>
<li><p>Help students to notice how interesting (even ironic?) it is that something “not real” helps people understand their “real lives.”</p></li>
<li><p>“What clues helped you to identify the central idea?” (the last two sentences of the introduction)</p></li>
<li><p>Invite students to write the central idea at the top of their note-catchers.</p></li>

<td>Read paragraph 1.</td>

<li><p>Focus students on the section titled “What Is in the Tales?” Explain that they will be looking more closely at the next three paragraphs of this section of the article to analyze how the author develops the central idea that Latin American folktales help people understand the concerns they have in their own lives.</p></li>
<li><p>Invite students to reread the section heading, then the first sentence of paragraph 1 and the main idea given in the right-hand column of their note-catchers.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “How is the main idea of this section related to the heading of the section?” (The main idea answers the question in the section heading by describing what is in the tales. Specifically, it talks about how things in ordinary life came to be the way they are.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “What are some of the details or examples the author uses to support the idea that ‘folktales teach about how things came to be the way they are’?” Refer to Close Read: Excerpt from <em>The Latin American Story Finder</em> note-catcher (answers for teacher reference) for sample responses.</p></li>

<p><strong>Vocabulary</strong></p>
<ul>

<p><strong>Vocabulary</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Guide students to explain what <strong>values</strong> are. (They will probably need direct instruction on the words <strong>taboos</strong> and <strong>mores</strong>. <strong>Taboos</strong> are actions that are forbidden, must never be done. <strong>Mores</strong> are customs, or the way we are used to doing things in a culture. Giving students examples from their own lives will be helpful.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “How is the main idea of this section related to the heading of the section?” (The main idea answers the question in the section heading by describing what is in the tales. Specifically, it talks about values and taboos—what people care most about and what is forbidden.)</p></li>

Let’s reread this last paragraph.”</p></li>
