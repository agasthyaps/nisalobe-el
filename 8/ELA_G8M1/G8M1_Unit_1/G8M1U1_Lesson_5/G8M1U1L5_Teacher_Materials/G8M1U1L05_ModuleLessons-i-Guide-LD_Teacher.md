(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

As Juan Carlos Galeano writes, “Amazonian realities are still a present and active part of the lives of the non-indigenous, **who now represent the majority of the population in most cities throughout the region.”** (from page 1 of Excerpt from *The Latin American Story Finder* by S.B. Elswit)

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps to address the daily learning target and RI.8.1, L.8.4a, and L.8.4b by focusing students’ attention on strategies for determining the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary and conventions for citing textual evidence.

- Supporting Standards: W.8.9, SL.8.1.

- Guiding Question: The sentence helps respond to the guiding question by giving students insight into the culture of Latin America.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses a relative pronoun with the purpose of adding additional information to an idea. Invite students to discuss each chunk briefly, but encourage extended conversation and practice with the focus structure: **who now represent the majority of the population in most cities throughout the region.”** Based on students’ need and time, consider adding days for extended conversation and practice with the structure **As Juan Carlos Galeano writes,.**

- Practice and Transfer: After discussing the focus structure, students practice using it to discuss something in their lives. Students transfer their understanding of the meaning and structure of this sentence when determining the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary, when determining the meanings of relative pronouns and clauses using context, when citing evidence from a text, and during the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment.

**Time**

10 minutes

Throughout the Language Dive

Focus student attention on affixes with a colored marker. One purpose of this Language Dive is to reinforce the strategy of using affixes to determine the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary, introduced in Lesson 4.

Focus student attention on the relative pronoun **who** using a blue marker. Work with relative clauses will support students in using context to determine meaning while reading texts.

Focus student attention on the word **writes** using a red marker to draw students’ attention to how writers cite sources.

Encourage rich conversation among students about the meaning of each of the sentence chunk strips, what the academic phrases within each chunk mean, and how they relate to the sentence and the text overall. Monitor and guide conversation with total participation techniques and Conversation Cues.

After asking questions, provide students up to 1 minute of think time to reflect, depending on the complexity of the question. Alternatively, invite partners to discuss, providing an allocated time for each student.

Record and display student responses next to or underneath the target language for visual reference.

Although students should briefly discuss all chunks in each Language Dive sentence, invite them to slow down during one chunk, called the focus structure, to investigate and practice a particularly compelling language structure.

Where possible, consider placing sketches, pictures, or illustrations above key nouns and verbs in the chunks after discussing their meanings. This allows students to quickly access the content of each chunk as they work with the structures in the sentence as a whole.

For translation work, invite students to use their online or paper translation dictionary if necessary. Invite students to add new vocabulary to their vocabulary logs.

Note: Some responses to questions in the Language Dive indicate only that “Responses will vary.” Like one the larger goals of Language Dives, “Responses will vary” is intended to suggest that students should be encouraged to grapple with questions and ideas, develop interest and participation, and not be immediately steered toward “correct” responses. Indeed, even where correct responses are provided, consider continuing to invite a culture of inquiry and grappling.

**Key**

Red

Blue

Launch

- Welcome students to their first Grade 8 Language Dive. Display the term **Language Dive.**

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partner. Say:

“What do you think a Language Dive is?” (Responses will vary.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- If productive, cue students to clarify the conversation by confirming what they mean. If necessary, prompt students’ responses with sentence frames: “Yes, you’ve got it” or “No, sorry, that’s not what I mean. What I mean is \_\_\_\_\_.” Say:

“So, do you mean \_\_\_\_\_?” (Responses will vary.)

- Confirm or amend and display students’ ideas.

Deconstruct

- Tell students about the first step in the Deconstruct stage:

“When we do a Language Dive, first we read the sentence. We talk about what we think it means and how it might help us understand our guiding question.”

- Invite students to put their finger by this sentence from *The Latin American Story Finder* on their note-catchers: As Juan Carlos Galeano writes, **“Amazonian realities are still a present and active part of the lives of the non-indigenous,** **<u>who now represent the majority of the population in most cities throughout the region.”</u>**

- Read aloud the sentence twice, and then ask students to take turns reading the sentence aloud with their partners.

- Say:

“What does this sentence mean to you?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“How does this sentence add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

Deconstruct (Unfamiliar Language)

- If necessary, follow a process similar to the one below for each key word in the sentence that is unfamiliar to students. Avoid too much preteaching; rely on discussing unfamiliar language in the context of each chunk going forward.

- Tell students that understanding some key, unfamiliar language before analyzing each chunk can help them prepare to focus on the meaning and importance of each chunk as a whole.

- Say:

“There are some words and phrases in this sentence that you might not know: realities, region.”

“Place your finger on the word realities. Does anyone know the meaning of realities? What makes you think so? Does anyone know a translation for realities in our home languages?” (The word realities is the plural form of reality, a word that students may be familiar with. Realities, when used in the plural form, here, refers to an individual person’s actual experience in the world; truths or experiences are other ways to say realities.)

- Consider asking students to share a translation of the word or phrase in a home language or asking family to translate the word if the process of translation will empower the student and maintain the integrity of the content.

- Say:

“Next, we take the sentence apart, chunk by chunk. We figure out what each chunk means, and why it’s important. Let’s talk about the first chunk of this sentence.”

As Juan Carlos Galeano writes,

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following sentence chunk strip: **As Juan Carlos Galeano writes,**

- Tell students that highlighting language can help them notice important structures and patterns.

- Underline writes in red, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 🖉

- Say:

“What is the meaning of this chunk?” (An author wrote something. This is a citation.)

“When do we use citations?” (Any time we are using evidence from a text to support our ideas. We need to include citations for both direct quotes and paraphrases.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- Say:

“Let’s talk about the second chunk.”

“Amazonian realities are still a present and active part of the lives of the non-indigenous,

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **“Amazonian realties are still a present and active part of the lives of the non-indigenous,**

- Underline **<u>non-</u>**, **<u>-in</u>**, and **<u>-ous</u>** in the word **<u>non-indigenous</u>**, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 🖉

- Say:

“If indigenous refers to people whose ancestors were born and have always lived in a place—like Native American tribes, the Inuit, etc., what does non-indigenous mean?” (Non-native; refers to people whose ancestors did not come from the place they now live. The affix non- means not.)

“So, the affix non- is a clue in determining the meaning of non-indigenous, but we still need to know more. I gave you the meaning of this word, but if I hadn’t, what are some other strategies you could have used to figure out the meaning of non-indigenous?” (context clues, the affixes -in and -ous, a dictionary)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- Say:

“Let’s talk about the third chunk.”

who now represent the majority of the population in most cities throughout the region.”

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: who now represent the majority of the population in most cities throughout the region.”

- Underline who in blue, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 

- Say:

“What is the meaning of this chunk?” (Most of the people who live in the Amazon are non-indigenous.)

“How do we know this is talking about the non-indigenous people?” (Because the clause that comes before it tells us. The relative pronoun who is referring back to non-indigenous in the first clause. Relative pronouns replace a word that already came at the end of the previous clause, so we can avoid repetition. The comma before who tells us this is a nonrestrictive relative clause, which means it adds extra, nonessential information that isn’t necessary for understanding who the non-indigenous are or identifying them. Rather, it tells us more about them.)

- Tell students that sketching can help them figure out the meaning of sentences and chunks.

“Can you sketch who now represent the majority of the population in most cities throughout the region on your note-catcher?” 🖉

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Tell students they will now practice the focus structure:

“You’ve played with this chunk and figured out the meaning. Now let’s use the structure in the sentence for our own speaking and writing.”

- Display the sentence frame:

> **I respect my classmates, who \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**
>
> (who + predicate = relative clause)

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use this frame to talk about your classmates in your own words with your partners.”

As Juan Carlos Galeano writes, “Amazonian realities are still a present and active part of the lives of the non-indigenous, who now represent the majority of the population in most cities throughout the region.”

Reconstruct

- Say:

“You did well figuring out what all of the chunks mean, and why they’re important.”

- Tell students they will now go from the Deconstruct to the Reconstruct stage:

“Now that you’ve played with the chunks, let’s put them all back together again into a sentence. And let’s see how playing with the chunks adds to our understanding of the meaning of the sentence and our guiding question. Let’s see how reconstructing helps us understand how English works.”

- Point to and read the entire sentence on display: **As Juan Carlos Galeano writes, “Amazonian realities are still a present and active part of the lives of the non-indigenous,** **<u>who now represent the majority of the population in most cities throughout the region.”</u>**

- Say:

“What do you notice about the underlined word who?” (It comes at the beginning of a clause, and it’s the subject of that clause. It comes after a comma. It is a relative pronoun.)

“I wonder if we can replace who with a different wh- word. Can we?” (No. Where, when, what, and why don’t make sense here because the relative pronoun who refers to non-indigenous, who are people. The word who is the pronoun we need because it refers to/replaces people.)

- If productive, cue students to expand the conversation:

“Can you say more about that?” (Responses will vary.)

- Say:

“What other questions can we ask that will help us understand this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses will vary.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

Practice

- Say:

“You did well putting the chunks back together again and talking about how this Language Dive has added your understanding of the meaning of the sentence and the guiding question.”

- Tell students they will now go from the Reconstruct to the Practice stage:

“You’ve played with the sentence and figured out the meaning, and why it’s important to the guiding question. Now let’s start to use the language in the sentence for our own speaking and writing.”

- Display the sentence frames:

> **Pita was surprised by her sister Juanita, who \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**
>
> (independent clause + relative pronoun + predicate)
>
> **The Garcia sisters didn’t know what to do when they found the man, who \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.  
> **
>
> (independent clause + relative pronoun + predicate)

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use this frame to talk about Summer of the Mariposas in your own words with your triad.”

- If productive, cue students to clarify their sentences by confirming what they mean:

“So, do you mean \_\_\_\_\_?” (Responses will vary. Ensure that students are using the structure meaningfully.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- Congratulate students on completing the Language Dive to better understand the meaning of this sentence, how it connects to the guiding question, and how to use it in their own speaking and writing.
