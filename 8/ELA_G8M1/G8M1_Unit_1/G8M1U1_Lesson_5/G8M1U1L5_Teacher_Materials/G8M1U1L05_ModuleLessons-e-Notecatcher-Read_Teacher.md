Culminating Task:** According to the author, how do magical Latin American folktales help people with the concerns they have in their own lives? With a partner, take turns orally summarizing a section of the article that you analyzed. Use the notes in the right-hand column to help you to explain the author’s main points accurately and concisely.

Sample student response:  
Latin American folktales often teach people what is important to care about in their culture, and what is forbidden. Stories tell that you will be punished if you are disrespectful to your parents. They also talk about the important value of being generous, and how it matters not to care about yourself too much by being conceited or greedy. These are ways that people learn from the magical folktales about how to understand the concerns in their own lives.
