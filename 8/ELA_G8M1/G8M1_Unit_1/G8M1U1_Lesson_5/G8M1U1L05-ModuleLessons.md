Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.8.2 – Work Time A: Students will closely read an excerpt from *The Latin American Story Finder*. This excerpt is an informational text about folklore of Latin America. Students have been introduced to La Llorona in chapter 3 of the novel *Summer of the Mariposas*, so they have a purposeful reason to begin building more knowledge about the topic. During this close read, students focus on determining a central idea, analyzing how it has been developed through the text, and writing an objective summary. The Close Reading Guide lists the text excerpts, key questions to ask students, and instructional moves required. Continue to use discussion protocols (e.g., Think-Pair-Share, Conversation Cues, and total participation techniques) to engage all students in a collaborative discussion about the text.

- RI.8.1 – Work Time A: Students will use evidence to support their work in determining a central idea, analyzing how it has been developed through the text, and writing an objective summary.

- L.8.4 – Work Time B: Students will examine the role of affixes and relationships between words in determining the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary in a Language Dive with a sentence from an excerpt from *The Latin American Story Finder*.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become ethical people by showing respect as they reflect on the content of the informational text, some of which may be familiar to students.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- The informational text makes mention of different folklore stories from Latin America. Students could research to find and read these stories.

- Students could also use the close reading note-catcher to analyze another informational text about Latin American folklore.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students have been reading *Summer of the Mariposas*, which introduces some Mexican culture and La Llorona, a figure from Latin American folklore.

Support All Students

- The Close Reading Guide is written for the text to be read aloud to students as they read along silently; however, it is important to determine how students will read the text according to their needs. Options could include the following: reading the text aloud to the class, having students read in groups/pairs, or read independently. ▲

- Note that there is a differentiated version of Close Read: *The Latin American Story Finder* Excerpt, Page 1 note-catcher ▲ used in Work Time A.

- Students may need additional support with recording their answers on their note-catchers. Seat those students in a group together for support when necessary. For ELLs and students who need additional support, use the differentiated note-catcher. ▲

- In Work Time B, use strategic grouping during the Language Dive to form small groups of students who share the same home language, with one or more proficient native English-speaking students added to each group to create a balance and range of similar and diverse perspectives on the structure of the English language. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson supports ELLs through guided work with determining the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary, a close read activity with an informational text, and a Language Dive that addresses RI.8.1 (cite evidence), as well as L.8.5 (determine the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary using context and affixes).

- ELLs may find it challenging to understand all of the information they encounter and analyze in the close reading and the Language Dive, as this will be the first time they participate in these approaches to learning. Use strategic grouping to pair ELLs with proficient and supportive peers to reduce anxiety and provide support in understanding task instructions. This also helps ELLs navigate the informational text and heavy linguistic processing during both the close read and the Language Dive.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6, 8.I.B.7, and 8.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- Invite students to share their ideas with the whole group and listen for misconceptions to address as whole group teaching points. After the lesson, review students’ Close Reading note-catchers and Language Dive note-catchers, particularly the summaries, to identify common issues to use as teaching points.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue to read *Summer of the Mariposas* to analyze point of view. Independent research reading in which students read texts on the topic is also launched in the next lesson.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students enter the classroom, invite them to respond to the questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 5.**

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine to focus students on the terms *central idea* (the main point the author wants the reader to take away from reading the text), *objective* (not influenced by personal feelings or opinions), and *summary* (a short and comprehensive statement of what has been previously stated) in the learning targets and to use a dictionary to define the word. With students’ support, record the meanings of the terms on the **academic word wall**. Invite students to record the terms in their **vocabulary logs**.

- Students may also use the vocabulary strategies on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart** to deconstruct each term and add any relevant notes to the vocabulary strategies on this chart.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- Provide resources or examples that outline common affixes in students’ home languages to build understanding of the linguistic concept of word parts, or have students generate lists of affixes with a group of students who share the same home language.

Work Time

A. Close Read: *The Latin American Story Finder* Excerpt – RI.8.2 (25 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can determine a central idea and how it is developed in an excerpt from *The Latin American Story Finder*.”

- Focus students on the Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart, and ask:

“When reading the novel so far, what routines have we been following to help us better understand the text?” (Student responses will vary, but may include the following: finding the gist, determining the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary, analyzing text in response to questions.)

- Update the Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart with student responses. See **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**.

- Move students into predetermined triads. Direct students to look at the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**, and ask them to Think-Pair-Share about a habit of character they will work toward while in triads today.

- Display and distribute ***The Latin American Story Finder*** **Excerpt**.

- Use the **Close Reading Guide: *The Latin American Story Finder*** **Excerpt** to set the purpose of the close read and to guide students through a close read of this excerpt. Refer to the guide for how to integrate the **Close Read: *The Latin American Story Finder*** **Excerpt note-catcher**.

- Tell students that the purpose of the note-catcher is to help them track the development central idea through main ideas and supporting details. Explain to students that taking notes and writing down key ideas from the text on a graphic organizer will help them to process and remember important information while they read. The note-catcher divides the text into sections to help isolate essential information. For ELLs and students who require additional support, **Close Read: *The Latin American Story Finder*** **Excerpt note-catcher** ▲ can be used to aid students’ processing and comprehension by reducing linguistic barriers through images and selected response options.

- Refer to **Close Read: *The Latin American Story Finder*** **Excerpt note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- After the close read, focus students on the Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart again, and ask:

“When reading this text, what did we do to help us better understand the text?” (Student responses will vary, but may include the following: rereading the text, digging into it more deeply through questions paragraph by paragraph.)

- Update the Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart with student responses. See Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart (example for teacher reference).

- With students’ support, record the meanings of vocabulary words in the Close Read (*originated* —started or began; *resilience* —ability to recover quickly from difficult situations; *transformed* —changed in a major way) on the academic word wall and the meaning of *values* (the ideas and ways of living that people care about, and guide how they live) on the **domain-specific word wall**, with translations in students’ home languages. Write synonyms or sketch a visual above each key term to scaffold students’ understanding. Invite students to record these words in their vocabulary logs.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time A, highlight or underline key phrases in individual copies of the informational text in advance of the close read. If time is limited, focus on vocabulary from the first sentence of each paragraph in the “What Is in the Tales?” section to aid students in understanding the most essential ideas in the text (i.e., *Latin American, tales, earthiness, fantasy, values, taboos, ancestors, spirits, resilience, economic, political, realities, indigenous*).

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time A, provide a glossary with English and/or translated definitions of key vocabulary from the first sentence of each paragraph in the “What Is in the Tales?” section to aid students in understanding the most essential ideas in the text (i.e., *Latin American, tales, earthiness, fantasy, values, taboos, ancestors, spirits, resilience, economic, political, realities, indigenous*).

Work Time

B. Language Dive: *The Latin American Story Finder* Excerpt – L.8.4 (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify strategies to determine the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary.”

- Tell students they will now participate in a Language Dive to explore language structures used in the informational text and strategies for determining the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary.

- Reread aloud the last paragraph of the excerpt from *The Latin American Story Finder*.

- Focus students on the sentence:

As Juan Carlos Galeano writes, “Amazonian realities are still a present and active part of the lives of the non-indigenous, who now represent the majority of the population in most cities throughout the region.”

- Use **Language Dive Guide: *The Latin American Story Finder*** **Excerpt, Page 1 (for teacher reference)** to guide students through a Language Dive conversation about the sentence. Distribute and display **Language Dive: *The Latin American Story Finder*** **Excerpt note-catcher, Page 1,** and **Language Dive: *The Latin American Story Finder*** **Excerpt, Page 1 sentence chunk strips**.

- With students’ support, record the meanings of vocabulary words in the Language Dive (*realities* —an individual person’s actual experience in the world; *non-indigenous* —refers to people whose ancestors did not come from the place they now live) on the domain-specific word wall, with translations in students’ home languages. Write synonyms or sketch a visual above each key term to scaffold students’ understanding. Invite students to record these words in their vocabulary logs.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Closing and Assessment

A. Make Connections between Texts (5 minutes)

- Invite students to reread the gist of each chapter they have read in *Summer of the Mariposas* so far. Think-Pair-Share:

“What connections are you making between the two texts?” (Student responses will vary, but may include the following: *Summer of the Mariposas* is about some girls who are of Latin American origin, one of whom has encountered a figure from Latin American folklore, which is what this informational text is about.)

- Ask students to reflect on the habit of character focus they set for their triad working groups. Turn and Talk:

“In what ways did you see your classmates show empathy, respect, integrity or compassion today while working in triads? How did this impact your work or progress?”

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Homework

A. Determine Meanings of Unfamiliar Words and Phrases

- Using **Homework: Unfamiliar Vocabulary: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Chapter 3 Part II**, students answer a combination of selected response and short constructed response questions that ask them to determine the meanings of unfamiliar words and phrases.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students should preread chapter 4 of *Summer of the Mariposas* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.
