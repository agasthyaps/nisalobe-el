Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Standards Being Assessed: RL.8.1, RL.8.4, RL.8.6, RL.8.10, L.8.4, L.8.5, L.8.5a, L.8.6

- Work Time B: Students will take their mid-unit assessment and will analyze and determine the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary and phrases, including figurative language and analyzing the impact of point of view within the chapter for the mid-unit assessment (RL.8.1, RL.8.4, RL.8.6, RL.8.10, L.8.4, L.8.5a, L.8.6)

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Invite students who finish the assessment early to identify other examples of figurative language in the chapter, to determine the type of figurative language, and to infer the meaning.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Throughout the first half of this unit, students have been reading *Summer of the Mariposas*, analyzing and determining the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary and phrases including figurative language and analyzing the effects of differences in point of view between the characters and the reader. This lesson continues those routines in an assessment.

Support All Students

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment.

- Some students may need the text read aloud before they work on the questions. Invite students who require this to sit in a group away from the rest of the students, so as not to be distracting.

- For some students, this assessment may require more than the 20 minutes allotted. Provide time over multiple days if necessary.

- In Chapter 9, Odilia again encounters the ghost La Llorona who reveals Cecilia to be a hag and a witch and has Odilia give her sisters something to make them throw up the potion Cecilia has fed them. La Llorona tells the girls to go to see Teresita, a seer and sorceress. As previously noted, supernatural content may be scary or a may be a restricted topic for some students. Allow for time to process and respond to these topics during discussion, and reach out to families as needed.

- This lesson supports ELLs with assessment tasks that are similar to the classroom tasks completed in Lessons 1-10. Students spend time reading and analyzing the section of the text that is used for the mid-unit assessment together during Work Time A before working independently in Work Time B to complete the assessment.

- ELLs may find it intimidating to complete the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment. The assessment places new demands on ELLs as they independently apply cognitive skills developed in Lessons 1-10 and new linguistic knowledge introduced in these lessons for the first time. Remind students of the strategies they have developed, encourage them to do their best to apply what they have learned, and assure them that they will continue learning together after the assessment.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6, 8.I.B.7, and 8.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- All assessment materials (student prompt and teacher checklist) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback on this assessment, use the answer key and sample student responses (see Assessment Overview and Resources).

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will begin to look at the themes developed in *Summer of the Mariposas* using the gist, vocabulary, and analysis skills they have already developed to begin to flesh out the deep messages within the text.

- Students’ Mid-Unit 1 Assessments will be returned in Lesson 15 with feedback.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

- To set themselves up for success for the mid-unit assessment, students need to generalize the skills that they learned from previous sessions. Activate prior knowledge by recalling the learning targets from Lessons 1–10. ▲

Work Time

A. Read *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 9 Excerpt (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same process as with previous lessons for students to read the excerpt of chapter 9 of ***Summer of the Mariposas***, using the **Text Guide: *Summer of the Mariposas*** **(for teacher reference)**. Instruct students to read the excerpt independently and support struggling students as needed. If students do not finish reading the chapter within the allotted reading time, distribute **Synopsis: *Summer of the Mariposas*** **Chapter 9** to each student to review the key details from the chapter. Then have students identify the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary, add words to the **chart paper of Spanish words**, reflect on their reading as they choose, and record the gist on **sticky notes** using the following resources as appropriate: **vocabulary logs** and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Gist: La Llorona comes to help, and the sisters flee from Cecilia, who curses them.

- Prompt students to think about the Habits of Character they read about in chapter 9. Think-Pair-Share:

“In what ways does La Llorona show empathy, compassion, integrity or respect in this chapter?”

- Refer students to the Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart as needed. (La Llorona shows compassion to Odilia when she shows her how to break the sorceress’s spell. The help she gives instills confidence and purpose in Odilia.)

Work Time

B. Mid-Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Point of View: *Summer of the Mariposas*, Chapter 9 (20 minutes)

- Distribute **Mid-Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Point of View: *Summer of the Mariposas***, **Chapter 9**.

- Tell students that for this assessment, they will analyze and determine the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary and phrases including figurative language, and they will analyze the effect of differences in points of view between the characters and the reader.

- Read aloud the directions for each part of the assessment as students follow along silently. Answer clarifying questions. Pause to have student paraphrase directions to check for understanding. ▲

- Direct students’ attention to the following resources:

- **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart**

- **Strategies to Answer Selected Response Questions anchor chart**

- **Affix list**

- Invite students to Think-Pair-Share about these support documents:

“In what ways can the Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart support you in an assessment?” (Responses will vary but could include that the anchor chart reminds us of the skills we’ve built as readers and we can apply them to an assessment.)

“What strategies do you use when you are completing selected response questions?” (Student answers will vary, but might include I think back to the text or I cross out answers that I know are incorrect.)

- Remind students to refer to these materials as they read the assessment text and answer the assessment questions.

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence.

- Invite students to begin the assessment. While they are taking the assessment, circulate to monitor and document their test-taking skills.

For Lighter Support

- Before Work Time B, underline key vocabulary in the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment directions and read aloud together as a class to ensure that students understand each task included in the assessment.

- During Work Time B, provide students with individual photocopies of anchor charts for use during the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment.

For Heavier Support

- Display a “map” of the assessment to reference while explaining directions for the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment. This will reduce ambiguity and give students a clearer picture of what they can expect, so that they can better allocate their time and attention. Provide students with colored pencils or highlighters so that they can mark up the map as needed. Example:

Part I: Selected and constructed response vocabulary questions

- Guess a word’s meaning using context.

- Determine the meaning of figurative language.

- Analyze the impact of word choice on meaning and tone.

- Guess a word’s meaning using roots and affixes.

- Clarify the implied meaning of a word.

Part II: Text-dependent questions on the author’s craft in *Summer of the Mariposas*.

- Analyze point of view.

- Consider the effects of different points of view.

- Provide evidence to support the analysis.

Closing and Assessment

A. Reflect on Learning Targets (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

- Incorporate reflection on and awareness of the following academic mindsets: “I can succeed at this” and “My ability and competence grow with my effort.”

- Ask students to Turn and Talk:

“What helped you to be successful on the mid-unit assessment? How much effort did you put in on this task? How did your effort affect your learning?” (Possible responses: I was successful at that task because I used anchor charts to help me, as needed. I also reviewed the affix list last night.)

For Lighter Support

- After the assessment, ask students to write or discuss which assessment task was easiest and which was most difficult and why. In future lessons and for homework, focus on the language skills that help students address these assessment challenges.

For Heavier Support

- Provide students with a sheet of paper on which they can use a selected a color, number, or symbol to self-assess against each learning target in private. This provides useful data for future instruction and helps students monitor their own learning.

Homework

A. Preread Anchor Text

- Students should preread chapter 10 of *Summer of the Mariposas* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.
