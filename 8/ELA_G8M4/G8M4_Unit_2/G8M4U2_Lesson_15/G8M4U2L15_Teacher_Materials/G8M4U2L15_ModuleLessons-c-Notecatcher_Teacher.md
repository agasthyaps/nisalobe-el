<td><strong><u>Some might argue</u></strong> that the film does not effectively convey Jeanne’s youthful naivete and its impact on her understanding of events.</td>
<td><p>What job is this chunk of the paragraph doing?</p>
<p><strong>(B.) It introduces an alternate claim and explains it fairly.</strong></p>
<p>Underline the first three words. Why does the chunk begin with this transition phrase?</p>
<p><strong>It signals that there is another way of thinking about this issue, which means it is about to mention an alternate claim (that the film does not effectively convey Jeanne’s youthful naivete).</strong></p></td>

<td><strong><u>Sometimes</u></strong>, the film presents scenes that depart from the text. For example, in the text, after Papa is arrested for being a traitor, Mama starts weeping uncontrollably. Jeanne starts “clinging” to her mother’s legs, “wondering why everyone was crying” (8). Jeanne’s reaction helps illustrate the significant idea that Jeanne’s youth keeps her from fully understanding what was happening to the family. In contrast, Mama cries in the film, but not uncontrollably, and Jeanne does not cling to her legs or express bewilderment at what is happening. In fact, Jeanne is not in the scene at all. <strong><u>It is true</u></strong> that the film departs from the text.</td>
<td><p>What job is this chunk of the paragraph doing?</p>
<p><strong>(D.) It acknowledges fairly the validity of the counterclaim.</strong></p>
<p>Underline the first word of the chunk and the first three words of the last sentence. Why does the writer include these transition phrases?</p>
<p><strong>They signal that the alternate claim is sometimes true.</strong></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong><u>However,</u></strong> even though this is a departure from the text, the filmmakers’ choices are effective because they show that Jeanne did not always know about the issues the family was facing. Through this film scene, the viewer can better understand that Jeanne was too young to be included in some situations and conversations about adult issues like Papa’s arrest.</td>
<td><p>What job is this chunk of the paragraph doing?</p>
<p><strong>(C.) It refutes the counterclaim by explaining its limitations, how the scene actually supports the claim.</strong></p>
<p>Underline the first word. Why does the chunk begin with this transition word?</p>
<p><strong>It shows there is going to be an exception to the alternate claim. The word <em>however</em> signals alternate information is about to be presented, and this is when the writer then fairly discusses the flaws in this claim.</strong></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>The filmmakers’ choices <u>might be somewhat</u> different from the authors’, but they honor the same significant idea of Jeanne’s youthfulness affecting how much she knew about what was happening around her.</td>
<td><p>What job is this chunk of the paragraph doing?</p>
<p><strong>(A.) It reviews the importance of the original claim.</strong></p>
<p>What do the underlined words show?</p>
<p><strong>They show that the alternate claim might be true, but the writer’s claim is stronger.</strong></p></td>
