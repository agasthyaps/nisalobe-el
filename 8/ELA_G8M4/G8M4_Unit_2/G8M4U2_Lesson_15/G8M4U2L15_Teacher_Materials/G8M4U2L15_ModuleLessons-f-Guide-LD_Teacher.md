(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

Launch

Before students begin the Language Dive, invite them to review the focus statement and main claim of Model Argument Essay: “How *Farewell to Manzanar* Conveys Jeanne’s Youth.” This will help students understand the writer’s choices in the Language Dive sentence, which connects the counterclaim in the essay (**some might argue that the film does not effectively convey Jeanne’s youthful naivete and its impact on her understanding of event**s) with the main claim (**we can see that the film *Farewell to Manzanar* effectively conveys this significant idea of Jeanne’s youth impacting her understanding of events**).

Consider using green and yellow markers to code the sentence to highlight language in the refutation that connects back to the main claim (**the filmmakers’ choices are effective**) and the information in Proof Paragraph 1 (**because they show that Jeanne does not always know about the issues the family is facing**).

However, even though this is a departure from the text,

\[subject + predicate = clause\])

- As needed, invite students to refer back to the counterclaim paragraph of the model essay to review the information in the paragraph that precedes the Language Dive sentence.

- **  
  even though**

“What are some other ways to say even though?” (although, despite the fact that, in spite of, while, notwithstanding that)

- **However,**

“What does however tell us about even though this is a departure from the text?” (that it contrasts the information that came before it in the paragraph \[adverb\])
