Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- L.8.2c – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket to practice and demonstrate their command of English spelling.

- W.8.1a – Work Time A: Students closely analyze a model counterclaim, reviewing the function of sentences and aligning them to the organizational structure of a counterclaim paragraph.

- W.8.1a – Work Time B: Students participate in a Language Dive in which they consider how a sentence distinguishes reasoning that supports the main claim from a counterclaim.

- W.8.1c – Work Time B: Students participate in a Language Dive in which they explore how transition words (*h* owever, *even* *though*) are used to connect the counterclaim and the author’s main claim in an essay.

- W.8.1a – Work Time C: Students work in pairs to draft the counterclaim of their practice essay.

- W.8.4 – Work Time C: Students work with partners to produce clear and coherent counterclaim paragraphs, anticipating questions the reader may have.

- W.8.5 – Closing and Assessment A: Students develop and strengthen writing by reading their counterclaim aloud and providing feedback to strengthen the counterclaim of their practice essay.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners, showing perseverance as they independently write.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release those students who are ready to read and analyze the model counterclaim independently and then move on to drafting the counterclaim to their practice essay with a partner.

- Challenge students to generate additional counterclaims with refutations for Model Argument Essay: “How *Farewell to Manzanar* Conveys Jeanne’s Youth” for additional practice with acknowledging conflicting viewpoints.

- Allow students to develop and craft counterclaims for other situations relevant to their life experiences inside and outside of school to practice the skill of writing counterclaims.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the second half of this unit, students have been analyzing a model and using their analysis to draft the introduction and Proof Paragraphs of their practice assay and plan these aspects of their assessment essay. This lesson continues those routines to guide students in writing and planning their Proof Paragraphs.

Support All Students

- Consider the variety of ways in which partnerships can help students to more deeply understand the genre of argument writing and successfully complete their work. Choral reading, peer planning, shared writing, shared evidence gathering, clarifying tasks, varying scribing responsibilities, editing support, etc. are all possible roles partners can play for one another in these lessons. ▲

- Students may have limited argument writing experience and be unfamiliar with strong counterclaim paragraphs, as it is a skill introduced for the first time in Grade 8. Provide students with examples and scaffolded support (sentence stems, transitional words, annotated graphic organizers, multiple models of counterclaim paragraphs and additional opportunities to talk through their ideas). ▲

- Prior to orally rehearsing their counterclaim in Work Time C, model this exchange for students. Prompt two students to orally rehearse the sentences they will use when writing to help all students gain a vision of how a rehearsal can support their writing process.

- Students may need additional support while writing their counterclaim paragraphs. Group these students for a discussion to guide them through the Model Argument Essay Counterclaim note-catcher in a step-by-step manner. ▲

- Note there is a differentiated version of the Model Argument Essay Counterclaim note-catcher used in Work Time A in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Pull small instructional groups who need more scaffolding and support and extended verbal processing time to develop their reasoning statements. ▲

- Consistently referring to the model argument essay and analyzing it carefully to see how it is structured and the tone that it uses will act as a support for students who need reminders of what strong argument writing looks like. ▲

- Providing written and verbal directions and charting the steps they will take on an anchor chart could help students as they plan for their writing. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson includes further practice with spelling, time to analyze the counterclaim paragraph of a model essay, and a Language Dive on a sentence that connects a counterclaim with a claim in the model essay. Students will have already seen this sentence in the previous lessons while reading and analyzing the model essay. In the Practice portion of this Language Dive, students begin drafting a sentence for the counterclaim paragraph of their own essays. After the Language Dive, students will directly transfer what they have learned and practiced while writing their individual argument essays.

- Students may find it difficult to understand the structure of a counterclaim paragraph and struggle to form a coherent counterclaim in their essays. Prioritize the collaborative portions of the lesson to ensure that students are receiving appropriate support and that they are able to discuss and ask questions as they become more familiar with this element of an essay. Oral rehearsal before writing may be especially beneficial for ELLs.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.C.11, 8.I.C.12, 8.II.A.1, and 8.II.A.2.

Assessment Guidance

- Use the Grade 8 Writing Process checklist to assess students’ writing abilities in Work Times A and C (see the Tools page at http://eled.org/tools).

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will write the conclusion of their practice essay. Students complete an independent argument essay during their End of Unit 3 Assessment in Lessons 18–19.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.8.2c (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **2**, **Lesson** **15**.

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique to review their responses. Refer to **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **2**, **Lesson** **15** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Analyze a Model: What Is a Counterclaim? – W.8.1a (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify the purpose of each part of the counterclaim paragraph of a model argument essay.”

- Display and instruct students to retrieve their copies of **Model** **Argument** **Essay**: “ **How** ***Farewell to Manzanar* Conveys** **Jeanne’s** **Youth**.” Tell students that they will look at an important aspect of good argument writing—including a counterclaim.

- Remind students that argument writing involves working with a question that is complicated, and that the writer needs to do a lot of thinking about both sides of an issue before making a claim that he or she thinks is the best answer to the question. Remind students that being respectful of differing positions is important.

- Remind students of all the thinking they have done about how the filmmakers’ choices convey significant ideas during Unit 1 and Unit 2 of this module.

- Explain that the writer of an argument knows that other people, who may also have thought carefully about how the film conveys the text’s significant ideas, might come to a different claim. Explain that this means that part of writing one’s own argument is to address that thinking and still develop one’s own position, which is the counterclaim.

- Direct students to look at their copy of the Model Argument Essay: “How *Farewell to Manzanar* Conveys Jeanne’s Youth.” Prompt students to put their finger on the main claim of the essay.

- Read the counterclaim aloud as students read along silently.

- Turn and Talk:

“How does including this counterclaim section make the essay stronger?” (It shows the reader that the writer has really thought about this; it shows that the writer knows deeply what he is talking about and recognizes that the issue is complicated.)

- Distribute and display the **Model** **Argument** **Essay** **Counterclaim** **note** - **catcher**. For ELLs and students who require additional support, the **Model** **Argument** **Essay** **Counterclaim** **note** - **catcher** ▲ can be used to help guide students’ thinking with matching. Refer to **Model** **Argument** **Essay** **Counterclaim** **note** - **catcher** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as needed.

- Direct students to read the first chunk of sentences from the model with their partner:

- “Some might argue that the film does not effectively convey Jeanne’s youthful naivete and its impact on her understanding of events.”

- Think aloud and discuss the role of this chunk in the counterclaim. (This section transitions from Proof Paragraph 2 and uses cuing language that an alternate claim is being introduced.) Direct students to underline the first three words in the section. (Students underline “Some might argue.”)

- Turn and Talk:

“Why does the chunk begin with this transition phrase?” (The writer is letting the reader know that they are transitioning from the main claim and will be discussing an alternate claim.)

- Continue working through each chunk of the counterclaim on the Model Argument Essay Counterclaim note-catcher, pausing to ask students to identify the job of each section of text and the purpose of the transitional words. Clarify any questions, and use any misconceptions as whole group teaching points.

- Turn and Talk:

“Why does a counterclaim exist in an argument essay, but not in other types of informative writing?” (In an argument essay, there is often more than one reasonable claim. Writers can strengthen the claim they have chosen by acknowledging alternate claims and then refuting them, because the writer is trying to convey the importance of her main claim. In other types of writing, writers are not trying to argue a point, so there is no need to counter an argument.)

“How would you describe the tone of this counterclaim? What makes you think so?” (The writer crafts a counterclaim that is respectful of other interpretations of the filmmakers’ choices. The writer also is careful not to claim too much. Using words like *sometimes, might be,* and *somewhat* helps her convey a tone of respectful consideration of other ideas, while also solidifying her own claim. All of this is important because the writer understands that there are other interpretations of the filmmakers’ choices.)

- Invite students to help record or check the parts of a counterclaim on the **Characteristics** **of** **Argument** **Writing** **anchor** **chart**. Refer to **Characteristics** **of** **Argument** **Writing** **anchor** **chart** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) and **Model** **Argument** **Essay**: “ **How** ***Farewell to Manzanar* Conveys** **Jeanne’s** **Youth** ” (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as necessary.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

N/A

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time A, invite students who need heavier support to use the Model Argument Essay Counterclaim note-catcher ▲. This resource features matching to help students analyze the role of individual sentences in the counterclaim paragraph. Working with this differentiated version of the graphic organizer will set students up for success in planning their independent essays on the End of Unit 2 Assessment.

- For further practice with the concept of a counterclaim, after the activity in Work Time A, display or distribute a list of everyday scenarios that students can come up with counterarguments against. Pair students, and have them take turns alternating between making a claim and responding to the claim with a counterclaim. Use the following situations, or create new ones:

12. One person claims a group of friends should go to the movie theater to see a new film. Another person disagrees and wants to watch an old favorite movie at home.

13. A parent wants her child to do his homework right after school. The child believes it would be best to take a break to relax and do homework after eating dinner.

14. A child is claiming that she is ready to have a smartphone and deserves one. Her parents don’t believe this is necessary, and they don’t think she is responsible enough yet.

Work Time

B. Language Dive: Model Argument Essay: “How *Farewell to Manzanar* Conveys Jeanne’s Youth,” Paragraph 4 – W.8.1a (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify the purpose of each part of the counterclaim paragraph of a model argument essay.”

- Display the **Questions** **We** **Can** **Ask** **during** **a** **Language** **Dive** **anchor** **chart**. Ensure students understand how to use these questions, pointing out that the questions underlined on the anchor chart are questions that students should always ask when they dive into a sentence.

- Tell students they will now participate in a Language Dive to explore how transition words are used to create cohesion between a counterclaim and the author’s argument in an essay.

- Reread aloud paragraph 4 of the Model Argument Essay: “How *Farewell to Manzanar* Conveys Jeanne’s Youth.”

- Focus students on the sentence:

- “However, even though this is a departure from the text, the filmmakers’ choices are effective because they show that Jeanne does not always know about the issues the family is facing.”

- Use the **Language** **Dive** **Guide**: **Model** **Argument** **Essay**: “ **How** ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **Conveys** **Jeanne’s** **Youth**,” **Paragraph** **4** (**for** **teacher** **reference**) and **Language** **Dive**: **Model** **Argument** **Essay**: “ **How** ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **Conveys** **Jeanne’s** **Youth**,” **Paragraph** **4** **Sentence** **Chunk** **Chart** to guide students through a Language Dive conversation about the sentence. Distribute and display the **Language** **Dive**: **Model** **Argument** **Essay**: “ **How** ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **Conveys** **Jeanne’s** **Youth**,” **Paragraph** **4** **note** - **catcher** and the **Language** **Dive**: **Model** **Argument** **Essay**: “ **How** ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **Conveys** **Jeanne’s** **Youth**,” **Paragraph** **4** **sentence** **chunk** **strips**. Refer to **Language** **Dive**: **Model** **Argument** **Essay**: “ **How** ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **Conveys** **Jeanne’s** **Youth**,” **Paragraph** **4** **note** - **catcher** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- To extend learning and application after the Language Dive in Work Time B, invite students to underline transition words and phrases they have used in their own practice essays in the introduction and Proof Paragraphs. Students can discuss in pairs how each transition word or phrase creates cohesion. If time allows, display examples from students’ work and discuss as a whole class. Students may then wish to add or revise transition words in their essays.

Work Time

C. Practice Essay: Rehearse and Write a Counterclaim – W.8.1a, W.8.4 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can write the counterclaim of my practice essay.”

- Discuss the following characteristic on the displayed **Argument** **Writing** **checklist**, adding to the Characteristics column as needed and answering any questions about the role of the counterclaim in an argument essay. Refer to **Argument** **Writing** **checklist** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- “W.8.1a: I fairly acknowledge claims that are different from my own and explain why my claim is still valid.”

- Prompt students to review their **Practice** **Argument** **Essay** **Writing** **Plan** **graphic** **organizer**.

- Ask:

“What are the main claim and points of the practice essay?” (Responses will vary, but may include: The main claim is that the film *Farewell to Manzanar* effectively conveys this significant idea of Papa’s painful conflicted loyalties. The two points that support this are that the filmmakers’ choices convey this idea in the scene when Papa burns the flag and the scene when Papa is interviewed at Fort Lincoln.)

“What would be a reasonable counterclaim to this claim and these points?” (Responses will vary, but may include: the film does not effectively convey the significant idea because the details differ between the film and the text versions of the flag-burning scene.)

- Instruct students to orally rehearse their counterclaim paragraph with their partners. Direct partners to use the cues located on the bottom of their Model Argument Essay Counterclaim note-catcher to formulate ideas.

- Tell students they are now ready to draft the counterclaim of their practice essay. Remind students that as they draft this counterclaim paragraph, they should strengthen their main claim by acknowledging an alternative claim, and explaining its validity, while refuting it and further elaborating on the benefits and relevance of their own claim. As necessary, review the meanings of the words *validity* and *refute* from Module 2, asking students to find the words in their **vocabulary** **logs** and on the **academic** **word** **wall**.

- Invite students to retrieve their **devices** and gather any remaining materials from the list below, and to refer to the Characteristics of Argument Writing anchor chart as they write:

- Model Argument Essay: “How *Farewell to Manzanar* Conveys Jeanne’s Youth”

- Argument Writing checklist

- **Painted** **Essay** ® **template**

- Practice Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer

- Model Argument Essay Counterclaim note-catcher

- ***Farewell to Manzanar***

- **Connections** **and** **Distinctions**: ***Farewell to Manzanar* note** - **catcher**

- **Compare** **Text** **to** **Film**: ***Farewell to Manzanar* note** - **catcher**

- **Close** **Read**: ***Farewell to Manzanar***, **Chapter** **7** **note** - **catcher**

- **Significant** **Ideas** **anchor** **chart**

- Circulate to support students as they write and to identify common issues to use as whole group teaching points.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Closing and Assessment

A. Peer Feedback: Practice Essay Counterclaim – W.8.5 (5 minutes)

- Invite students to find a partner other than their predetermined partner for their practice essay.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What does it mean to ‘fairly acknowledge claims’?” (Responses will vary, but may include: recognize that the goal of a counterclaim is not simply to explain why their idea is best, but also to fairly weigh additional ideas.)

“Why does this criterion say ‘fairly’ instead of just ‘acknowledge’ claims?” (A writer knows that those who disagree with her may still have merit to their claim, and when they address these merits, they need to use language that is respectful and fair.)

- Prompt students to read their counterclaims aloud and provide feedback to one another according to this criterion.

- “W.8.1a: I fairly acknowledge claims that are different from my own and explain why my claim is still valid.”

- Invite students to record “Y” for *Yes* and the date in the final column of their Argument Writing checklist if they feel the criteria marked on their checklists have been achieved in their writing in this lesson. Remind students to revise their counterclaim.

- As time permits, use Conversation Cues Goal 3: Help students deepen their thinking, by collecting responses from the class regarding their classmates’ ability to fairly acknowledge alternate claims and by asking questions like:

“How did your partner fairly acknowledge an alternate claim in their counterclaim?” (Responses will vary.)

“Why do you think that?” (Responses will vary.)

“What sentence in their counterclaim makes you think so?” (Responses will vary.)

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson in their work to be respectful partners, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Revise Counterclaims

- Students revise the counterclaim of their practice argument essay based on criteria and feedback.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent** **reading** **journal**.
