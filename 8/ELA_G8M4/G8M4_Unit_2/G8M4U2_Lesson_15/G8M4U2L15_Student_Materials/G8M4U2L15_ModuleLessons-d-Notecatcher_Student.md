<td>Some might argue that the film does not effectively convey Jeanne’s youthful naivete and its impact on her understanding of events.</td>

<td>Sometimes, the film presents scenes that depart from the text. For example, in the text, after Papa is arrested for being a traitor, Mama starts weeping uncontrollably. Jeanne starts “clinging” to her mother’s legs, “wondering why everyone was crying” (8). Jeanne’s reaction helps illustrate the significant idea that Jeanne’s youth keeps her from fully understanding what was happening to the family. In contrast, Mama cries in the film, but not uncontrollably, and Jeanne does not cling to her legs or express bewilderment at what is happening. In fact, Jeanne is not in the scene at all. It is true that the film departs from the text.</td>
<td><p>What job is this chunk of the paragraph doing?</p>
<p>Underline the first word of the chunk and the first three words of the last sentence. Why does the writer include these transition phrases?</p></td>

<tr class="odd">
<td>However, even though this is a departure from the text, the filmmakers’ choices are effective because they show that Jeanne did not always know about the issues the family was facing. Through this film scene, the viewer can better understand that Jeanne was too young to be included in some situations and conversations about adult issues like Papa’s arrest.</td>

<td>The filmmakers’ choices <u>might be somewhat</u> different from the authors’, but they honor the same significant idea of Jeanne’s youthfulness affecting how much she knew about what was happening around her.</td>

<p>What do the underlined words show?</p></td>
