Synopsis: *Farewell to Manzanar*, Chapter 12

**Name:** **Date:**

**Chapter 12 “Manzanar, U.S.A.”**

- Jeanne and her family move to a new part of the camp, Block 28, next to a pear orchard. They are able to move to be closer to the hospital where Mama works as a dietician.

- Jeanne sees the move as a turning point in the camp experience from “outrageous to tolerable.”

- The barracks are generally less crowded because of the loyalty oath, which sped up the relocation process for Japanese Americans.

- The family has four rooms for twelve people, which is double the size of their former living space.

- Papa is drinking less, but he still makes his own alcohol. He spends much of his time outside doing hobbies like gardening and painting with watercolors and does not have a regular job at camp.

- After being at Manzanar for years, life becomes easier and more normal for Jeanne and her family, and it starts to feel like a small town.

- Mama continues to work as a dietician, and Jeanne’s brothers and sisters keep busy with various hobbies.

- The camp has a high school yearbook called “Our World” that documents class photos, events, and daily life.
