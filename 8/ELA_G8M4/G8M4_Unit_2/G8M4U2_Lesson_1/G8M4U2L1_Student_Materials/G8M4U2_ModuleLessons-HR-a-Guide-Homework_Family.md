What were the causes and impacts of Japanese American internment camps?

- *Japanese American internment camps were ordered by President Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War II to incarcerate hundreds of thousands of Japanese Americans in the western United States. These camps were established out of fear and prejudice toward Japanese American people after the attack on Pearl Harbor.*

- *Internment camps uprooted people from their homes and communities, stripped them of their rights, confiscated their personal property, and forced them to live and work as prisoners.*

What will your student be doing at school?

In this unit, students continue to explore the topic of Japanese American internment and analyze how significant ideas from *Farewell to Manzanar* are conveyed in the film adaptation of the text. In the first half of the unit, students read part 2 of *Farewell to Manzanar* and continue to track connections and distinctions among individuals, ideas, and events in the text. Throughout the lessons, students answer selected and constructed response questions about connections and distinctions, point of view, and language to consider meaning in the text. For example, students consider how the authors use figurative language to make a connection between the narrator Jeanne Wakatsuki’s baton and her father to convey Jeanne’s anger toward her father. This work prepares students for the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment. Students also watch the third segment of the film adaptation of *Farewell to Manzanar* and continue to track the extent to which the film *Farewell to Manzanar* stays faithful to or departs from the text. For example, some scenes in the film include different dialogue, characters, or setting details.

In the second half of Unit 2, students read the final chapters of *Farewell to Manzanar* while tracking connections and distinctions in the text and finish watching the film adaptation of *Farewell to Manzanar*. For the End of Unit 2 Assessment, students choose one of the significant ideas they have identified from *Farewell to Manzanar* and write a literary argument essay to evaluate how effectively the film conveys this significant idea. In preparation for this assessment, students analyze a model, plan and draft a practice essay in partners, and plan their individual essay.

Central to the EL Education curriculum is a focus on “habits of character” and social-emotional learning. With this in mind, students work on various habits of character throughout the curriculum:

- Work to Become Effective Learners: developing mindsets and skills for success in college, career, and life (e.g., initiative, responsibility, perseverance, collaboration)

- Work to Become Ethical People: treating others well and standing up for what is right (e.g., empathy, integrity, respect, compassion)

- Work to Contribute to a Better World: putting their learning to use to improve communities (e.g., citizenship, service).

Working to become ethical people is the habit of character emphasized in this unit. These are the specific skills students will focus on:

- I show empathy. This means I understand and share or take into account the feelings, situation, or attitude of others. In this unit, students focus on showing empathy as they read and think about the challenges Japanese Americans faced before, during, and after internment.

- I show respect. This means I appreciate the abilities, qualities, and achievements of others and treat myself, others, and the environment with care. In this unit, students focus on showing respect as they read texts that bring up sensitive topics such as prejudice, incarceration, war, and death as they reflect on Japanese American internment.

- I show compassion. This means I notice when others are sad or upset and try to help them. Students work to build awareness of their peers’ emotions and reactions to the challenging and sensitive topics from Japanese American internment they are reading, thinking, talking, and writing about in this unit.

- I persevere. This means I challenge myself. When something is hard, I keep trying and ask for help if I need it. Students write literary argument essays both in pairs and independently. In order to do so, they must apply a range of knowledge and skills that they have built throughout Units 1 and 2.

- I collaborate. This means I can work well with others to get something done. Students work together in pairs to write a practice literary argument essay.

How can you support your student at home?

Talk to your student about the guiding questions, particularly if any of the topics raised might be sensitive for your student or family.

Talk to your student about the texts he or she is reading in the classroom, particularly if any of the topics raised might be sensitive for your student.

Reach out to teachers if you have any questions or concerns about the text.

Talk to your student about Japanese American internment. Discuss other examples of internment and incarceration of populations in history and in modern day.

Watch films and research on the internet with your student to find out more about Japanese American internment and World War II. Build background knowledge on this topic by discovering together the details of this time period and its lasting effects.

Read informational books and articles with your student, and discuss. What important events did you learn about? How did these events impact the individuals?

Unit 2: Homework

Students engage in two kinds of reading for homework, with choice reading as an additional option.

**Anchor text reading:** Students preread chapters of the anchor text, *Farewell to Manzanar*, to prepare for the next lesson. They also reread the chapters of the text read in class and answer questions about it.

**Independent research reading:** When not reading their anchor text, your student is expected to independently research the topic. In the first lesson, students complete both types of reading as both independent research reading and the anchor text are introduced. When not assigned readings in the anchor text, students read topic-related books of their choice for approximately 20 minutes <u>each day</u> and respond to a prompt of choice in the <u>front</u> of the independent reading journal. These are usually books your student will bring home from school; however, they may be topic-related books chosen by your student at the public or your home library. Prompts for independent reading can be found in the homework materials provided.

**Choice reading:** If your student would also like to independently read and respond to a book of free choice, he or she may use the <u>back</u> of the independent reading journal. Prompts for independent reading can be found in the homework materials provided.

Independent Reading

**Directions:** Remember to record responses to research reading in the front of your independent reading journal and responses to choice reading in the back. Try to choose a different prompt each time.

Record any new vocabulary in your vocabulary log. Underline vocabulary found during independent reading.

**Record:**

- Date

- Title and author of your reading book

- Pages you have read

- Prompt

- Response

**Example:**

<u>Date:</u> 10/13/2020

<u>Book Title and Author:</u> *Farewell to Manzanar* by Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston and James D. Houston

<u>Pages Read:</u> 120–127

<u>Prompt:</u> How does this text add to your understanding of one of the guiding questions of the module?

<u>Response:</u> This chapter of *Farewell to Manzanar* adds to my understanding of the module guiding question: “What were the causes and impacts of Japanese American internment camps?” Japanese Americans learn the news of being released from the camps, and they are concerned about what they will do when the leave. They do not have anywhere to live, and they do not have jobs. The stress they experience is an example of the impacts of Japanese American internment. Japanese Americans were uprooted from their homes when they entered internment camps, and when they return from them, they will have to start over.

**Consider using the following independent reading prompts.**[^1]

- How does this text add to your understanding of one of the guiding questions of the module?

- Which habits of character are demonstrated in the text? Explain.

- What is the central idea or theme of the text? How was this idea developed?

- Record two or three facts in your own words that you learned from the text.

- Summarize your research reading today in no more than five sentences.

- What major ideas are present in the text you read? Give text details that convey those ideas.

- What questions do you have about the topic after reading?

- Choose one new word from your reading today, and analyze it on a vocabulary square.

| **Definition in your own words**                  | **Synonyms (words with the same meaning)** |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Words with the same affix or root**             | **Sketch**                                 |
| **Translation in home language** (if appropriate) |                                            |

Vocabulary

**Directions:** In the classroom, you have been recording words from your texts in your vocabulary log. Throughout this unit, you have been research reading topic-related books at home to build your knowledge of Japanese American internment and recording words in your independent reading journal.

Choose a word from your research reading or from a text you’ve read in class, and add the word to your vocabulary log. Try to choose a different word to add and to practice a different vocabulary strategy each time. For each word, be sure to add the following:

1.  The definition, or meaning, of the word

<!-- -->

3.  The vocabulary strategy you used to figure out the meaning of the word

4.  A sketch or diagram that helps you to better understand the meaning of the word

Record new vocabulary in your vocabulary log, and mark academic vocabulary with a symbol, for example, a star:

- Academic vocabulary: words you might find in informational texts on many different topics. For example, the words *evidence* and *rationale* are words that could be found in books on any topic.

- Domain-specific vocabulary: words about a particular topic. For example, the words *tadpoles*, *frogspawn*, and *amphibian* are some that would be found on the topic of frogs.

**Vocabulary Strategies**

As a reminder, the vocabulary strategies we’ve been working on in class are listed below:

- Context: read the sentence around the word.

- Look at the affixes for clues.

- Look at the root of the word for clues.

- Use a dictionary.

- Discuss the word with another person (after attempting some of the above strategies).

[^1]: Some of the prompts will not be appropriate for the text students are reading. Invite students to choose a prompt that works for the text they have just read.
