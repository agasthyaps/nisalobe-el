**Part C**

Based on your understanding of the excerpt, what does this connection convey about Jeanne’s point of view toward Manzanar? (RI.8.6)

Responses will vary, but may include: The analogy makes a connection between the mountains and the endurance exhibited by the internees at Manzanar. Just as the mountains are able to survive the harsh weather and unpredictable conditions, so, too, were the people who lived at Manzanar. This suggests that Jeanne’s point of view toward Manzanar is that it didn’t break those who were forced to endure it; they were able to survive and rise above the injustices they experienced there. This analogy also shows Jeanne’s ambivalence toward her Japanese culture: in this case, it is valuable in its relation to nature and how it helps them endure.
