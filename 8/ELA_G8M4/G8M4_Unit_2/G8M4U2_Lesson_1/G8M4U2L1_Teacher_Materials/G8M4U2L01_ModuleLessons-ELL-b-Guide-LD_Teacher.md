5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

RI.8.1, RI.8.3, L.8.1a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

They also represented those forces in nature, those powerful and inevitable forces that cannot be resisted, **reminding a man that sometimes he must simply endure that which cannot be changed**. (from page 88 of *Farewell to Manzanar* by Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston and James D. Houston)

**Lesson 1 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive during Work Time B, as students analyze connections and distinctions in chapter 12 of the text.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target (**I can analyze how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, events, and ideas in chapter 12 of *Farewell to Manzanar****)* and RI.8.3 by providing an analogy that makes a connection between the mountains and forces in life that cannot be changed. It also helps to address RI.8.6, as it gives insight into Papa’s point of view toward his experience during the war and, perhaps, toward life in general. Lastly, it helps students to address L.8.1a, as it contains a participle adjective phrase (**reminding a man that sometimes he must simply endure that which cannot be changed**).

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses a participle phrase with the purpose of describing mountains as part of an analogy.

- Transfer: independent clause + participle phrase + noun to describe individuals from *Farewell to Manzanar* when writing a literary argument essay in the End of Unit 2 Assessment.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **They also represented those forces in nature, those powerful and inevitable forces that cannot be resisted, <u>reminding a man that sometimes he must simply endure that which cannot be changed</u>**.

- Ask:

“What is this sentence about?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **reminding a man that sometimes he must simply endure that which cannot be changed.**

- Ask:

“What do you notice about the language structure of this chunk?” (It is a participle phrase. We know this because it starts with an -ing word and it modifies the noun they at the beginning of the sentence.)

“What does it mean to endure something?” (to live through a painful experience)

- As needed, students can refer to a dictionary to verify the meaning of **endure**.

“What does this chunk tell us about the mountains?” (that they are a reminder that there are things in life that cannot be changed and can only be survived)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **They also represented those forces in nature, those powerful and inevitable forces that cannot be resisted, <u>reminding a man that sometimes he must simply endure that which cannot be changed</u>**.

- Ask:

“What connection are the writers making in this sentence?” (They are making a connection between the mountains and experiences and events in life that are too powerful to change or influence.)

“Can you figure out what authors’ method the writers use to make this connection?” (analogy)

“How does this sentence help us to understand Papa’s point of view toward his treatment and the treatment of other Japanese Americans during World War II?” (It tells us that he sees his treatment as unavoidable and something that he cannot change and must suffer and survive.)

“How does this sentence help us to understand the significant idea that Jeanne’s family found solace and the strength to survive by turning to nature and its lessons of endurance and patience?” (It provides an example of how Papa viewed mountains as a source of strength and guidance.)

- Ask:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target:
