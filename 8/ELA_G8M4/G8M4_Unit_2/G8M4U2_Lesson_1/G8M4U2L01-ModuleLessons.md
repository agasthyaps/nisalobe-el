Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.8.6 – Opening A: On an entrance ticket, students determine the authors’ purpose in writing *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- RI.8.6 – Work Time A: Students determine the authors’ point of view in chapter 12 of *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- RI.8.3 – Work Time B: Students analyze how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in chapter 12 of *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- RI.8.3 – Closing and Assessment A: Students complete an exit ticket in which they analyze how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in chapter 12 of *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- RI.8.6 – Closing and Assessment A: Students complete an exit ticket in which they analyze the authors’ point of view in chapter 12 and how that is conveyed by the connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in chapter 12 of *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners by persevering to read independently and collaborating with peers to analyze the text.

- In the excerpt of *Farewell to Manzanar* read in this lesson, the internees show perseverance as they work to make their lives in Manzanar tolerable in their jobs, hobbies, and improvements to living conditions.

- In Unit 3, students conduct research to learn more about activist organizations whose work embodies lessons from internment in their communities. Begin now to carefully consider the span of the “community” within which students should operate. In urban areas with large populations, it may be sufficient to consider the community to be the neighborhood or city within which students live. In smaller towns, it may be necessary to expand the definition of community to include neighboring cities, counties, or regions in the country.

- Successful participation in Unit 3, Lessons 6–12, requires that students are able to reach a local organization by phone and interview a representative of that organization. Ensure that students are able to make contact with organizations by beginning now to develop a short list of prevetted organizations. Begin to reach out to these organizations now to gauge their willingness to be interviewed and let them know of the date when they may expect a call. In Unit 3, students will be assigned one of the organizations from the list as one of the three organizations they research and prepare to interview.

- At this time, consider inviting community members such as other students, teachers, family members, and people associated with the prevetted organizations to join in the Activist Assembly for the performance task at the end of the module. Students may want to create formal, written invitations to send to these community members.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Standard RI.3 in Grades 9–10 requires students to analyze how an author unfolds a series of ideas or events, including the order in which the points are made, how they are introduced and developed, and the connections that are drawn between them. Have students analyze how the Houstons unfold a series of ideas or events in chapter 12, examining the order of the events and ideas, how they are introduced and developed, and the connections between them. They can create a flowchart of their analysis and share it with their classmates.

- As students read and learn more about the events involved in Japanese American internment in *Farewell to Manzanar*, invite students to research particular aspects of this time period that are of interest to them, such as daily life in Japanese American internment camps or other experiences in other internment camps. Consider providing questions like the following to guide this exploration:

- Who were the key individuals involved? How are they connected? What distinctions are there between these individuals?

- What are the key ideas or events? How are these ideas or events connected? What distinctions are there between these ideas or events?

- Release more responsibility more quickly to students as they comprehend the tasks or concepts:

- Allow those students who are identifying the gist and other elements quickly the opportunity to develop their own text-dependent questions about the chapter, related to connections and distinctions. Ask these students to share their questions with the group as a way of generating discussion.

- An optional Mini Language Dive, intended for use in Work Time B, is available in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students have focused on analyzing *Farewell to Manzanar* for its connections and distinctions among individuals, ideas, and events. In this lesson, students will continue this analysis and begin to analyze the authors’ point of view as well as how they distinguish their point of view from those of others.

Support All Students

- Presenting learning targets in writing, orally, and if possible, accompanied by symbols will help students to understand the language within them. ▲

- At this point, students should be reading the text independently. However, if some or all students need more support, read several pages aloud and then release students to read independently, in pairs, or in small groups. ▲

- Chapter 12 makes reference to Papa making and drinking alcohol. To support students in processing this content, ask: “What habit of character did you use as you read and discussed this chapter?” Students may need to draw on perseverance, empathy, and compassion as they read and discuss this content, being sensitive to their own and others’ reactions to the information presented.

- As in previous lessons, in Work Time A, present additional options for recording gist rather than just the sticky note, such as using a separate notebook, using a graphic organizer, using highlighters and annotating, or using a voice recorder. Give students options for expressing their understanding of gist (oral, written, or drawing). Also, build in different options for expressing comprehension of the text (written reflection, voice recording, or discussion with partners/groups). ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson follows a similar routine to lessons in Unit 1 of this module that focus on reading *Farewell to Manzanar*. Students will read the text and then engage in collaborative Think-Pair-Share discussions to explore connections and distinctions (RI.8.3) and significant ideas in the text. Students will also analyze point of view (RI.8.6). Work with connections and distinctions, significant ideas, and point of view will help to prepare students for the analysis they will do when writing an argument essay later in this unit for the End of Unit 2 Assessment.

- ELLs may find it challenging to identify connections and distinctions and the methods used by the authors to convey these. Continue to support students in carrying out this work by focusing on concrete examples of language in the text that conveys connections and distinctions, and use collaborative discussion as an opportunity for students to share in order to build upon one another’s perspectives.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6 and 8.II.A.1.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Connections and Distinctions: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catcher to ensure students understand how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- Although an author’s purpose and point of view are often related, be sure to draw a distinction for students between the two. An author’s purpose is generally to inform, to persuade, or to entertain. Once the authors of *Farewell to Manzanar* establish their main purpose in the foreword to inform, it remains consistent throughout the text. Their point of view may vary depending on the topic about which they are writing.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will read chapter 13 of *Farewell to Manzanar* and continue to analyze how the text makes connections and distinctions among individuals, ideas, and events, as well as authors’ point of view.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.8.6 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **2**, **Lesson** **1**. Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique to review their responses. Refer to **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **2**, **Lesson** **1** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Explain that beginning in this lesson, students will be analyzing the authors’ point of view toward the individuals, events, and ideas in the book. Remind them that an author’s purpose is often revealed through an examination of point of view.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

- Invite students to briefly recall and review purpose and point of view using the text from Module 2: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*. In Module 2, students read this text and considered Michael Pollan’s purpose and motivation in writing the text and in sharing information, and determined his point of view toward various concepts and practices. Recalling this information will help to ground students in concepts of point of view and purpose as they begin work with these in this unit.

For Heavier Support

- Review the concepts of purpose and point of view to help students understand the differences between the two. Create a simple chart with two columns, one labeled ““ of view,” and one labeled “purpose.” Invite students to generate examples of their point of view and purpose in doing familiar activities like the following:

- Attending school:

- Purpose: to learn

- Point of view: It’s fun to see my friends at school.

- Reading a book:

- Purpose: to gather information

- Point of view: It’s harder than watching TV.

Point out to students that there is more than one possible purpose and point of view for each activity. Help students to understand that when authors write a text, they also have a purpose for doing so and a point of view about the topic. Likewise, individuals within a book have a point of view toward ideas, events, experiences, and other individuals.

Work Time

A. Read *Farewell to Manzanar*, Chapter 12 – RI.8.6 (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Read chapter 12 in ***Farewell to Manzanar***. Use the **Text** **Guide**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students who are ready to read independently or in small groups should be released to do so. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky** **notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary in their **vocabulary** **logs**, update the **Gist**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **anchor** **chart**, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Refer to the **Gist**: ***Farewell to Manzanar* anchor** **chart** **(example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) and **Work** **to** **Become** **Ethical** **People** **anchor** **chart** as needed.

- If students do not finish reading the chapter within the allotted reading time, distribute **Synopsis**: ***Farewell to Manzanar,*** **Chapter** **12** to each student to review the key details from the chapter.

- Prompt students to Turn and Talk:

“What is the gist of chapter 12?” (The family moves to a new block; life becomes “tolerable” with more room, more finished buildings, work, school, and hobbies.)

- With students’ support, record the meanings of *shrewd* (perceptive, smart), *turmoil* (confusion, disturbance), *sustenance* (means of sustaining life), *subdued* (quiet, repressed, controlled), and *suspended* (stopped temporarily, interrupted) on the **academic** **word** **wall**, with translations in students’ home languages. Write synonyms or sketch a visual above the words to scaffold students’ understanding. Invite students to record these words in their vocabulary logs.

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What examples of habits of character were evident in this chapter?” (Responses will vary, but may mention how the internees show perseverance as they work to make their lives in Manzanar tolerable in their jobs, hobbies, and improvements to living conditions.)

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What is the authors’ point of view toward Manzanar in the spring of 1943, and how do they convey that point of view?” (Responses will vary, but may include: The authors seem to convey a more positive attitude toward Manzanar due to the changes that occurred in the spring of 1943. They convey this by explaining those changes and by providing examples of the activities and events that helped the internees feel like they had a more normal life.)

“What evidence from the text helps to convey that point of view?” (Responses will vary, but may include: “ . . . those trees stand in my memory for the turning of our life in camp, from the outrageous to the tolerable” (85).

Work Time

B. Analyze Connections and Distinctions: *Farewell to Manzanar*, Chapter 12 – RI.8.3 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in *Farewell to Manzanar*.”

- Ask students to retrieve the **Connections** **and** **Distinctions**: ***Farewell to Manzanar* note** - **catcher**.

- Direct students to work with a partner to complete at least one connection or distinction in the table for chapter 12 on the Connections and Distinctions: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catcher. Suggest that they revisit the point of view work from Work Time A to uncover one possible connection. Remind them to use the **Authors’** **Methods** **anchor** **chart** as needed. Refer to the **Authors’** **Methods** **anchor** **chart** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as necessary.

- Use a total participation technique to have each pair share the connection/distinction they identified and explained in their note-catcher. If students don’t mention analogy or don’t understand the analogy in chapter 12, review it as a class. Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What is an analogy? How do the authors use the mountains as part of an analogy in chapter 12?” (An analogy is a comparison that explains a potentially new idea or thing by connecting it to a different and familiar idea or thing. The authors use the mountains as an analogy to the ways of thinking by the internees that helped them to survive.)

- Invite pairs who explained unique connections or distinctions to come to different sections of the board or **chart** **paper** posted around the room to record their explanation. Allow several minutes for students to find on the board or chart papers a connection/distinction that is different from the one they explained. They can read the posted explanation and record the connection/distinction in their note-catcher. Refer to **Connections** **and** **Distinctions**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **note** - **catcher** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Refocus the class to unpack methods, terms, and definitions as needed and add examples for relevant methods used to the Authors’ Methods anchor chart, including adding *analogy*. Refer to the Authors’ Methods anchor chart (example for teacher reference) as necessary.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- After Work Time B, invite students to participate in a Mini Language Dive in small groups to explore how the writers use an analogy to make a connection between the mountains and forces in life that cannot be changed (RI.8.3). This sentence also helps to address RI.8.6, as it gives insight into Papa’s point of view toward his experience during the war and, perhaps, toward life in general. Lastly, it helps students to address L.8.1a, as it contains a participle adjective phrase (*reminding a man that sometimes he must simply endure that which cannot be changed*).

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from *Farewell to Manzanar*. Provide ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Invite students who need lighter support to predict some of the questions that the Language Dive may ask. This will improve students’ metacognition and challenge their awareness of the most interesting or meaningful elements of the sentence. Students may also choose to carry out one of the following:

- Paraphrase the sentence using your own words.

- Underline all noun phrases, circle all verb phrases, and star all adjective and adverb phrases. What words do you have left? What are the functions of these phrases?

For Heavier Support

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from *Farewell to Manzanar*. Provide ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Encourage students who need heavier support to independently reflect on this sentence and its meaning before the next lesson. Students may also choose to carry out one of the following:

- Make a guess about what the chunks of the sentence might be.

- Use a dictionary to look up the word *twirling*, and select the best definition for the word as it is used in this sentence.

Closing and Assessment

A. Exit Ticket – RI.8.3, RI.8.6 (10 minutes)

- Distribute **Exit** **Ticket**: **Unit** **2**, **Lesson** **1**. Direct students to complete the questions. Collect and review the responses to check for understanding. Refer to **Exit** **Ticket**: **Unit** **2**, **Lesson** **1** (**answers** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Draw students’ attention to the **Significant** **Ideas** **anchor** **chart**, and ask:

“What significant idea is conveyed by the connection on the exit ticket?” (Jeanne’s family found solace and the strength to survive by turning to nature and its lessons of endurance and patience.)

- Add the significant idea to the anchor chart. Refer to **Significant** **Ideas** **anchor** **chart** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Analyze Connections and Distinctions

- Students finish completing the note-catcher for chapter 12 as needed.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread chapter 13 (pages 93–104) of *Farewell to Manzanar* in preparation for studying the chapter in the next lesson.
