Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RL.8.7 – Work Time A: Students use note-catchers to track the choices by the filmmakers of *Farewell to Manzanar* to convey the text.

- RL.8.7 – Closing and Assessment A: Students draw connections between the text and the film *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become ethical people by showing respect, compassion, and empathy as they watch and process sensitive content in the *Farewell to Manzanar* film.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Students can read chapter 6 and analyze how it compares to similar moments in the film. They can then add this analysis to the Compare Text to Film note-catchers.

- The RL.7 standard for Grades 9–10 asks students to analyze the representation of a subject or key scene in two different artistic mediums, including what is emphasized in each treatment. Ask students to find a photograph of a key moment in Manzanar, such as the riot, and analyze the film and archival photographic versions of the moment, noting what is emphasized in each treatment. They can create a Venn diagram of the text, film, and photograph and share the diagram with their classmates.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- This lesson is the third of four in which students watch and analyze a segment of the *Farewell to Manzanar* film. As in previous lessons, students analyze moments in a film segment and determine the extent to which the moments stay faithful to or depart from corresponding chapters in the text.

Support All Students

- The film segment shown in this lesson contains content from chapters 5, 8, 9, and 11. Provide additional time as needed for students to review these chapters before watching the film. ▲

- Continue to use closed captioning to add English subtitles to the film, supporting listening comprehension for ELLs. ▲

- This segment of the film features sensitive content and situations that some students may find upsetting. For example, a riot breaks out at Manzanar, and the guards at Manzanar fire gunshots at protestors. A subsequent scene suggests that some protestors have been killed. Though the riots are not depicted with graphic or overly violent imagery, students may still find this content challenging to process. As needed, build time into the lesson for students to examine their feelings about the riot aloud with a partner or privately in writing.

- This film segment also shows Papa drinking. Because his dangerous relationship with alcohol is described in the accompanying chapters of the text, students are unlikely to be surprised to see this conveyed on screen; nonetheless, some students may find it challenging to watch Papa drink so much as to “seek oblivion,” as Jeanne narrates in a voiceover. Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually.

- If necessary, to support student note-taking, pause the film at the end of each moment as indicated in the Compare Text to Film note-catcher. ▲

- For homework, as an alternative to having students scan chapters 14–17 of *Farewell to Manzanar*, assign each student to preread the chapter for the text they will be responsible for during the jigsaw in Lesson 4. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson follows a procedure that is similar to lessons in which students view the film adaptation of *Farewell to Manzanar* in Unit 1. In this lesson, students will watch the third of four film segments, which aligns with chapters of *Farewell to Manzanar* that students have already read, reinforcing this content. As they watch the film, students will track the film choices made by the director, screenwriter, and actors using a note-catcher and then share their observations with classmates in the Closing and Assessment of the lesson.

- ELLs may find it challenging to record notes while they watch the film, as this requires careful attention to both visual and linguistic input (the film’s content) and output (writing on the note-catcher). Encourage students to take notes using simple words and phrases while watching and to then go back and refine what they have written immediately after viewing the film. Remind students that the sequence of events in the film may not follow the sequence of events in the text exactly and to be mindful of differences and potentially new content as they watch.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standard 8.I.B.6.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Compare Text to Film note-catchers to ensure that students are meaningfully and accurately capturing the ways in which the filmmakers convey significant ideas from the text.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Jigsaw protocol to read chapters 14–17 of *Farewell to Manzanar*. They will continue to identify and analyze connections between and distinctions among individuals, events, and ideas in the text.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Invite students to retrieve their **Compare** **Text** **to** **Film**: ***Farewell to Manzanar* note** - **catchers**. Draw their attention to the third table, for Film Segment 3. Ask students to note the four moments of focus described in the left-hand column of the table. Remind students that these moments are the four sections of the film segment that they will focus on as they watch.

- Refer students to the page numbers included in the right-hand column of the third table. Remind students that this is where these moments can be found within the chapters they have already read. Ask students to retrieve their copies of the text ***Farewell to Manzanar***, and give them a few minutes to revisit these pages, reminding themselves of the content and the ways in which the authors have conveyed these moments in the text.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Analyze *Farewell to Manzanar*, Part 3 – RL.8.7 (35 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze the extent to which the film *Farewell to Manzanar* stays faithful to or departs from the text, evaluating the filmmakers’ choices.”

- Tell students that they are now going to watch the third segment of the ***Farewell to Manzanar* film**. They will use their Compare Text to Film: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catchers, taking notes in the Film Segment 3 table. Give students a moment to review their notes from Film Segments 1 and 2 to remind themselves of their earlier work.

- Remind students to keep in mind the habits of character on the **Work** **to** **Become** **Effective** **Learners** **anchor** **chart** and the **Work** **to** **Become** **Ethical** **People** **anchor** **chart** as they watch the film.

- Use a **device** to show the third segment of the film *Farewell to Manzanar* (00:52:47–01:15:20). As students watch, monitor their attention and progress on their note-catchers, providing encouragement and clarification as needed. If necessary to support student note-taking, pause the film at the end of each moment as indicated in the Compare Text to Film note-catcher. Refer to the **Compare** **Text** **to** **Film**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **note** - **catcher** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as needed.

- After they watch the third segment, allow students time to add notes to the right-hand column of the note-catcher. Remind students that these notes should describe the extent to which the moments analyzed in the film stay faithful to or depart from the text as well as how these moments develop significant ideas in the text. Students should use their copies of the *Farewell to Manzanar* text to help them recall how moments were conveyed in the text. Students will have additional time to complete these notes for homework as well.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- As in Unit 1, before students view the third segment of the film adaptation of *Farewell to Manzanar* in Work Time A, invite them to make a list of significant ideas from chapters 5, 8, 9, and 11 of the text. This will help to orient students to the film viewing task and help them to focus on key events, ideas, and individuals from the text.

Closing and Assessment

A. Peer Share: Compare Text to Film – RL.8.7 (5 minutes)

- Direct students to pair up and share their notes from their note-catchers, focusing on their notes about the extent to which moments in the film segment stayed faithful to or departed from the text. Each student will give one star and one step to help improve his or her partner’s notes.

- Monitor students’ discussions, and use specific questions to cue students to think with others and expand the conversation:

“How is what you wrote different from what your partner wrote?”

“Can you explain why your partner wrote it this way?”

“Can you add to your partner’s ideas about this moment in the film?”

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- During the peer share discussion in Closing and Assessment A, use strategic combinations of Conversation Cues to help students who need heavier support to be understood and to understand others:

- “I’ll give you a minute to think.”

- “Can you say more about that?”

- “So, do you mean \_\_\_\_\_?”

- “Who can repeat what your classmate said?”

Homework

A. Complete Compare Text to Film Note-Catcher

- As necessary, students add notes to their Compare Text to Film: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catcher, drawing on their anchor text and **Connections** **and** **Distinctions**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **note** - **catcher** to determine how the film is faithful to or departs from the text. They also analyze how the moments in the text and film develop significant ideas.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students skim chapters 14–17 of *Farewell to Manzanar* in preparation for a jigsaw that centers on these chapters in the next lesson.
