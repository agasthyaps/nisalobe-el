**Focus Prompt:** One significant idea in the text *Farewell to Manzanar* is that Papa feels deeply conflicted loyalties, both to Japan and to America. How effectively does the film *Farewell to Manzanar* convey this significant idea?

**Introduction**

How will you catch the reader’s attention? (Consider using facts, statistics, quotations, or anecdotes.)

• Use vivid and precise language.

• Include facts and descriptions of relevant events.

What context about the text or topic does your reader need in order to make sense of the rest of your essay?

• Papa and his role in the text

• the idea of internment

• how internment led to feelings of conflicted loyalties in Japanese

Americans like Papa

• the significant idea and how it is conveyed in the text

Main Claim:

By looking at key moments of the text and the film, we can see that the film *Farewell to Manzanar* effectively conveys this significant idea of Papa’s painful conflicted loyalties.

What are the two main points or reasons you will be offering to support this focus?

The filmmakers’ choices in the moments when Papa burns the Japanese flag and when he is interrogated faithfully capture the events, mood, or impact of the moments.

Point or Reason 1:

The filmmakers’ choices in the moment when Papa burns the Japanese flag faithfully convey Papa’s conflicted loyalties.

Point or Reason 2:

The filmmakers’ choices in the moment when Papa is being interrogated faithfully convey Papa’s conflicted loyalties.

**Proof Paragraph(s) for Point 1**

Point 1: What is the first point <u>from the text</u> you are offering to support your claim?

In one important early moment from the text, Jeanne describes her father on the night of the bombing of Pearl Harbor.

Evidence: What evidence <u>from the text</u> supports this point?

• Describes beautiful Japanese flag, brought thirty-five years earlier when he left Hiroshima

• Hours after hearing of the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, Papa burns the flag (6).

Reasoning: What reasoning develops your point and ties it back to the claim?

Keeping the flag all those years shows how much Papa’s homeland of Japan still means to him; burning it shows how much his sense of being American means to him; Papa feels very conflicted about burning the flag.

Point 1: What is the first point <u>from the film</u> you are offering to support your claim?

The filmmakers choose several techniques to capture this significant idea.

Evidence: What evidence <u>from the film</u> supports this point?

• Lighting is dim, which emphasizes the bright, devouring flames.

• Jeanne speaks in a voiceover, “I had never seen my mother and father so angry and so sad at the same time.”

• Papa holds his gaze at the flag in his hands, as if realizing what a big moment this is, then throws it into the flames.

• His face twists with emotion as dramatic music plays.

• Papa bows his head before the burning flag, almost as if he is praying.

Reasoning: What reasoning develops your point and ties it back to the claim?

Filmmakers’ choices convey how deeply Papa loves Japan even as he destroys all the connections he has with it.

Proof Paragraph(s) for Point 2

Point 2: What is the second point <u>from the text</u> you are offering to support your claim?

In another important moment from the text, Papa is interrogated at Fort Lincoln.

Evidence: What evidence <u>from the text</u> supports this point?

He is being held as a prisoner. The interrogator asks Papa who he wants to win the war: Japan or the United States. Papa answers, “When your mother and your father are having a fight, do you want them to kill each other? Or do you just want them to stop fighting?” (58).

Reasoning: What reasoning develops your point and ties it back to the claim?

Connection between ideas of parents and countries emphasizes how much Papa loves both countries; how hard it is for him to see them fighting in a war.

Point 2: What is the second point <u>from the film</u> you are offering to support your claim?

In this moment in the film, the filmmakers use body language to convey these conflicted loyalties.

Evidence: What evidence <u>from the film</u> supports this point?

• Papa’s eyebrows are furrowed.

• He looks concerned and upset.

• He looks down at the ground rather than at the interrogator.

• When the man asks Papa whom he wants to win the war, Papa looks up.

• He holds strong eye contact to deliver his important analogy comparing the United States and Japan to parents.

Reasoning: What reasoning develops your point and ties it back to the claim?

• Change in the actor’s body language signals to the viewer that Papa is saying something important.

• He wants the interrogator to understand his conflicted feelings about Japan and the United States.

• With powerful eye contact and body language, the filmmakers show the significant idea of the pain Papa feels about his conflicted loyalties.

**Counterclaim**

Counterclaim: What counterclaim might others raise to refute your claims?

• Some might argue that the film does not effectively convey Papa’s conflicted loyalties because the film contains details that depart from the text.

• Example: flag scene in book does not feature Papa speaking aloud, does not describe body language. In the film, Papa says the flag was a gift and shows meaningful body language.

Refute: How do you respond to this counterclaim?

This is a departure, but the details are in line with the significant idea.

Reasoning: What reasoning supports your response?

Extra details add emotional intensity to the scene and make it clear how conflicted Papa feels.

**Conclusion**

Briefly restate your main claim from the introduction:

All in all, the film effectively conveys the idea of Papa’s conflicted loyalties.

What are your further reflections on this topic?

- Why does this argument/claim matter?

- What would happen if this claim were not acted upon?

- Who is likely to benefit from this?

Claim matters because it is important that film helps viewers understand how sad and personal conflicted loyalties feel as a result of internment at Manzanar.
