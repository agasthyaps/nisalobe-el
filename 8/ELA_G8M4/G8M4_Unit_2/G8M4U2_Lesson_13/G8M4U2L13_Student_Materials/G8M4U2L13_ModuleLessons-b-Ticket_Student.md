**Directions:** As you enter class, read Proof Paragraph 1 from Model Literary Argument Essay: “How *Farewell to Manzanar* Conveys Jeanne’s Youth,” and respond to the questions that follow.

<u>In one important early moment from the text, Jeanne and her family are on the bus to Manzanar.</u> **The text describes her as “full of excitement, the way any kid would be” (16). She tries to befriend the bus driver and eagerly wants to look out the window.** Feeling excited on the way to an internment camp illustrates how Jeanne’s naivete impacts her understanding of what awaits her and her family. Clearly, Manzanar is nothing like the camp Jeanne is anticipating. <u>The filmmakers choose several techniques to capture this significant idea.</u> **They introduce a new character, another young girl on the bus. The two girls have a conversation about what to expect at Manzanar. The actor portraying Jeanne speaks quickly and excitedly as she describes the “camp” that her Caucasian friends have attended in the past. Those friends told her that camp, with all its swimming and hiking and sleeping outside, was “really fun.”** The filmmakers’ choices in this moment convey how Jeanne’s youth impacts her understanding of Manzanar. Through its dramatic touches regarding characters, voice, and dialogue, the film remains faithful to the ideas in the text. Jeanne’s youth and naivete are clear. She is on the way to an internment camp, but does not fully understand what this means for her and her family.
