The actor portraying Jeanne speaks quickly and excitedly as she describes the “camp” that her Caucasian friends have attended in the past. Those friends told her that camp, with all its swimming and hiking and sleeping outside, was “really fun.”</td>

<td>The filmmakers’ choices in this moment convey how Jeanne’s youth impacts her understanding of Manzanar. Through its dramatic touches regarding characters, voice, and dialogue, the film remains faithful to the ideas in the text. Jeanne’s youth and naivete are clear. She is on the way to an internment camp, but does not fully understand what this means for her and her family.</td>
