Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.8.1b – Opening A: Students answer questions as they analyze the role sentences play in Proof Paragraph 1 of the model argument essay.

- W.8.1b – Work Time A: Students use the Painted Essay® structure to more closely analyze a model Proof Paragraph to understand how it supports a point/reason with valid reasoning and relevant evidence.

- W.8.1b – Work Time B: Students orally rehearse their Proof Paragraph 1 sharing points, evidence, and the reasoning that connects back to the main claim.

- W.8.5 – Work Time B: Students orally rehearse their Proof Paragraph 1 with a partner and make a plan to enhance their writing as needed.

- W.8.1b – Work Time C: Students work in pairs to draft their Proof Paragraph 1, choosing relevant evidence to support their claims and using logical reasoning to explain their thinking.

- W.8.4 – Work Time C: Students work with a partner to produce clear and coherent Proof Paragraphs.

- W.8.5 – Work Time C: Students write a Proof Paragraph that includes a point that supports the main claim with relevant evidence and sufficient reasoning.

- Students focus on working to become effective learners, focusing on collaborating with peers while writing their practice essay and persevering to independently plan a Proof Paragraph.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release those students who are ready to read and analyze the model Proof Paragraph 1 independently and then move on to drafting Proof Paragraph 1 of their practice essay with a partner.

- Provide students with the opportunity to analyze the transitional words in the model essay. Consider partner work that supports students to identify words that signal sequence or transition in additional sources—reviewing informational texts from Unit 1. Synthesizing and listing transitional words on an anchor chart will enhance student understanding.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the second half of this unit, students have been analyzing a model and using their analysis to draft the introduction of their practice essay. This lesson continues those routines to guide students in writing the Proof Paragraph 1 of their essay.

Support All Students

- In Lessons 11–16, students work with the same partner on a practice argument essay. Provide differentiated support by purposefully preselecting student partnerships.

- While students will complete their own written version of the practice essay in Lessons 11–16, consider the variety of ways that student partnerships can support one another to more deeply understand the genre of argument writing and successfully complete their work. Choral reading, peer planning, shared writing, shared evidence gathering, clarifying tasks, varying scribing responsibilities, editing support, etc. are all possible roles partners can play for one another in these lessons. ▲

- Students may not have experience with double-decker sandwiches (the image used to describe the two-part evidence structure in the Proof Paragraphs). As necessary when discussing the evidence sandwiches in Work Time A, sketch or display an image of a double-decker sandwich with three or four pieces of bread and two fillings. ▲

- Students may need additional support while writing their Proof Paragraph. Group those students for a discussion to help them find the best evidence to support their points/reasons and elaborate on that evidence, providing reasoning to show it supports the point.▲

- Although students have had practice creating accurate citations, provide various examples of accurate citations for students to view online or scribed on an anchor chart as they work to include relevant evidence in their Proof Paragraph. ▲

- Students may have limited argument writing experience and may be unfamiliar with strong Proof Paragraphs, in this and other genres. Providing examples and scaffolded support (sentence stems, annotated graphic organizers, models of Proof Paragraphs and opportunities to talk through their ideas) will help their writing. If needed, pull a small group to review this aspect of argument writing. ▲

- In Work Time A, students will be guided to use the visual concept of an evidence sandwich as a way of identifying and analyzing the parts of a Proof Paragraph. They will use this both to deconstruct the model essay, and to help guide the planning and writing of their own practice essays. ▲

- Pull small instructional groups who need more scaffolding and support. Students might need extended verbal processing time to develop their reasoning statements. ▲

- Consistently referring to the model argument essay will act as a support for students who need reminders of what strong writing looks like. ▲

- Providing written and verbal directions and charting the steps they will take on an anchor chart could help students as they plan for their writing. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson follows a similar sequence to Lesson 12 with scaffolded tasks that guide students from analysis to independent writing. Students work in groups to analyze Proof Paragraph 1 of the model essay before planning Proof Paragraph 1 of the practice argument essay. Ample time for discussion and oral planning is built into the lesson, and the Closing and Assessment of the lesson invites students to give and receive feedback to further their learning and writing during a pair share.

- ELLs may find it challenging to complete their own written version of the practice essay, even with peer collaboration. Pair ELLs thoughtfully with supportive peers who can help them navigate the complexities of the task sequencing and the tasks themselves, and encourage students to refer back to the model essay, the text, and the Argument Writing checklist, frequently, while writing.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.C.11 and 8.I.C.12.

Assessment Guidance

- Use the Grade 8 Writing Process checklist to assess students’ writing abilities in Work Times B and C (see the Tools page at http://eled.org/tools).

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will write the Proof Paragraph 2 of their practice argument essay. In Lesson 15, students will write the counterclaim of their practice argument essay. In Lesson 16, students will work on their conclusions. Students then plan and write an independent argument essay during their End of Unit 3 Assessment in Lessons 17–19.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.8.1b (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **2**, **Lesson** **13**.

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique to review their responses. Refer to **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **2**, **Lesson** **13** (**answers** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Clarify any misconceptions about the role that the opening and closing sentences play in Proof Paragraphs (stating the point that supports the main claim and restating the point supporting the main claim), and answer any questions from the group. Make sure students notice that the first point names a moment from the text and that the final sentence concludes the reasoning by restating the main claim.

- Ask students to refer to their **Practice** **Argument** **Essay** **Writing** **Plan** **graphic** **organizer** and review the opening and closing sentences they planned for the Proof Paragraphs in their practice essay.

- Direct students to Turn and Talk about the following questions:

“What opening sentence could you write that states a point that supports your main claim?” (Responses will vary.)

“What closing sentence could you write that restates the point that supports your main claim?” (Responses will vary.)

- Inform students that they will have the opportunity to refine the sentences in Work Time B.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- Before students answer the questions about the Proof Paragraph on Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 13, provide them with the sentences from the paragraph cut into strips. Students can unscramble the sentences to put together the paragraph. This tactile activity will require students to think carefully about the meaning of each sentence.

Work Time

A. Analyze the Model: Proof Paragraph 1 – W.8.1b (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify the points, evidence, and reasoning in Proof Paragraph 1 of a model argument essay.”

- Remind students that one of the most important aspects of a Proof Paragraph is including evidence that directly supports the points stated. Within each Proof Paragraph, the author creates an evidence sandwich. Remind students that thinking about something we are all familiar with, a sandwich, will help us see how Proof Paragraphs are built. The evidence sandwich includes three parts:

- The point (bread)

- The evidence introduced, with any context (the filling)

- The reasoning (more bread)

- Ask students to retrieve their **Model** **Argument** **Essay**: “ **How** ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **Conveys** **Jeanne’s** **Youth**.” Read Proof Paragraph 1 aloud, prompting students to think about these three components of a Proof Paragraph as they follow along. Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“Remember that this essay needs double-decker evidence sandwiches. Where do you see those in this Proof Paragraph? Why do we need two evidence sandwiches?” (We need to give evidence about both the text and the film.)

- Confirm for students that the first part of the paragraph provides a description of a moment from the text, and the second part provides a description of the moment in the film. Remind students of their work with the evidence sandwich in Module 2. Explain that the Proof Paragraphs in the model essay (and their own essays) will have a double-decker evidence sandwich. In other words, there will be two evidence sandwiches in each Proof Paragraph. Inform students that they will use a note-catcher to examine the double-decker evidence sandwich.

- Distribute and display the **Analyze** **the** **Model**: **Proof** **Paragraph** **note** - **catcher**. Point out the organization of the note-catcher to students. Tell them that it names the point of the Proof Paragraph at the top. Then it includes the text of Proof Paragraph 1 from the Model Argument Essay, but it is chunked into six parts.

- Read aloud the first chunk of text from the note-catcher. Tell students that this sentence is the point that names the moment from the text. This sentence is the first point. It names the moment from the text that will be analyzed. In the evidence sandwich, it is the top piece of bread. Label these parts on the Analyze the Model: Proof Paragraph note-catcher, using the **Analyze** **the** **Model**: **Proof** **Paragraph** **note** - **catcher** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as needed.

- Continue on to the next chunk of text, and select a student to read the second chunk of text aloud to the group. Tell students that this chunk of text is the evidence. The evidence section of the evidence sandwich introduces the evidence with any additional context the reader needs to understand the evidence, and then lists the actual evidence itself, which might include a quote.

- Ask partners to read the third chunk of text with each other. Tell students that this bottom bread section of the evidence sandwich is the reasoning. Remind students that in addition to selecting supporting evidence, another critical aspect of a Proof Paragraph is the reasoning. Remind students that this kind of connected thinking is called *reasoning*, and writers use reasoning to further explain and discuss their main claim.

- Ask students to work with their collaborative essay partner to label the bread/point, filling/evidence, and bread/reasoning for the next three chunks (the film evidence sandwich) of Proof Paragraph 1 on the Analyze the Model Proof Paragraph note-catcher. Use a total participation technique to review student responses, using the Analyze the Model: Proof Paragraph note-catcher (example for teacher reference) as needed. Be sure students notice that the second evidence sandwich is still developing the first point/scene in the essay, the moment when Jeanne and her family are on their way to Manzanar.

- Reinforce the importance of using reasoning to develop the point, and further explain the importance of the evidence.

- Share with students that they will be creating evidence sandwiches and paying careful attention to crafting adequate reasoning sentences as they write their Proof Paragraph 1.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“Describe the important elements of an evidence sandwich.” (Evidence sandwiches have three parts: point, evidence, and reasoning.)

“What are your important takeaways about how writers use reasoning in a Proof Paragraph?” (Students should point out that reasoning further explains the evidence, ties it to the point and main claim, and helps the reader understand the writer’s thinking.)

“What is different about the Proof Paragraphs in these argument essays about the text and film versions of *Farewell to Manzanar*?” (They have two evidence sandwiches in each Proof Paragraph.)

- Invite students to help record important aspects of Proof Paragraphs on the **Characteristics** **of** **Argument** **Writing** **anchor** **chart**.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Work Time

B. Orally Rehearse Proof Paragraph 1 – W.8.5 (10 minutes)

- Ask students to join their practice essay partner. Provide students an opportunity to orally review the plan they created for Proof Paragraph 1 of their practice essay, planned in Lesson 11. Students should orally rehearse both evidence sandwiches they plan on using in their practice essay Proof Paragraph 1. Students can use the spaces provided on their Practice Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer to guide their planning and oral rehearsal.

- As applicable, support students by prompting pairs to ask each other the following six questions:

“What will you write as your text point/bread?” (Responses should identify the points students already planned together in Lesson 11.)

“What will you write as your text evidence/filling?” (Responses will vary.)

“What will you write as your text reasoning/bread?” (Responses will vary.)

“What will you write as your film point/bread?” (Responses should identify the points students already planned together in Lesson 11.)

“What will you write as your film evidence/filling?” (Responses will vary.)

“What will you write as your film reasoning/bread?” (Responses will vary.)

- Consult the **Practice** **Argument** **Essay** **Writing** **Plan** **graphic** **organizer** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) for possible student responses.

- Invite students to update the plan they created for Proof Paragraph 1 of their practice essay by recording their responses to the questions above.

Work Time

C. Practice Essay: Draft Proof Paragraph 1 – W.8.1b, W.8.4 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can write Proof Paragraph 1 for my practice essay.”

- Tell students they are now ready to draft Proof Paragraph 1 of their practice essays.

- Invite students to retrieve their **devices** and gather any remaining materials from the list below, and to refer to the Characteristics of Argument Writing anchor chart as they write:

- Model Argument Essay: “How *Farewell to Manzanar* Conveys Jeanne’s Youth”

- **Argument** **Writing** **checklist**

- **Painted** **Essay** ® **template**

- Practice Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer

- ***Farewell to Manzanar***

- **Connections** **and** **Distinctions**: ***Farewell to Manzanar* note** - **catcher**

- **Compare** **Text** **to** **Film**: ***Farewell to Manzanar* note** - **catcher**

- **Close** **Read**: ***Farewell to Manzanar***, **Chapter** **7** **note** - **catcher**

- **Significant** **Ideas** **anchor** **chart**

- Circulate to support students as they write and to identify common issues to use as whole group teaching points.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Closing and Assessment

A. Pair Share Proof Paragraph 1 – W.8.1b (5 minutes)

- Display and invite students to retrieve their copies of the Argument Writing checklist. Point out the following criteria on the checklist:

- “W.8.1a: My reasons and evidence are organized logically, in a way that is easy to follow.”

- “W.8.1b: I support my claim with logical reasoning and relevant evidence.”

- Invite each pair to swap Proof Paragraphs with another pair, paying attention to the criteria listed above.

- Ask students to share relevant feedback and to note any necessary revisions.

- As necessary, ask questions such as the following:

“What strengths can you identify in your partner’s work?”

“What next steps can you name for your partner?”

- Invite students to record “Y” for *Yes* and the date in the final column of their Argument Writing checklist if they feel the criteria marked on their checklists have been achieved in their writing in this lesson. Invite students to apply feedback they received by revising their Proof Paragraph 1.

- Use total participation techniques to gather responses from the group regarding strengths and next steps for drafting their Proof Paragraph 2 independently in the next lesson.

For Lighter Support

- During the pair share portion of this lesson, encourage students to generate a list of three specific stars and three specific steps for improvement for their partners. Encourage celebration and build students’ confidence by inviting each student to share out one special strength they identified in their partner’s introduction.

For Heavier Support

- During the pair share, to maximize feedback, have students work in small groups of three or four, rather than pairs, to provide an opportunity for students to receive feedback from more than one person. This will also allow students to see multiple examples of others’ writing, which will help to inform students’ own work, as well.

Homework

A. Revise Proof Paragraph 1

- Students revise Proof Paragraph 1 of their practice argument essay, based on feedback and criteria.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent** **reading** **journal**.
