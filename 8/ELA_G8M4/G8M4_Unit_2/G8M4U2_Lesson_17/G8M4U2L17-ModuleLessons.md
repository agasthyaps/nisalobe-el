Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.8.1a – Opening A: Students review the evidence collected on their Compare Text to Film note-catchers and locate the significant idea that they want to make the focus of their independent argument essays.

- RL.8.7 – Work Time A: Students plan their independent argument essays. As they evaluate the effectiveness of the film in conveying significant ideas of the text, students examine the extent to which the film departs from or stays faithful to the text.

- W.8.1 – Work Time A: Students plan argument essays to support claims with clear reasons and relevant evidence.

- W.8.4 – Work Time A: Students plan essays, aiming to produce clear and coherent writing that is appropriate to task, purpose, and audience.

- W.8.1c – Closing and Assessment A: Students consider the words and phrases they use in their plans to create cohesion and clarify the relationships among claim(s), counterclaims, reasons, and evidence.

- L.8.6 – Closing and Assessment A: Students accurately use grade-appropriate academic and domain-specific vocabulary in their plans for their essays.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners by demonstrating perseverance as they plan their independent argument essays.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Identify students in class who are particularly good at different aspects of the writing process (e.g., developing counterclaims, using transition words, or incorporating academic language). Allow them to conference with their classmates to give advice on their area of expertise.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students analyzed a model literary argument essay and used their analysis to practice writing an argument essay with a classmate. In this lesson, students will use what they learned during the collaborative writing process to independently complete their evidence gathering and then plan their argument essays.

Support All Students

- Some students may feel nervous by the idea of writing an argument essay on their own. Remind them they have already written an argument essay in Module 2. Point out the similarities in structure between that essay and the collaborative essay of this module. Help students recognize that much of their thinking about the essay topic has already taken place as they gathered their evidence while reading and watching *Farewell to Manzanar*. Encourage them to shift their mental energy to differences in content, purpose, and audience between the two types of writing tasks.

- Remind students that the more they plan their essays now, the easier the Argument Essay task will be in the following lesson. It may be helpful for some students to have an opportunity to interact and discuss their ideas aloud before beginning to plan independently.

- Some students may find it more helpful to visually represent their ideas. Encourage these students to generate a mental map to depict the relationships across the content details of their essays. If a student creates a mental map instead of completing their writing planners, make sure they understand that all of the information from the planner must be represented in the map.

- Provide students with individual photocopies of anchor charts for use as they plan their essays. Encourage students to annotate their copies to help with processing and planning writing. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson is centered on dedicated time for students to plan for the independent essay they will write for the End of Unit 2 Assessment. The lesson includes repeated routines, embedded Think-Pair-Shares, and continued scaffolding with the writing process as students move into planning their individual literary argument essays.

- ELLs may find it challenging to plan an essay independently after having worked collaboratively on the practice essay. Likewise, some students may find it difficult to pinpoint areas for improvement in their writing. Remind students that the practice they have done will support them in carrying out this work. As needed, meet with students individually before they begin planning to review essential considerations for the literary argument essay.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.C.10, 8.I.C.11, and 8.I.C.12.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizers to ensure that students are developing coherent arguments with main claims supported by evidence and reasoning.

- As time allows, consider meeting with each student during the planning time for a 1-minute conference to monitor understanding and offer support.

Down the Road

- In Unit 3, students will read more supplemental texts about Japanese American internment, eventually extracting from them overarching lessons learned from this dark time in history. These lessons will inform student work on the performance task in the second half of Unit 3.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Gather devices for students who prefer to plan their essays using a computer or tablet. Ensure devices are logged in and in good working order.

- Prepare copies of the Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer for students (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time A: Students who struggle to remain focused may benefit from breaking up the planning time into smaller chunks. Use an online timer to set smaller increments, perhaps 5 minutes, and give students one discrete task to focus on during each 5-minute interval (e.g., including context in the introduction or developing a counterclaim).

- Work Time A: Students may prefer to type their responses for the Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer. Provide devices with word-processing software, if available.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.8.1a (5 minutes)

- Tell students that they will now plan their independent argument essays. These will be written in the following lesson, during the End of Unit 2 Assessment.

- Display the prompt for the independent argument essays: Choose a significant idea from the text *Farewell to Manzanar*. How effectively does the film *Farewell to Manzanar* convey this significant idea?

- Turn and Talk:

“How is this prompt similar to the prompts of the model and practice essays? How is it different?” (All three prompts have the same core question, though all focus on a different significant idea. The model and practice essays had the significant idea chosen ahead of time; the independent essays allow students to choose the significant idea they wish to focus on.)

- Direct students to retrieve their **Compare** **Text** **to** **Film**: ***Farewell to Manzanar* note** - **catchers**. Focus their attention on the third question of the tables’ right-hand columns: “How do these moments help convey a significant idea in the text?” Refer to **Compare** **Text** **to** **Film**: ***Farewell to Manzanar* note** - **catchers** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as needed.

- Say:

“Review your answers to this question across your note-catcher. Note the significant ideas from the text that have been conveyed in the film. Which one of these significant ideas will inform the most meaningful independent argument essay? Remember that your goal is to make an argument about how effectively a significant idea is conveyed in the film. You may wish to focus on a significant idea that you see conveyed very effectively in the film; alternatively, you may wish to focus on a significant idea that you see conveyed less effectively. Whatever you decide, remember you have to use evidence from the text and film to support your claim.”

- Give students a few minutes to select the significant idea that will serve as the focus of their independent argument essays. They may also wish to refer to the **Significant** **Ideas** **anchor** **chart**. Remind them that they cannot work with the significant ideas of the model or practice essays: *Jeanne’s* *youth* *impacts* *her* *understanding* *of* *events* *in* *the* *text* and *Papa* *feels* *deeply* *conflicted* *loyalties*, *both* *to* *Japan* *and* *to* *America*. However, they can use their model and practice essays for guidance with structure on this essay.

- Students can use their notes and selections to draft the main claim. As time allows, invite students to turn to an elbow partner to share their claims.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Plan an Argument Essay – RL.8.7, W.8.1, W.8.4 (35 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can plan an argument to support a claim with clear reasons and relevant evidence.”

- Distribute the **Argument** **Essay** **Writing** **Plan** **graphic** **organizer**. Tell students that will plan their essay on their graphic organizer and then use it to help them draft their essays in the following lesson.

- Display the **Characteristics** **of** **Argument** **Writing** **anchor** **chart**. Remind students to refer to the anchor chart as they are planning their argument essays to ensure they are meeting the criteria.

- Remind students that because these planners are meant to support students as they write independent essays in the following lesson, students should complete their planners independently and in silence.

- Focus students on the **Work** **to** **Become** **Effective** **Learners** **anchor** **chart**, and review perseverance and what it looks and sounds like. Remind students that as they examine the evidence they have collected and plan their essays, they may need to practice perseverance.

- Invite students to retrieve the following materials to support their planning and writing:

- Compare Text to Film: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catcher

- **Connections** **and** **Distinctions**: ***Farewell to Manzanar* note** - **catcher**

- **Argument** **Writing** **checklist**

- **Model** **Argument** **Essay**: “ **How** ***Farewell to Manzanar* Conveys** **Jeanne’s** **Youth** ”

- Students should also refer to Significant Ideas anchor chart as needed as they plan their essays. They may also find it useful to revisit their **Practice** **Argument** **Essay** **Writing** **Plan** **graphic** **organizers** from Lesson 10 to remind themselves of how to most effectively fill out the graphic organizers.

- Circulate to support students as they plan. If necessary, deepen students’ thinking by asking questions such as the following:

“What evidence do you have for this point?”

“How does that evidence support your point?”

“How does that point support your claim?”

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time A, encourage students who need lighter support to revisit and polish the sentences they produced during the Practice sections of the Language Dives and Mini Language Dives of Lessons 12, 15, and 16. Encourage students to incorporate these sentences into their planners for use in the independent argument essays that they write during the End of Unit 2 Assessment in the following lessons.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time A, work with students who need heavier support to help them revise the sentences they produced during the Practice sections of the Language Dives and Mini Language Dives of Lessons 12, 15, and 16. Encourage students to use these sentences as “checkpoints” around which the remainder of their essay can be built.

- After Work Time A, if students participated in individual writing check-ins to discuss their informative essays in Unit 2, Lesson 11, host follow-up sessions as time allows. During these meetings, work with students to reflect on the strengths and areas of possible growth that they identified earlier in the module. Help students refine action plans for writing the End of Unit 2 Assessment essay. This process supports a growth mindset for developing writers and facilitates opportunities for students to take charge of their own learning.

Work Time

B. Debrief: Argument Writing Checklist – W.8.1c, L.8.6 (5 minutes)

- Invite students to retrieve their copy of the Argument Writing checklist. Point out the following characteristic on the checklist:

- W.8.1c, L.8.6: “I use words and phrases that show how my claim, counterclaims, reasons, and evidence are related.”

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What words and phrases might be useful for showing the relationships between claims and reasons? Claims and counterclaims? Reasons and evidence?”

- Give students a few moments to add these words and phrases to their planners.

- Invite students to reflect on the habit of character focus in this lesson, perseverance, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.
