Page 104 Sentence Chunk Chart

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

Late afternoons, practicing my baton in the firebreak, **angrily I would throw him into the air and watch him twirl,** and catch him, and throw him high, again and again and again. (from page 104 of *Farewell to Manzanar* by Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston and James D. Houston)

Launch

Invite students to reread the last paragraph of page 104 in *Farewell to Manzanar*. This paragraph contains important context about Papa that will help students understand figurative language, a connection, and Jeanne’s point of view conveyed in this sentence.

Late afternoons, practicing my baton in the firebreak,

Deconstruct

- **practicing my baton in the firebreak,**

“Can you find the participle adjective phrase in this chunk?” (Practicing my baton in the firebreak,. \[participle phrase; adjective\])

- As needed, remind students that they worked with participle phrases in Language Dives and Mini Language Dives in Unit 1.

“Whom does this participle adjective phrase describe? What in this chunk makes you think so?” (Jeanne. The word my tells us it is about the narrator, whom we know is Jeanne.)

- **firebreak**

“Can you figure out the part of speech and meaning of firebreak? What clues help you to determine this?” (We can use the meaning of the words fire and break to guess that this word means something that breaks or stops fire. A firebreak is open land that keeps fire from spreading. \[noun\])

- Students can use a dictionary to verify the precise meaning of **firebreak**.

- Students can sketch what they think a **firebreak** looks like on their note-catcher.

angrily I would throw him into the air and watch him twirl,

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- **him**

“What or whom does him refer to in this chunk? How do you know?” (It refers to <u>both</u> Papa and Jeanne’s baton. The first chunk tells us that Jeanne is practicing her baton, and we know that a baton is thrown into the air. Meanwhile, earlier information in the paragraph tells us that Jeanne is also talking about Papa, and we know that him is a word that refers to an animate object. \[pronoun\])

- Tell or remind students that when a writer gives an inanimate object human qualities, he or she is using a type of figurative language called **personification**. This is a type of metaphor. Refer to students to the Authors’ Methods anchor chart, as needed, to revisit the definition of **metaphor**, and to add this chunk as an additional example.

“What connection or distinction are the authors making by using this method?” (They are making a connection, through comparison, between Papa and Jeanne’s baton.)

- **would**

“Can you figure out why the writers use would?” (to convey that Jeanne threw and watched her baton twirl repeatedly or habitually in the past \[modal verb used to express a past habitual action\])

“How would the meaning of this chunk be different if the writers had used the simple past tense of throw and watch instead of the modal would?” (It would mean that Jeanne had only thrown and twirled her baton once in the past rather than repeatedly.)

- **Students can use Conversation Cues as they discuss. To provide heavier support, display a suggested sequence, such as the one below:**

- Goal 1: Let’s take time to think and write or sketch.

- Goal 1: Can you give an example?

- Goal 2: Who can repeat what they said?

- Goal 4: Who can explain why they came up with that response?

- Students can list and provide examples for other uses of **would** that they know.  Step 4

- If available space allows for doing so safely, students can construct a baton from a piece of paper and angrily throw it in the air and watch it twirl to demonstrate and internalize the meaning of this chunk.

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Students can use this sentence frame to practice using **would** to convey a repeated, habitual action in the past.

“Last summer, happily I \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.”

(Last summer, happily I <u>would sleep until noon</u>.)  Step 5

- To provide lighter support: “How would this sentence be different if we used an adverb like **often** or **always** instead of **would** to talk about a past habitual action?”

- To provide heavier support: Invite students to discuss the meaning of the sentence in home-language groups. Add the verbs in students’ home languages to the Parts of Speech anchor chart.

and throw him high, again and again and again.

Deconstruct

- **again and again and again**

“Why do you think the writers use the word again <u>three</u> times?” (To emphasize that Jeanne angrily threw and watched her baton twirl many times, over and over. This is particularly effective because the word again means that something is repeated. \[adverb\])

Late afternoons, practicing my baton in the firebreak, angrily I would throw him into the air and watch him twirl, and catch him, and throw him high, again and again and again.

Reconstruct

- Ask:

“What does the connection the writers make in this sentence tell us about Jeanne’s point of view toward Papa?” (It tells us that Jeanne is angry with Papa, and perhaps that she wants to send him away from herself \[like throwing a baton\] and watch him struggle \[like a baton twirling in the air\].)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question:  
What are the main lessons that can be learned from Japanese American internment?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to identify that internment created great stress for people and tragically affected family relationships.)

Practice (Sentence)

- Students can complete the sentence frame to talk about how the Houstons use authors’ methods in the text to make connections.

> “In the text, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, skillfully, the Houstons \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.”
>
> participle phrase verb phrase with **would**
>
> (In the text, <u>using authors’ methods like personification</u>, skillfully, the Houstons <u>would make connections between ideas, events, and individuals</u>.)  Step 6

- To provide lighter support: “What if we divide this sentence into two or more sentences? What do we have to remove or change?”

- To provide heavier support: Invite students to discuss the meaning of the sentence in home-language groups. Add the nouns in students’ home languages to the Parts of Speech anchor chart.
