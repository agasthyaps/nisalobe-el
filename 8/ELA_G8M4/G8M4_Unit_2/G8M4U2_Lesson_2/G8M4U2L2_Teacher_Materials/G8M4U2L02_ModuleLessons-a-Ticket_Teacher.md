(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Reread an excerpt from chapter 12 of *Farewell to Manzanar*, starting on page 92  
(at “All the class pictures are in there . . .”) and ending at the end of the chapter on page 92. Then, answer the questions below.

What point of view toward the experience of living at Manzanar does the yearbook convey? What evidence helps to convey that point of view?

Responses will vary, but may include: The yearbook conveys the point of view that Manzanar provided the same positive school experience the students would have otherwise experienced. The photos included show a pleasant place, even if the landscape seems remote, where every possible activity was happening and life was normal and happy. They do not include “the wire,” and they show people at ease and comfortable.
