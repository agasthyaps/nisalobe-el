Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.8.6 – Opening A: On an entrance ticket, students determine the authors’ point of view and how it differs from another point of view in chapter 12 of *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- RI.8.6 – Work Time A: Students determine points of view and how they are conveyed in chapter 13 of *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- RI.8.3 – Work Time B: Students participate in a Language Dive to explore a connection the writers make between Jeanne’s baton and Papa.

- RI.8.6 – Work Time B: Students participate in a Language Dive to consider Jeanne’s point of view toward her father.

- L.8.5a – Work Time B: Students participate in a Language Dive to interpret the use of figurative language.

- RI.8.3 – Closing and Assessment A: Students analyze how the text makes connections and distinctions between ideas in chapter 12 of *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- RI.8.3 – Closing and Assessment A: Students learn to analyze how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in chapter 13 of *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners by persevering to read independently and collaborating with peers to analyze the text.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- As students read and learn more about the events involved in Japanese American internment in *Farewell to Manzanar*, invite them to research particular aspects of this time period that are of interest to them, such as schooling or daily life in Japanese American internment camps or other experiences in other internment camps. Consider providing questions like the following to guide this exploration:

- Who were the key individuals involved? How are they connected? What distinctions are there between these individuals?

- What are the key ideas or events? How are these ideas or events connected? What distinctions are there between these ideas or events?

- Release more responsibility more quickly to students as they comprehend the tasks or concepts:

- Allow those students who are identifying the gist and other elements quickly the opportunity to develop their own text-dependent questions about the chapter, related to connections and distinctions as well as point of view. Ask these students to share their questions with the group as a way of generating discussion.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students have focused on analyzing *Farewell to Manzanar* for its connections and distinctions among individuals, ideas, and events. In this lesson, students will continue this analysis and also continue to analyze the authors’ point of view.

Support All Students

- Note that there is a differentiated version of the Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 2 used in Opening A in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- At this point, students should be reading the text independently. However, if some or all students need more support, read several pages aloud and then release students to read independently, in pairs, or in small groups. ▲

- Chapter 13 makes reference to a young man and woman in a romantic relationship going off into the bushes together. It also describes a woman in the camp as “overweight” and “heavy,” with “horseradish legs” (100–101). To support students in processing this content, ask: “What habit of character did you use as you read and discussed this chapter?” Students may need to draw on perseverance, empathy, and compassion as they read and discuss this content, being sensitive to their own and others’ reactions to the information presented.

- During the Language Dive in Work Time B, students may need additional support with understanding the concept of personification and how this type of figurative language is used in the Language Dive sentence to draw a connection between Jeanne’s baton and her father. Consider reviewing the Authors’ Methods anchor chart together as a class before beginning work in this Language Dive to set students up for success in analyzing this connection. ▲

- During the Language Dive in Work Time B, students may need to consult a dictionary to verify the meanings of words. Ensure students have access to a dictionary for this portion of the lesson. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson continues to incorporate familiar practices and reading strategies during the in-class reading of the text and support students in making connections in the text (RI.8.3) and in analyzing point of view. (RI.8.6) It also incorporates opportunities to collaborate with peers and includes a Language Dive that invites students to explore how the authors use a metaphor to make a connection between Jeanne’s baton and Papa. The Language Dive sentence also helps students to understand Jeanne’s point of view toward Papa. The Language Dive will help to prepare students for the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment, in which they will answer questions about how the authors of *Farewell to Manzanar* use figurative language to make connections and distinctions.

- ELLs may continue to find it challenging to identify connections, distinctions, significant ideas, and point of view in the text. Continue to help students to dissect individual sentences and language in the text, as well as the authors’ methods, as much as possible, to enable them to understand deeper connections and distinctions. Pair students strategically to ensure that ELLs have appropriate support from peers during collaborative activities.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.A.1, 8.I.A.2, 8.I.B.6, and 8.II.A.1.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Connections and Distinctions: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catcher to ensure students understand how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in *Farewell to Manzanar*.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will view the third segment of the film and analyze the extent to which the film stays faithful to or departs from the text as well as evaluating the choices made by the filmmakers.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.8.3, RI.8.6 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **2**, **Lesson** **2** or the optional **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **2**, **Lesson** **2** ▲. Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique to review their responses. Refer to **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **2**, **Lesson** **2** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- During Opening A, invite students who need heavier support to use Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 2 ▲. This resource includes sentence frames to help students organize and record their thinking.

Work Time

A. Read *Farewell to Manzanar*, Chapter 13 – RI.8.6 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze how the authors’ point of view is conveyed and differs from other points of view in chapter 13 of *Farewell to Manzanar*.”

- Repeated routine: Read chapter 13 in ***Farewell to Manzanar***. Use the **Text** **Guide**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** (**for** **teacher** **reference**) for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students who are ready to read independently or in small groups should be released to do so. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky** **notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary in their **vocabulary** **logs**, update the **Gist**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **anchor** **chart**, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Refer to the **Gist**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **anchor** **chart** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) and **Work** **to** **Become** **Ethical** **People** **anchor** **chart** as needed.

- If students do not finish reading the chapter within the allotted reading time, distribute **Synopsis**: ***Farewell to Manzanar,*** **Chapter** **13** to each student to review the key details from the chapter.

- Prompt students to Turn and Talk:

“What is the gist of chapter 13?” (Jeanne tries many activities: Glee Club, hiking, camping, baton twirling, Japanese dance, ballet, and studying Catholicism.)

- With students’ support, record the meanings of *subsided* (diminished, lessened), *vulnerable* (capable of being hurt), *geisha* (a Japanese woman trained as a performer), *rapt* (interested, absorbed), and *devastated* (broken, destroyed) on the **academic** **word** **wall**, with translations in students’ home languages. Write synonyms or sketch a visual above the words to scaffold students’ understanding. Invite students to record these words in their vocabulary logs.

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What is Jeanne’s point of view toward her teacher, Lois, the Odori teacher, and the ballet teacher, and how are those points of view conveyed?” (Responses will vary, but may include: Jeanne seems to have a more positive point of view toward the two Caucasian women \[teacher and Lois\] and a more negative point of view toward the two Japanese women \[Odori and ballet teacher\]. This is conveyed by her language and description. The Caucasian women are described as “the best teacher I ever had” and “pretty” whereas the descriptions of the Japanese women have more negative connotations, such as “mystery,” “old,” “occult,” “foreign,” “now overweight,” “sad to watch,” “hoisted,” “scared me away.”)

“What evidence from the text helps to convey that point of view?” (Responses will vary, but may include the evidence mentioned in the response above.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Work Time

B. Language Dive: *Farewell to Manzanar*, Page 104 – RI.8.3, RI.8.6 (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, events, and ideas in chapter 13 of *Farewell to Manzanar*.”

- Display the **Questions** **We** **Can** **Ask** **during** **a** **Language** **Dive** **anchor** **chart**. Ensure students understand how to use these questions, pointing out that the questions underlined on the anchor chart are questions that students should always ask when they dive into a sentence.

- Reread aloud the final paragraph on page 104 of *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- Focus students on the sentence below:

- “Late afternoons, practicing my baton in the firebreak, angrily I would throw him into the air and watch him twirl, and catch him, and throw him high, again and again and again.”

- Use the **Language** **Dive** **Guide**: ***Farewell to Manzanar***, **Page** **104** and **Language** **Dive**: ***Farewell to Manzanar***, **Page** **104** **Sentence** **Chunk** **Chart** (**for** **teacher** **reference**) to guide students through a Language Dive conversation about the sentence. Distribute and display the **Language** **Dive**: ***Farewell to Manzanar***, **Page** **104** **note** - **catcher** and the **Language** **Dive**: ***Farewell to Manzanar***, **Page** **104** **sentence** **chunk** **strips**. Refer to **Language** **Dive**: ***Farewell to Manzanar***, **Page** **104** **note** - **catcher** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- To extend work with the use of *would* to convey habitual actions in the past, after the Language Dive in Work Time B, invite students to look for other examples of *would* used in this way in sentences in chapter 13 of *Farewell to Manzanar*. Students can share these examples with classmates in small groups or discuss as a whole class.

For Heavier Support

- To extend work with the use of *would* to convey habitual actions in the past, after the Language Dive in Work Time B, display other examples of this form from chapter 13 of *Farewell to Manzanar* to highlight usage:

- “I would always take along a quart jar and a white handkerchief and sit for an hour next to the stream, watching it strain through the cloth, trickling under the glass” (95).

- “She would kneel in her kimono and speak very softly in Japanese, while her young assistants would gracefully swing closed knees or bend her swanlike neck to the old geisha’s instructions” (98).

Closing and Assessment

A. Analyze Connections and Distinctions: *Farewell to Manzanar*, Chapter 13 – RI.8.3 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, events, and ideas in chapter 13 of *Farewell to Manzanar*.”

- Ask students to retrieve their **Connections** **and** **Distinctions**: ***Farewell to Manzanar* note** - **catcher**.

- Direct students to work with a partner to complete at least one connection or distinction in the table for chapter 13 on the Connections and Distinctions: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catcher. Suggest that they revisit the point of view work from Work Time A to uncover one possible distinction and/or the Language Dive work in Work Time B for one possible connection. Remind them to use the **Authors’** **Methods** **anchor** **chart** as needed. Refer to the **Authors’** **Methods** **anchor** **chart** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as necessary.

- Using a total participation technique, such as **equity** **sticks**, call on a few pairs to share their explanations. Refer to **Connections** **and** **Distinctions**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **note** - **catcher** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**). As students share, be sure to unpack methods terms and definitions as needed and add examples for relevant methods used to the Authors’ Methods anchor chart. Refer to the Authors’ Methods anchor chart (example for teacher reference) as necessary.

- Draw students’ attention to the **Significant** **Ideas** **anchor** **chart**, and ask:

“What significant idea is conveyed by the distinction and connection in this chapter?” (Jeanne’s ambivalence toward her Japanese identity was increased and complicated by her experience at Manzanar.)

- Introduce the word *ambivalence* as needed to help students explain the tension Jeanne feels between the American and Japanese parts of her identity and how Papa feels in terms of his divided loyalties. Add *ambivalence* to the academic word wall, with translations in students’ home languages. Write synonyms or sketch a visual above the word to scaffold students’ understanding. Invite students to record the word in their vocabulary logs.

- Add the significant idea to the anchor chart. Refer to **Significant** **Ideas** **anchor** **chart** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Analyze Connections and Distinctions

- Students finish completing the Connections and Distinctions: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catcher for chapter 13 as needed.

B. Prepare for *Farewell to Manzanar* Film Viewing

- Students preview the prompts for Film Segment 3 on their **Compare** **Text** **to** **Film**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **note** - **catcher** and skim chapters 5, 8, 9, and 11 of *Farewell to Manzanar* to be better able to analyze how effectively the film conveys moments in Film Segment 3.
