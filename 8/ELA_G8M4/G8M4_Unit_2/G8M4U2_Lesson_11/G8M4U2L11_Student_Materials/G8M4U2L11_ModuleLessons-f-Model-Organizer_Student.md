**Name:** **Date:**

**Focus Prompt:** One significant idea in the text *Farewell to Manzanar* is that Jeanne’s youth impacts her understanding of events in the text. How effectively does the film *Farewell to Manzanar* convey this significant idea?

**Introduction**

How will you catch the reader’s attention? (Consider using facts, statistics, quotations or anecdotes.)

- **Use vivid and precise language.**

- **Include facts and descriptions of relevant events.**

What context about the text or topic does your reader need in order to make sense of the rest of your essay?

- **Jeanne and her role in the text**

- **Jeanne’s driving qualities, especially her youth**

- **The idea that internment is complex**

- **The significant idea and how it is conveyed in the text**

Main Claim: **By looking at key moments of the text and the film, we can see that the film *Farewell to Manzanar* effectively conveys this significant idea of Jeanne’s youth impacting her understanding of events.**

What are the two main points/reasons you will be offering to support this claim?

**The filmmakers’ choices in the moments when Jeanne is on the bus and when she asks about the meaning of *inu* faithfully capture the events, mood, or impact of the moments.**

Point/Reason 1:

**The filmmakers’ choices in the moment when Jeanne talks to a friend on the bus faithfully convey the idea that Jeanne is too young to understand the events of the text.**

Point/Reason 2:

**The filmmakers’ choices in the moment when Jeanne is talking to Mama about what it means to be an *inu* faithfully convey the idea that Jeanne is too young to understand the events of the text.**

Proof Paragraph(s) for Point 1

Point 1: What is the first point <u>from the text</u> you are offering to support your claim?

**In one important early moment from the text, Jeanne and her family are on the bus to Manzanar.**

Evidence: What evidence <u>from the text</u> supports this reason?

- **She is “full of excitement, the way any kid would be” (16).**

- **She tries to befriend the bus driver.**

- **She eagerly wants to look out the window.**

Reasoning: What reasoning develops your point and ties it back to the claim?

**Feeling excited shows how Jeanne’s naivete impacts her understanding of what awaits her and her family.**

Point 1: What is the first point <u>from the film</u> you are offering to support your claim?

**The filmmakers choose several techniques to capture this significant idea.**

Evidence: What evidence <u>from the film</u> supports this point?

- **They introduce a new character, another young girl on the bus.**

- **The two girls have a conversation about what to expect at Manzanar.**

- **Jeanne quickly and excitedly describes the “camp” that her Caucasian friends went to: swimming and hiking and sleeping outside was “really fun.”**

Reasoning: What reasoning develops your point and ties it back to the claim?

**The filmmakers’ use of characters, voice, and dialogue stays faithful to the ideas in the text; Jeanne is on the way to an internment camp, but does not fully understand what this means.**

Proof Paragraph(s) for Point 2

Point 2: What is the second reason you are offering to support your claim?

**The filmmakers’ choices in the moment when Jeanne is talking to Mama about what it means to be an *inu* faithfully convey the idea that Jeanne is too young to understand the events of the text.**

Point 2: What is the second point <u>from the text</u> you are offering to support your claim?

**In another important moment from the text, Jeanne tries to make sense of the word *inu*.**

Evidence: What evidence <u>from the text</u> supports this point?

- **Jeanne and Mama hear two women call Papa an *inu*, which means “dog” in Japanese.**

- **At the time, Jeanne thinks the women are just speaking badly about Papa “because he never socialized” (60).**

- **Years later, Jeanne would learn that “*inu* also meant collaborator or informer” (61) or traitor.**

Reasoning: What reasoning develops your point and ties it back to the claim?

**This distinction between Jeanne’s early and later knowledge of this word emphasizes all that Jeanne did not know while she was a child living at Manzanar.**

Point 2: What is the second point <u>from the film</u> you are offering to support your claim?

**In this moment in the film, the filmmakers use dialogue to convey Jeanne’s naivete and confusion.**

Evidence: What evidence <u>from the film</u> supports this point?

- **Departure from the text: Jeanne asks Mama what an *inu* is, and Mama answers in the moment.**

- **Mama says that “here, it means worse \[than ‘dog’\]: someone who helps the enemy.”**

- **The camera shows Jeanne looking up, clearly trying to make sense of what she is told.**

- **Jeanne asks, “Who is the enemy?”**

- **Mama is not able to provide an answer, suggesting that the answer is more complicated than Jeanne can comprehend.**

Reasoning: What reasoning develops your point and ties it back to the claim?

**Jeanne’s questions show the viewer that Jeanne does not fully understand what makes an *inu* or why Papa is being accused of disloyalty; Mama’s response shows there isn’t a simple answer to her naive question; dialogue allows film to remain faithful to the significant idea.**

**Counterclaim**

Counterclaim: What counterclaim might others raise to refute your claim?

- **Some might argue that the film does not effectively convey Jeanne’s youthful naivete and its impact on her understanding of events.**

- **Example: scene in book when Mama weeps at Papa’s arrest and Jeanne clings to her legs confused (very important in text to convey Jeanne’s youthful naivete) not included in film. Scene in film does not include Jeanne or show her bewildered reactions.**

Refute: How do you respond to this counterclaim?

- **This is a departure, but the details are in line with the significant idea.**

Reasoning: What reasoning supports your response?

- **Through this film scene, the viewer can better understand that Jeanne did not always know what was happening to the family. She was too young to be included in some situations and conversations about adult issues like Papa’s arrest.**

**Conclusion**

Briefly restate your main claim from the introduction:

- **All in all, the film effectively conveys the idea of Jeanne’s youth impacting her understanding of events.**

What are your further reflections on this topic?

- Why does this argument/claim matter?

- What would happen if this claim were not acted upon?

- Who is likely to benefit from this?

> **Claim matters because it is important that film helps viewers understand the complicated and often bewildering experience of Manzanar.**
