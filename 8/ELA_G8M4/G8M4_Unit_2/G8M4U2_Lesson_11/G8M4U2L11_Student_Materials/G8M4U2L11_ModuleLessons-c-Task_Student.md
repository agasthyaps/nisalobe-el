This idea is significant because it contributes to a deeper understanding of the text overall. You have uncovered this significant idea through a close analysis of scenes, connections, and distinctions across the text.

In bringing *Farewell to Manzanar* from its pages to the big screen, the filmmakers make a variety of choices. These choices may, or may not, lead to an effective presentation of significant ideas from the text.

With a partner, you will write an argument essay to state and support your answer to the following question: How effectively does the film *Farewell to Manzanar* convey the significant idea that Papa feels deeply conflicted loyalties, both to Japan and to America?

You will create a plan for the practice essay during Lesson 11, and have time to write the essay in pairs during Lessons 12–16.
