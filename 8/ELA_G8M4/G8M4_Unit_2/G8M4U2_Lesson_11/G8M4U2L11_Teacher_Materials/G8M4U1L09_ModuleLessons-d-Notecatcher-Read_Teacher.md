**Directions:** In this close read, you will work with a partner to discuss and answer the questions to help yourself deeply understand this important chapter.

Turn and Talk with your partner before writing to answer each question.

1.  If you were filming this part of the conversation between Papa and the interrogator, what tone of voice would you have Papa use?

Responses will vary, but students should note that Papa seems very sure of himself in all his answers. He shows his knowledge of both fishing and ocean travel. He is not rude, but he does not defer to the interrogator.

2.  Answer Part A, then answer Part B and Part C.

**Part A**

What does this conversation show about Papa’s feelings/ideas about the war?

Responses will vary, but students should note that Papa feels very critical of the military of both countries. He is sad about the war.

**Part B**

What do you think Papa means when he says, “Yes, it is still my country”?

He means that even though he thinks the Japanese military is wrong, he still loves Japan as his country.

**Part C**

Why does Papa’s answer about Japan being his country seem to be so important to the interrogator? What distinction are the writers drawing between Papa and the interrogator?

This is the reason Papa is here, to determine where his loyalty as a person of Japanese descent lies. The interrogator’s job is to find out if Papa will support America or Japan in the war.

3.  Answer Part A, then answer Part B and Part C.

**Part A**

What does the number of questions Papa asks show about who is controlling the conversation at this point? How does this support what we know about Papa?

Papa is very sure of his ideas and values. He knows what he thinks and

seems to have thought about his situation a lot.

**Part B**

What does the conversation show us about the distinction between Papa and the interrogator?

As a person of Japanese descent, Papa has no rights as a citizen, even though he has been in America for many years longer than the interrogator. The interrogator, in contrast, is a full American. He does not have to worry about belonging to this country, as Papa does.

**Part C**

Why is this distinction important for the story?

It reminds us what a difficult position Papa is in. It even reminds us what a difficult position all the internees are in.

4.  As you know, often in life feelings are not simple, and people have what we call “conflicted feelings” about something. When this happens, a person can feel two very different feelings about something at the same time.

How is Papa’s last statement here an example of conflicted feelings?

Papa feels two opposite ways. He loves America, and he also loves Japan.

5.  Remember, people sometimes use analogies to make their thinking clear. An analogy makes a connection between two ideas that are similar in some way.

**Part A**

Why do you think Papa uses the analogy of a mother and a father here? What does this analogy show about Papa’s feelings about both America and Japan?

Just as he loves his parents equally, he loves his two countries equally and just wants them to stop fighting.

**Part B**

If you were filming this last statement of Papa’s, what tone of voice might you choose to have him use? What expression might you have on his face?

Responses will vary, but may include: sad, thoughtful, regretful.

6.  Why do you think the writers choose to end the chapter with this question of Papa’s? What significant idea do they want us to understand about Papa?

They want to leave us with the idea that Papa loves both Japan and America, and that this war between them is very personally painful for him.
