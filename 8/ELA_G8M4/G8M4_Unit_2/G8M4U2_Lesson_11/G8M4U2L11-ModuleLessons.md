Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- L.8.2c – Work Time A: Students complete an entrance ticket to practice and demonstrate their command of English spelling.

- W.8.1 – Work Time A: Students read the Practice Argument Essay directions and identify evidence that can be used to answer the prompt.

- W.8.4 – Work Time A: Students read the practice essay prompt and analyze the task’s purpose and intended audience, considering how they will organize their ideas to produce clear and coherent argument writing.

- R.8.1 – Work Time B: Students review their anchor texts and note-catchers from Units 1 and 2 to identify evidence that supports the prompt in their Argument Writing Practice Essay.

- W.8.1 – Work Time C: Students work in pairs to plan an argument supported by claims with clear reasons and relevant evidence.

- W.8.5 – Work Time C: Students work in pairs to plan a practice argument essay.

- In this lesson, students work to become effective learners, focusing on a goal within collaboration that will support their practice work as they plan their essay.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Students can generate arguments for other significant ideas developed in the film and text. Arrange an informal debate in which students can practice supporting arguments with evidence and reasoning as well as listening and considering differing positions.

- Challenge students to add a third point to support their arguments in the practice essay.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students analyzed the structure of a model argument essay using the Painted Essay® template. In this lesson, students choose specific content for each part of the structure as they create a plan for their practice essay. Students cite evidence from the anchor text and film to answer the essay prompt.

Support All Students

- For Lessons 11–16, students will work with the same partner on a practice argument essay. This requires a considerable amount of focused collaboration across many lessons. Make strategic grouping choices to ensure that all students, including ELLs, are supported in their pairs. Make sure that differences in language ability within partnerships are not so stark that one student entirely dominates the evidence-gathering and writing process. ▲

- Note there is a differentiated version of the Practice Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer used in Work Time C in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Varied approaches may be taken for the practice essay, depending on class makeup and needs. While the ultimate goal is for students to gain practice with the genre and deeper understanding of how to write an argument essay prior to the assessment, the way partners support each other can take on the needs of a particular class. Have students plan and write together, using their partners for oral rehearsal, feedback, or evidence gathering. Alternatively, consider having students write independently and engage in peer feedback. ▲

- Students who need more support in using the Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer can consult the Model Argument Essay and Model Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer to see how the organizer relates to and supports the writing of the essay. Guide students through this analysis with questions such as: What vivid and precise language did the writer use in the introduction to catch the reader’s attention? Which sentences in the introduction give context? Where is the evidence sandwich for each Proof Paragraph in both the model essay and the model planner? (Mark the bread/point, filling/evidence, and bread/reasoning on both documents.) Does the writer follow the planner for the counterclaim paragraph? What other sentences are in the conclusion of the essay that aren’t in the planner? What is the purpose of those sentences? ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson begins with an entrance ticket that reviews English spelling rules, pairs students to plan and write an argument essay in partners, and allows time for reflection and collaborative discussion. Students will be introduced to the Practice Essay task and begin working together to plan and outline an argument essay on a new topic. This collaborative work will prepare students to write an argument essay independently later in the unit.

- ELLs may find it challenging to condense their thoughts, articulate their ideas, and fill in all of the information on the Practice Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer ▲. Spend time discussing the assignment and prompt to ensure that students have a clear understanding of the task. Allow ample time for oral processing before students begin writing in their planners.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.C.10, 8.I.C.11, and 8.I.C.12.

Assessment Guidance

- Use the Grade 8 Writing Process checklist to assess students’ writing abilities in Work Time C (see the Tools page at http://eled.org/tools).

- In Work Time A, check for student understanding of the context and prompt in the practice essay directions. Use any misconceptions or common issues as teaching points in upcoming lessons when they write this essay in more detail.

- Throughout Work Time C, frequently review student work to ensure students are using the planning graphic organizer accurately. Use common issues as whole group teaching points.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will begin their practice essays on the way the film conveys Papa’s conflicted loyalties. They will use the criteria and plans they develop in this lesson to draft their practice essays in Lessons 11–16, which will prepare them to independently plan and draft a new argument essay in the end of unit assessment in Lessons 18–19.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.8.2c (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **2**, **Lesson** **11**.

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique to review their responses. Refer to **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **2**, **Lesson** **11** (**answers** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Introduce Practice Essay Prompt – W.8.1, W.8.4 (5 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can annotate and determine the gist of a practice essay prompt.”

- Explain to students that they will work in pairs to practice writing an argument essay and will write another essay independently for the end of unit assessment.

- Display and distribute **Practice** **Argument** **Essay** **directions**. Explain that this handout describes background on the essay topic, what their essay should include, and the resources they need to complete the task in the upcoming lessons.

- Read each section of the handout aloud, and instruct students to read along silently. Then, direct students to read the Practice Argument Essay directions once more, on their own.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What is the gist of the Practice Argument Essay directions?” (Students should identify that their practice essay refers back to their anchor text and the film version of Farewell to Manzanar. The essay examines the extent to which the film conveys Papa’s conflicted loyalties. The directions for the practice essay ask students to write an essay that explains how effectively the film conveys this significant idea from the text Farewell to Manzanar. They need to use at least two points to support the proposal, or claim, use evidence from both the text and film, and explain their reasoning. They should also write and refute a counterclaim.)

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What is the topic of the essay you will write? (Students should identify that their job is to write an essay that argues about how effectively the film conveys the significant idea from the text of Papa’s conflicted loyalties.)

- Using a total participation technique, invite responses from the group. Answer any questions, and clear up any misconceptions or concerns students have regarding the task.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Work Time

B. Identify Evidence in Text and Note-Catchers – RI.8.1 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify evidence that supports a claim.”

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What information does the prompt give us about the context of the practice essay?” (Responses will vary, but may include: the text develops the significant idea of Papa’s conflicted loyalties between Japan and America.)

“What additional context might the readers of this essay need?” (Responses will vary, but may include: information about who Papa is and the source of conflicted loyalties; Japanese American families like the Wakatsukis forced to live in internment camps during World War II; after the Pearl Harbor attack, the US government begins to view Japanese Americans with suspicion; the government unfairly believes that they might try to help Japan win the war against the United States; this was painful for people who felt connected to both countries.)

- Ask students to retrieve their copy of ***Farewell to Manzanar***, their **Compare** **Text** **to** **Film**: ***Farewell to Manzanar* note** - **catcher**, their **Connections** **and** **Distinctions**: ***Farewell to Manzanar* note** - **catcher**, and their **Close** **Read**: ***Farewell to Manzanar***, **Chapter** **7** **note** - **catcher** from Units 1 and 2. Display the **Significant** **Ideas** **anchor** **chart**, and for reference, have on hand the **Compare** **Text** **to** **Film** and **Connections** **and** **Distinctions** **note** - **catchers** (**examples** **for** **teacher** **reference**). Tell students that reviewing the text and note-catchers will familiarize them with the content and inform their practice essay work.

- Distribute **sticky** **notes**, and ask students to work with their collaborative essay partner to identify evidence in this section of text that is relevant to the significant idea that Papa feels deeply conflicted loyalties, both to Japan and to America. Direct students to capture their evidence on the sticky notes and check with their partner to ensure it is relevant to the significant idea.

- Ask students to share the evidence they selected and noted with their partner.

- Circulate as students share to support them in identifying relevant evidence. Prompt struggling students to support them in identifying evidence from the text, film, and note-catchers. Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Work Time

C. Plan Practice Argument Essay – W.8.5 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can use my understanding of the elements of an argument essay to create a plan for a practice essay.”

- Display and distribute the **Practice** **Argument** **Essay** **Writing** **Plan** **graphic** **organizer**.

- Remind students that they used a similar graphic organizer to plan their argument essays in Module 2, Unit 3. Review each section, asking volunteers to explain what kind of information they will write in each section. Focus especially on the Proof Paragraph sections, explaining that since in each Proof Paragraph students will provide evidence from the text and then evidence from the film, the Proof Paragraph sections look a little different. Note that there are places for students to write a point about the text, evidence from the text, and reasoning about that evidence. Then there are places for students to write how that point is treated in the film, evidence from the film, and reasoning about that evidence. Remind students that in the last lesson they noted that the evidence in each Proof Paragraph came first from the text, then from the film. On the Practice Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer, there is a place to include evidence from both the text and the film. There is also a place to plan the reasoning about why each chunk of evidence supports the claim. Remind students that in the argument essay they wrote in Module 2, they used the term *evidence* *sandwiches*. In this argument essay, there will be double-decker evidence sandwiches in each Proof Paragraph (one evidence sandwich for the text evidence and one evidence sandwich for the film evidence. Inform students that in Lesson 13, they will more closely explore the evidence sandwiches in the Model Argument Essay: “How *Farewell to Manzanar* Conveys Jeanne’s Youth.”

- For ELLs and students who require additional support, the **Practice** **Argument** **Essay** **Writing** **Plan** **graphic** **organizer** ▲ can be used to help guide students’ thinking with prefilled information.

- If necessary, to further support students in using the planner, display the **Model** **Argument** **Essay**: “ **How** ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **Conveys** **Jeanne’s** **Youth** ” and the **Model** **Argument** **Essay** **Writing** **Plan** **graphic** **organizer** to show how the organizer relates to and supports the writing of the essay. Guide students through this analysis with questions such as the following. ▲

- What vivid and precise language did the writer use in the introduction to catch the reader’s attention?

- Which sentences in the introduction give context?

- Where are the two evidence sandwiches for each Proof Paragraph in both the model essay and the model planner?

- Does the writer follow the planner for the counterclaim paragraph?

- What other sentences are in the conclusion of the essay that aren’t in the planner? What is the purpose of those sentences?

- Display the **Characteristics** **of** **Argument** **Writing** **anchor** **chart**.

- Ask:

“What is the difference between planning an informative essay and an argument essay?” (The focus statement in an argument essay is called a *main claim*; the elaboration in the argument essay will connect the evidence to the points given for supporting the proposal, so it is called *reasoning*; argument essays contain a counterclaim paragraph.)

- Explain to students that they will use the Practice Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer to plan their essay. In this lesson, they will roughly sketch out what will go into each paragraph. In the upcoming lessons, they will have more time to add details to this graphic organizer as they plan and draft their practice argument essay.

- Tell students that as they plan, they should remember to support their ideas with information from the text and film versions of *Farewell to Manzanar*, going back into the text and note-catchers as needed.

- Release students who are ready to complete the collaborative planning independently.

- Draw the attention of students who need more support to the focus question section at the top of the Practice Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer. Ask students to copy the focus question from the Practice Argument Essay directions to this space. Refer to **Practice** **Argument** **Essay** **Writing** **Plan** **graphic** **organizer** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) for sample responses.

- Prompt students to Turn and Talk with their partners, allowing time for students to fill in the appropriate sections of their graphic organizers:

“What is the main claim of your argument?” (Responses will vary, but should convey either that the film does or does not effectively convey the significant idea.) If students need additional support, ask: “Based on the evidence you reviewed in the text and note-catchers, does the film effectively convey Papa’s conflicted loyalties or not?” ▲

“What context or background information will you need to give readers so they can understand this claim? Consider terms your readers might need to have defined.” (Responses will vary, but should include mention that the Wakatsukis were one of many Japanese American families forced to live in an internment camp during World War II; after the Pearl Harbor attack, the US government began to view Japanese Americans with suspicion; the government unfairly believed that they might try to help Japan win the war against the United States.)

- Refer to Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer (example for teacher reference) for sample responses.

- As students plan, circulate and ensure they understand the prompt and the main claim given in the directions.

- Distribute **colored** **pencils**, and invite students to use them to underline their main claim with the correct color: green.

- Direct students to the section of their Practice Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer where it asks: “What are the two main reasons or points you will be offering to support this claim?”

- Explain that in an argument essay, it is important to identify valid and compelling reasons or points that support the main claim. If students struggle to understand the concept of points, prompt students to consider times in their own lives when they gave points to support an argument. Remind students what the points look like in the Model Argument Essay: “How *Farewell to Manzanar* Conveys Jeanne’s Youth”: they are the scenes from the text.

- Ask students to brainstorm with their partner to generate potential points that would emerge from the evidence and support their claim. Give students time to briefly discuss and brainstorm with one another.

- As students discuss, chart or record any ideas they come up with.

- Direct students to write the points down on their planning document, and reiterate that the rest of their planning for their essay should be aligned to these points.

- Release students to complete the rest of their Practice Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizers in pairs. Remind students that they should use evidence from the text and film of *Farewell to Manzanar* for examples to explain their points. Also, explain that students don’t need to write in complete sentences in their graphic organizer. They can just take notes.

- Circulate to support students as they plan. Refer to Practice Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer (example for teacher reference) as needed. If necessary, prompt by asking questions such as the following:

“Which moments from the text and film show Papa’s conflicted loyalties?”

“How faithful to the text are those moments in the film? If the details differ, is the significant idea still conveyed?”

- Assure students that they will have more time to add detail to this plan as they work to write each paragraph in the piece over the next few lessons. Refer to the **Annotated** **Practice** **Argument** **Essay** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target and the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time C, before students begin planning their partner essays, have them fill out the Practice Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer for Model Argument Essay: “How *Farewell to Manzanar* Conveys Jeanne’s Youth.” This will give students the opportunity to further dissect the structure, content, and argumentation of this model essay, which will help students to better understand how to plan and organize their own essay on a new topic.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time C, invite students who need heavier support to use the Practice Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer ▲. This resource features prefilled information to guide students through the planning process. Working with this differentiated version of the graphic organizer will set students up for success in planning their independent essays on the End of Unit 2 Assessment.

- After Work Time C, If it is feasible to do so, host individual writing check-ins with ELLs to discuss the planning they have done for their practice essays. During these meetings, work with students to identify their strengths, as well as pinpoint areas of possible growth. Help students develop action plans for working on the essay. Plan to meet with students again at the end of the module to track their progress. This process supports a growth mindset for developing writers and facilitates opportunities for students to take charge of their own learning.

Closing and Assessment

A. Reflect on Learning (5 minutes)

- Organize students into groups of three or four, and have them read the **Work** **to** **Become** **Effective** **Learners** **anchor** **chart**.

- Ask students to Turn and Talk in their groups about successes and challenges they had working collaboratively in the class session.

- Use the following Goal 3 Conversation Cues as appropriate to prompt discussion:

“Why do you think that?”

“What examples from today’s class makes you think so?”

- Prompt students to create a goal for the next class session regarding effective collaboration. Direct students to share these with their groups.

- Call on students to share their goals for the next lesson and reflect on any changes they may need to make in order to meet these goals.

For Lighter Support

- As students reflect on their learning, ask them to paraphrase a partner’s contribution to the discussion using appropriate Conversation Cues. This will help to reinforce both the content and purpose of the discussion and will provide students with additional practice in reframing information in their own words, a skill that they will also apply as they cite evidence in their essays.

For Heavier Support
