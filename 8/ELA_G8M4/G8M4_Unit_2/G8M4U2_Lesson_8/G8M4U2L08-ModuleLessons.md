Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.8.3 – Opening A: Students analyze how the connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events convey significant ideas in *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- RI.8.6 – Work Time A: Students determine authors’ point of view in chapter 22 and the afterword of *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- RI.8.3 – Work Time B: Students analyze how the connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events convey significant ideas in *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- W.8.10 - Closing and Assessment A – Students QuickWrite in response to one of the given questions on an exit ticket.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners by persevering to read independently and collaborating with peers to analyze the text.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Standard RI.3 in Grades 9–10 requires students to analyze how an author unfolds a series of ideas or events, including the order in which the points are made, how they are introduced and developed, and the connections that are drawn between them. Have students analyze how the Houstons unfold a series of ideas or events in chapter 22 or the afterword, examining the order of the events and ideas, how they are introduced and developed, and the connections between them. Students can create a flowchart of their analysis and share it with their classmates.

- As students read and learn more about the events involved in Japanese American internment in *Farewell to Manzanar*, invite students to research particular aspects of this time period that are of interest to them, such as other post-internment experiences or the Houstons’ other books. Consider providing questions like the following to guide this exploration:

- Who were the key individuals involved? How are they connected? What distinctions are there between these individuals?

- What are the key ideas or events? How are these ideas or events connected? What distinctions are there between these ideas or events?

- As appropriate, suggest that students reread the afterword and conduct research to determine whether they would agree with the Houstons’ perspective that the government and media have learned to respond better since 1942 and since 2001.

- Release more responsibility more quickly to students as they comprehend the tasks or concepts.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students completed the mid-unit assessment, which focused on analyzing point of view; the connections and distinctions among individuals, ideas, and events; and significant ideas conveyed in the text. In this lesson, students finish the anchor text and reflect on the significant ideas.

Support All Students

- At this point, students should be reading the text independently. However, if some or all students need more support, read several pages aloud and then release students to read independently, in pairs, or in small groups. ▲

- Chapter 22 describes Papa driving drunk and recklessly. To support students in processing this content, ask: “What habit of character did you use as you read and discussed this chapter?” Students may need to draw on perseverance, empathy, and compassion as they read and discuss this content, being sensitive to their own and others’ reactions to the information presented.

- As in previous lessons, in Work Time A, present additional options for recording gist rather than just the sticky note, such as using a separate notebook, using a graphic organizer, using highlighters and annotating, or using a voice recorder. Give students options for expressing their understanding of gist (oral, written, or drawing). Also, build in different options for expressing comprehension of the text (written reflection, voice recording, or discussion with partners/groups). ▲

- Incorporate a mix of processing opportunities after reading, including writing reflections and small group and whole class discussion. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson supports students in reading the final chapters of *Farewell to Manzanar* and to continue to track connections and distinctions and significant ideas in the text. In the Closing and Assessment of the lesson, students are given a choice of QuickWrite prompts designed to help them reflect on the experience of reading the text. This work supports students in synthesizing their learning through a complex text and serves to prepare them for the work ahead in the second half of the unit, in which they will write a literary argument essay that centers on how the film adaptation of *Farewell to Manzanar* conveys a significant idea from the text.

- ELLs may find it challenging to answer the open-ended questions during the QuickWrite exit ticket in the Closing and Assessment of the lesson. As time allows, build in space for discussion of each point before students write. This will help ELLs to formulate their ideas before writing and to carefully choose the question they would like to respond to. Meanwhile, it will also offer students a chance to consider their classmates’ perspectives to enrich their thinking.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6, 8.II.A.1, and 8.II.A.2.

Assessment Guidance

- This is the final reading lesson; this lesson also provides an opportunity for students to synthesize and reflect on their understanding of the text and its significant ideas. This will support them as they begin the argument writing in Lesson 9.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will watch the final segment of the film and continue their analysis on the Compare Text to Film note-catcher in preparation for the argument writing that comprises the remainder of the unit.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.8.3 (10 minutes)

- Draw students’ attention to the **Significant** **Ideas** **anchor** **chart**, and ask:

“Based on your work in the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment with the epigraph and excerpt of chapter 22, what significant ideas are conveyed by the distinctions and connections and by other understandings from the text? What do we need to add to our anchor chart, either as new significant ideas or as evidence for significant ideas we have already identified?” (Jeanne’s family found solace and the strength to survive by turning to nature and its lessons of endurance and patience; Jeanne’s youth impacts her understanding of events in the text; the effects and impact of being interned were experienced long after the closing of and departure from the camps.)

- Using a total participation technique, such as **equity** **sticks**, call on a few students to share their ideas and support for their ideas. As students share, add to the Significant Ideas anchor chart. Refer to **Significant** **Ideas** **anchor** **chart** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Remind students that they will finish reading the text in this lesson and then will finish the film in the next lesson.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read *Farewell to Manzanar*, Chapter 22 and Afterword – RI.8.6 (20 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze how the authors’ point of view is conveyed in Chapter 22 of *Farewell to Manzanar*.”

- Repeated routine: Read chapter 22 and the afterword in ***Farewell to Manzanar***. Use the **Text** **Guide**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** (**for** **teacher** **reference**) for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students who are ready to read independently or in small groups should be released to do so. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky** **notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary in their **vocabulary** **logs**, update the **Gist**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **anchor** **chart**, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Refer to the **Gist**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **anchor** **chart** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) and **Work** **to** **Become** **Ethical** **People** **anchor** **chart** as needed.

- If students do not finish reading the chapter within the allotted reading time, distribute **Synopsis**: ***Farewell to Manzanar,*** **Chapter** **22** **and** **Afterword** to each student to review the key details from the chapter.

- Prompt students to Turn and Talk:

“What is the gist of chapter 22?” (As an adult, Jeanne struggled to talk about Manzanar; when she does talk and visit the camp ruins, she can say farewell to the painful memories.)

“What is the gist of the afterword?” (According to the authors, the book relates to many readers for many reasons over the years: to Americans processing WWII in the ‘70s, to children or grandchildren of immigrants and marginalized young adults processing their experience in America, and to people processing the terrorist attacks of September 11.)

- With students’ support, record the meanings of *rekindled* (stirred up, excited), *defiance* (open resistance, disregard), *placator* (someone who calms or pacifies), *gaiety* (state of being joyous, cheerful), *resonance* (echo, relation), and *reprisal* (retaliation against a perceived enemy) on the **academic** **word** **wall**, with translations in students’ home languages. Write synonyms or sketch a visual above the words to scaffold students’ understanding. Invite students to record these words in their vocabulary logs.

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What is Jeanne’s point of view toward her father as conveyed by the final memory she shares at the end of chapter 22?” (Responses may vary, but will likely include: Jeanne seems to have a more positive point of view toward her father than she did during the rest of their time in camp. She sees a spark of rebellion and life in him that she hadn’t seen for a long time, and she seems to suggest this was an important moment for him, for her and her ambivalence about her identity, and for them as a family.)

“Jeanne has felt deep ambivalence about Papa throughout the book. How does she resolve those feelings here at the end of her story?” (Responses will vary, but may include: as shown in the moment when he drives drunk and “crazy” around the camp, Jeanne still sees her father’s flaws, but she recognizes his strengths, too, as she begins to feel some of his “bubbly sense of liberation” in his defiance of the imprisonment.)

“Why do you think the Houstons chose to end the book in this way?” (Responses will vary, but may include: resolving Jeanne’s ambivalence or showing a positive side to her father at the end of the book allows the Houstons to reinforce the significant ideas that internment changed her father and impacted her long after they left the camp, and yet the Wakatsukis survived and live on to retell this story so that others may learn about this dark time in history and its effects.)

“What is Jeanne’s point of view toward the modern world as conveyed in the afterword?” (Responses may vary, but will likely include: Jeanne seems to be ambivalent about the world she lives in as an adult. On the one hand, she sees signs of hope that the injustice experienced by Japanese Americans by being incarcerated might not be repeated. On the other hand, the events of 9/11 suggested there is the same fear and hatred just below the surface of modern life.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Work Time

B. Analyze Significant Ideas: *Farewell to Manzanar* – RI.8.3 (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze how the connections among and distinctions between individuals, events, and ideas in *Farewell to Manzanar* convey significant ideas and develop my understanding of the text.”

- Ask students to retrieve their **Connections** **and** **Distinctions**: ***Farewell to Manzanar* note** - **catchers**.

- Direct students’ attention back to the Significant Ideas anchor chart, and have them work with a partner to review their note-catchers and text for additional details from chapter 22 and the afterword that convey significant ideas. Students may draw on their Connections and Distinctions: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catchers for types of connections and distinctions they might identify that convey the significant ideas. They do not have to fill in the note-catcher in this lesson.

- Using a total participation technique, such as equity sticks, call on students to share their ideas. As students share, add to the Significant Idea anchor chart. To support students, ask:

“What significant ideas are conveyed in chapter 22 and the afterword? How are they conveyed? What details from the text convey those ideas?”, (Responses will vary, but may include: *The effects and impact of being interned were experienced long after the closing of and departure from the camps,* which is conveyed by details such as Jeanne took “twenty years to accumulate the confidence to deal with” her internment experiences \[167\] and still she knows that “the traces that remained would always remain, like a needle” \[177\]. *Jeanne’s family found solace and the strength to survive by turning to nature and its lessons of endurance and patience* which is conveyed by details such as Jeanne finding strength from the stones that people used to decorate their living spaces while imprisoned in Manzanar. *The idea of internment was created out of dangerous and unsupported assumptions*, which is conveyed by the details in the afterword about the connection between the causes of internment \[dangerous and unsupported assumptions as well as fear and hatred\] and many people’s response to the terrorist attacks of 9/11 \[to blame all Muslim Americans for the act of a few non-Americans\].)

- Refer to the Significant Ideas anchor chart (example for teacher reference).

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time B, for continued spiraling with language structures students have worked with in Language Dives (participles, passive voice, relative clauses, *would* as a way of conveying habitual action), as students prepare to finish the text, invite them to find an example of each of these forms in chapter 22 or the afterword. Students can discuss why the writers used these structures. This will help students to continue to expand their understanding of how language structure and meaning interact while also helping to engage with the content of the final chapters of the text through careful attention to language.

For Heavier Support

- Before students read chapter 22 and the afterword of *Farewell to Manzanar*, invite them to review the main events and significant ideas conveyed throughout chapters 1–21. Students can predict how they think the text might end and what significant ideas they expect to encounter as the text comes to a close.

Closing and Assessment

A. Exit Ticket – W.8.10 (5 minutes)

- Distribute and display the **Exit** **Ticket**: **Unit** **2**, **Lesson** **8**. Direct students to complete the question of their choice.

- As time allows, invite some students to share with the whole group or share with an elbow partner. Explain that they’ll revisit these responses as they begin work on their argument essays and at the end of the module during reflection. Collect, review, and retain the responses.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Prepare for *Farewell to Manzanar* Film Viewing

- Students preview the prompts for Film Segment 4 on their **Compare Text to Film: *Farewell to Manzanar*** **note-catcher** and skim chapters 8, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, and 22 of *Farewell to Manzanar* to be better able to analyze how effectively the film conveys moments in Film Segment 4.
