Chapter 22 and Afterword

**Name:** **Date:**

**Chapter 22 “Ten Thousand Voices”**

- Jeanne shares her perspective years later, as an adult.

- Jeanne becomes the first in her family to finish college and also the first in her family to marry someone who isn’t Asian.

- From time to time, Jeanne considers visiting Manzanar, but life is busy and she is afraid, in some ways, to return. Jeanne and her siblings have not spoken about Manzanar often over the years, and they didn’t share their experience with others, keeping it a secret because it was too painful.

- In 1966, Jeanne meets a Caucasian photographer who worked at Manzanar. Jeanne wants to talk about camp with her. From this point on, Jeanne is more comfortable talking about her experience.

- In 1972, Jeanne and her husband take their three children to visit Manzanar. The camp is abandoned, and only the warehouses remain.

- Being at the camp brings back memories and difficult emotions like shame and guilt in Jeanne. Seeing Manzanar makes Jeanne realize she no longer wants to erase it from her mind. Instead, she says: “Having found it, I could say what you can only say when you’ve truly come to know a place: Farewell” (176).

- Jeanne remembers a moment at the end of their time in Manzanar when Papa bought an old car and drove it around the camp, scaring Jeanne but also helping her feel some of his “defiant craziness” (183).

**Afterword**

- The book started as interviews between the authors. It was just going to be for Jeanne’s family.

- The audience has grown over the years. Audiences from different time periods have different reactions:

- Some 1970s readers compared Japanese American internment to military prisoners of war, but that is not a good comparison because the military prisoners were soldiers in a foreign land. The interned Japanese Americans were mostly US citizens, imprisoned in their own country by their own government.

- Over the years, children of immigrants see their parents or grandparents in Jeanne’s parents.

- Recently, readers of many backgrounds relate to the story of a young girl who is separated from society for reasons she doesn’t understand.

- After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the book shows how it is wrong to treat all people from a group as the same. In 2001, the media and government agreed this is wrong. In 1942, the media and government supported the wrongful imprisonment of Japanese American citizens. Still, we must remember the lessons learned from the book.
