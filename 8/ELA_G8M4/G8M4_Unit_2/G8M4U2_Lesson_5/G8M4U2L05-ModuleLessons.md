Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.8.3 – Opening A: Students analyze a distinction among ideas in an excerpt from the text.

- RI.8.6 – Opening A: Students use their understanding of a distinction made in the text to determine the narrator’s point of view in the text.

- RI.8.3 – Work Time A: Students analyze how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in chapters 19 and 20 of *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- RI.8.3 – Closing and Assessment A: Students identify the significant ideas conveyed in chapters 19 and 20 by details as well as connections or distinctions made among individuals, ideas, and events.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners by persevering as they read and analyze the complex anchor text.

- Chapter 18 of *Farewell to Manzanar* is not read in this curriculum due to time constraints.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Encourage students to read chapter 18 (skipped due to time constraints) and analyze it for connections and distinctions among individuals, ideas, and events to deepen understanding of the text.

- As students read and learn more about the events involved in Japanese American internment in *Farewell to Manzanar*, invite them to research particular aspects of this time period that are of interest to them, such as other experiences of post-camp life. Consider providing questions like the following to guide this exploration:

- Who were the key individuals involved? How are they connected? What distinctions are there between these individuals?

- What are the key ideas or events? How are these ideas or events connected? What distinctions are there between these ideas or events?

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students participated in a Jigsaw protocol to read chapters 14–17 of *Farewell to Manzanar*. Students analyzed their assigned chapters for meaningful connections and distinctions and shared their findings with classmates. Students complete similar tasks in this lesson, reading and analyzing distinctions and connections in chapters 19–20 in order to deepen understanding of the text.

Support All Students

- At this point, students should be reading the text independently. However, if some or all students need more support, read several pages aloud and then release students to read independently, in pairs, or in small groups. ▲

- The subject matter in chapter 20 includes descriptions of appearance, gender, and sexuality that may be seen as insensitive. For example, as Jeanne struggles to make sense of her identity in a post-internment world, she refers to herself as “the slant-eyed face, the Asian” (142). In a later passage, Jeanne describes her attitudes toward her maturing body and wonders “how an Asian female can fascinate Caucasian men” (147). Offer support as students process these problematic passages. Invite students to discuss their reactions aloud, practicing respect and empathy for one another’s feelings. Use point of view work to help students establish distance from the ideas presented in the text; by more directly assigning the text’s ideas to the individuals in the text, students can better balance an understanding of Jeanne’s attitudes with their own rejection of those attitudes.

- To support ELLs, this lesson follows a similar format to earlier lessons in which students engaged in supported in-class reading of text. Students will also continue to track connections and distinctions in the text and engage in collaborative exchange to work together to analyze these. During the Closing and Assessment of the lesson, students engage in further work with significant ideas in the text, building toward the second half of this unit, in which they will write a literary argument essay that focuses on how a significant idea from the text is conveyed in the film adaptation of *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- ELLs may find it challenging to balance work with connections and distinctions and significant ideas in this lesson. Help students to see the link between connections and distinctions and significant ideas by focusing attention on specific language in the text that reveals significant ideas through connections and distinctions. Pair students thoughtfully during partner work to ensure that ELLs are supported in analyzing information and language in the text.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.A.1 and 8.I.A.2.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Connections and Distinctions: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catcher to ensure students understand how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in *Farewell to Manzanar*.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue to read *Farewell to Manzanar*, chapter 21, and continue their work analyzing connections and distinctions and deepen their understanding of the text. Students will apply their learning to the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.8.3 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **2**, **Lesson** **5**. Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique to review their responses. Refer to **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **2**, **Lesson** **5** (**answers** **for** **teacher** **reference**). Students will need to refer to the **Significant** **Ideas** **anchor** **chart** to complete the entrance ticket.

- Using a total participation technique, invite students to share aloud their answers to the last question on the entrance ticket. Add new relevant evidence to the Significant Ideas anchor chart to support the idea that Jeanne’s ambivalence toward her Japanese identity was increased and complicated by her experience at Manzanar.

- Direct students’ attention to the **Work** **to** **Become** **Effective** **Learners** **anchor** **chart**, and tell students that the habit of character of focus for this lesson is perseverance as students read and analyze the complex anchor text. Students can also set personal goals to ensure continued effective perseverance in this lesson.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read and Analyze *Farewell to Manzanar*, Chapters 19–20 – RI.8.3 (35 minutes)

- Review the learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can determine the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary in chapters 19–20 of *Farewell to Manzanar*.”

“I can analyze how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, events, and ideas in chapters 19–20 of *Farewell to Manzanar* to develop my understanding of the text.”

- Repeated routine: Read chapters 19–20 in ***Farewell to Manzanar***. Use the **Text** **Guide**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** (**for** **teacher** **reference**) for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students who are ready to read independently or in small groups should be released to do so. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky** **notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary in their **vocabulary** **logs**, update the **Gist**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **anchor** **chart**, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Refer to the **Gist**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **anchor** **chart** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) and **Work** **to** **Become** **Ethical** **People** **anchor** **chart** as needed.

- If students do not finish reading the chapter within the allotted reading time, distribute **Synopsis**: ***Farewell to Manzanar,*** **Chapters** **19** – **20** to each student to review the key details from the chapter.

- Prompt students to Turn and Talk:

“What is the gist of chapter 19?” (The Wakatsukis return to California in a car Papa bought; they find an apartment in a housing project.)

“What is the gist of chapter 20?” (Jeanne starts school and faces racism when excluded from activities; she immerses herself in activities and befriends Radine, who sticks up for her.)

- With students’ support, record the meanings of *volition* (preference, choice, made of own will), *amorphous* (having no particular shape, changeable), *premonitions* (forewarnings, hunches, apprehensions), *guileless* (honest, straightforward, innocent), *intangible* (not definite or clear, abstract, unreal), and *gaudiness* (showy, cheap, tasteless) on the **academic** **word** **wall**, with translations in students’ home languages. Write synonyms or sketch a visual above the words to scaffold students’ understanding. Invite students to record these words in their vocabulary logs.

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“Consider the titles of each chapter. What do they suggest are the important events or ideas in the chapters?” (“Re-entry” suggests that the important events in chapter 19 are around the Wakatsukis returning to California and trying to start their life over again. “A Double Impulse” suggests that important ideas in chapter 20 are around Jeanne’s impulses to want to fit in to American society and her desire to disappear.)

- Ask students to keep these important events and ideas in mind as they identify significant connections and distinctions and how they deepen understanding of the text. Have students retrieve their **Connections** **and** **Distinctions**: ***Farewell to Manzanar* note** - **catchers**.

- Direct students to work independently (if they are ready) or in pairs to complete at least one connection or distinction in the tables for each chapter on the Connections and Distinctions: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catcher. Remind them to use the **Authors’** **Methods** **anchor** **chart** as needed. Refer to the **Authors’** **Methods** **anchor** **chart** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as necessary.

- Use a total participation technique to have students share the connections and distinctions they identified and their explanation. **Connections** **and** **Distinctions**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **note** - **catcher** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as needed.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Closing and Assessment

A. Significant Ideas: *Farewell to Manzanar*, Chapters 19–20 – RI.8.3 (5 minutes)

- Refocus the class on the Significant Ideas anchor chart. Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What significant ideas are conveyed in chapters 19 and 20? How are these ideas conveyed? What details, connections, or distinctions develop these ideas?” (Chapter 19: The connection between the cloud and hatred toward the Japanese is evidence of the significant idea that the effects and impact of being interned were experienced long after the closing of and departure from the camps. Chapter 20: The distinction between Woody and Papa upon their return to normal life is evidence of the significant idea that the effects and impact of being interned were experienced long after the closing of and departure from the camps; Jeanne’s determined attempts to live in the new world—trying to be American by baton twirling and joining clubs but not being fully accepted by her Caucasian peers nor her father because she is not Japanese enough.)

- Record student responses on the Significant Ideas anchor chart. See the Connections and Distinctions: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catcher (example for teacher reference) and the **Significant** **Ideas** **anchor** **chart** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) for more detailed explanations of these distinctions and connections and their relationships to significant ideas in the text.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, perseverance, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- Invite students to share what their partners say about significant ideas to promote attentive listening, retelling, paraphrasing, and peer language modeling. Since students are accustomed to sharing out their own answer, explain why this is helpful, and provide them with frames and a model first: “My partner (or name of student) said \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.”

For Heavier Support

- Have students sketch a visual representation of the significant idea that the effects and impacts of being interned were experienced long after the closing of and departure from the camps. This will help students to process and demonstrate their receptive understanding of the text in an asset-based way that doesn’t rely on speaking proficiency.

Homework

A. Analyze Connections and Distinctions

- Students finish completing the Connections and Distinctions: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catcher for chapters 19–20 as needed.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread chapter 21 of *Farewell to Manzanar* in preparation for studying the chapter in the next lesson.
