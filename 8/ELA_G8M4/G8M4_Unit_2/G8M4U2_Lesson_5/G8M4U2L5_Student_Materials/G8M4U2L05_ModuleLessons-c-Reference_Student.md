Synopsis: *Farewell to Manzanar*,  
Chapters 19–20

**Name:** **Date:**

**Chapter 19 “Re-entry”**

- As Jeanne’s family prepares to leave Manzanar, Papa decides that they should leave in style, so he buys a car.

- It takes the family four days and three trips to get all of Jeanne’s family and all of their belongings to Long Beach, California. On the way, the car keeps breaking down. Jeanne is hopeful they may get stranded and not have to continue on to Long Beach because she is afraid of the racism that waits for them there. But Papa is able to keep fixing problems with the car.

- Papa is drinking whiskey for most of the trip, but he sobers up when the family reaches the suburbs of Los Angeles, afraid of what they will find.

- Jeanne is frightened of the “hate” she has heard about from Mama and from the news, and like Papa, is worried about how people outside of the camps will feel and act toward Japanese Americans. However, once the family arrives in Los Angeles, they are surprised to find it quiet and pleasant.

- Jeanne and her family do not have anywhere to live in Long Beach, at first, but the American Friends Service helps them rent a three-bedroom apartment in the Cabrillo Homes housing project. The family has very little money and few belongings.

- Papa continues to talk about starting a housing cooperative for Japanese people returning from the camps and works on blueprints and other planning.

- Mama returns to working at a fish cannery and focuses on earning money for the family, but Papa does not take a job there because he is too proud.

- Jeanne’s fear and dread about the hate she might face from other people starts to go away, but this changes again when she begins public school.

**Chapter 20 “A Double Impulse”**

- Jeanne begins sixth grade at a new school. When she reads aloud during class, a blonde classmate tells Jeanne that she is surprised that Jeanne knows how to speak English. Jeanne is shocked that the girl would think this, and suddenly, she realizes that people won’t see her for who she really is because of her Japanese ancestry.

- Jeanne had never thought much about why she and her family were at camp, but the girl’s comments make her realize that people view Japanese Americans as outsiders. Jeanne thinks that the Japanese evacuation and internment caused America to stop seeing Japanese people as individuals. She also believes that the Japanese deportees allowed this to happen to some extent, believing that the treatment they received was deserved or allowable. She believes it’s easy for non-whites in America to think this way.

- Jeanne keeps herself busy with school activities like sports, yearbook, newspaper, and student government. She finds herself both wanting to disappear while also wanting to be accepted by her peers.

- Jeanne has a difficult time making friends, but she becomes friends with Radine, the blonde girl who insulted Jeanne on the first day of school. Jeanne decides she wants to join the Girl Scouts with Radine but is told that she is not allowed to become part of the group.

- Jeanne and Radine become close friends, and Radine sticks up for Jeanne when people are rude or mean to her. The girls become baton twirlers for the marching band together, and Jeanne begins to view her femininity in a new way and realizes that she can use it to gain acceptance.

- Papa wants Jeanne to stay connected to Japanese culture and traditions, but she is not interested in that. She begins to lose respect for Papa because he does not have a job and they still live in a small apartment. She also thinks he drinks too much and that he is resistant to letting go of his Japanese culture.

- Jeanne is embarrassed when Papa attends an event at her school dressed in a fancy suit and greets other parents with a traditional Japanese bow.
