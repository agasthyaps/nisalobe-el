RI.8.6

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Reread an excerpt from chapter 13 of *Farewell to Manzanar*, starting on page 102 at “This girl had already been baptized” and ending on page 103 at “‘. . . how are you going to find a good Japanese boy to marry?’” Then, answer the questions below.

What is Jeanne’s point of view toward Catholicism? How does she respond to Papa’s opposing viewpoint? Why does this matter?

Responses will vary but may include: Jeanne has a romantic, idealized point of view toward Catholicism. We know this because she thinks that the rituals and practices are beautiful. She looks on in “awe” and “startled wonder” at the orphan who looks like a “queen” in her confirmation dress (102). She is stunned and devastated at Papa’s opposing viewpoint. This matters because it reveals that Jeanne feels a different sense of responsibility to preserve her Japanese identity than Papa does.
