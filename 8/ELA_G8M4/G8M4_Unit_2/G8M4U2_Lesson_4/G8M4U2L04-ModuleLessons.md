Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.8.6 – Opening A: As part of the entrance ticket, students determine Jeanne’s point of view and analyze how she responds to Papa’s opposing viewpoint.

- RI.8.3 – Work Time A: During the Jigsaw protocol, students work with their expert groups to analyze how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in their assigned chapters of *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- RI.8.3 – Closing and Assessment A: Students share their jigsaw findings with their home groups, describing key connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in their assigned chapters.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become to become effective learners by collaborating during the Jigsaw protocol.

- Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning. The Jigsaw protocol is a particularly valuable tool for both supporting and pushing student learning because it (a) eases the reading load expected of each student, (b) creates opportunities for deeper, more focused analysis, (c) holds students accountable for their own learning by inviting them to report findings to classmates, and (d) is rooted in collaboration and co-construction of meaning.

- One of the challenges of a jigsaw is to ensure students understand all the important aspects of all the chapters. The homework prereading ensures initial comprehension of the chapters. Also, circulating in Closing and Assessment A to ensure thorough sharing and note-taking in the expert groups will ensure students understand the significant ideas developed in each chapter.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Chapter 16 of the text, read by group C during the jigsaw of Work Time A, describes several of the court cases brought against the internment camps. Consider extending instruction by inviting students to conduct further research into the three court cases described on pages 113–114. Students can analyze the arguments made against the internment camps and those made by the courts who chose to uphold the army’s decision to evacuate and intern Japanese Americans. To reinforce work with RI.8.9, students can identify where written arguments disagree on matters of fact or interpretation related to the issue of internment.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students determined how the authors of *Farewell to Manzanar* make connections among or distinctions between individuals, ideas, and events in chapters of the text. In this lesson, students continue this work through a Jigsaw protocol. They analyze the connections and distinctions made in their assigned chapters and then share their findings with classmates.

Support All Students

- Note that there is a differentiated version of Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 4 used in Opening A in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- During the jigsaw of Work Time A, groups A–D read chapters 14–17, respectively. As chapters 14 and 15 are shorter than chapters 16 and 17, consider assigning ELLs and other readers who need additional support to expert groups A and B. Reading and interpreting a shorter chapter will help students preserve the cognitive energy needed for a thorough analysis and presentation of the connections and distinctions that emerge in the chapter. ▲

- During the jigsaw, students will read their assigned chapter and then analyze the chapter within their expert groups. They will work with expert groups to make thoughtful and strategic choices about how to read the chapter together. If grouped students have a similar reading level and are comfortable reading independently, encourage them to read the chapter and record its gist silently before collaborating to add to their Connections and Distinctions: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catchers. If grouped students have disparate reading levels and would benefit from additional support, encourage them to designate a group member to read the chapter aloud while the others in the group follow along. ▲

- Strategically determine home groupings for Closing and Assessment A. If students need additional or heavier support, consider assigning expert-group partners to the same home group (e.g., AABCD). The two students can work together to explain the connections and distinctions of their assigned chapter to the other members of their home groups. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson uses a supported Jigsaw protocol to help students navigate four chapters of *Farewell to Manzanar*. Jigsaw reading supports ELLs because it cultivates content knowledge while limiting the amount of text each student is required to independently read and process. Reading with a clear purpose helps ELLs better differentiate between relevant and irrelevant information, reducing cognitive overload. Students will also continue to track connections and distinctions in the text and engage in collaborative discussion during all segments of the lesson.

- ELLs may find it challenging to comprehend their assigned jigsaw chapter in enough detail to be able to explain it to other members of their home groups during the jigsaw share. ELLs may also find it difficult to understand and absorb information about the chapters that their classmates have read from the text during this exchange. Encourage students to read all chapters discussed during the jigsaw at home, as time allows. Be prepared to provide additional support to struggling groups or add extra time, if possible. Focusing on vocabulary in advance of the activity can also help ELLs read more efficiently and comprehend more of the text.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.A.1, 8.I.A.2, and 8.I.B.6.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Connections and Distinctions: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catcher to ensure students understand how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- Monitor students’ progress during the jigsaw share of Closing and Assessment A to ensure that they are effectively presenting their group’s ideas and comprehending the ideas of other groups.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue to read *Farewell to Manzanar*, chapters 19–20, and continue their work in analyzing how connections and distinctions add to our understanding of the text. Students will apply their learning to the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Ensure there is a copy of Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 4 at each student’s workspace.

- Prepare students for the Jigsaw protocol:

- Review the Jigsaw protocol to ensure clear directions and smooth transitions.

- Strategically group students into home groups of four, and then assign each student in the home group a letter—A, B, C, or D. The lettered groups will be the expert groups during the jigsaw, with each expert group reading one of the four chapters from *Farewell to Manzanar*. Consider assigning readers who need heavier support to groups A or B (see Support All Students).

- Note that there should be no more than three or four students per expert group (e.g., AAAA, BBB), and that there will likely be more than one expert group for each chapter.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time A: If needed, use a video to model the Jigsaw protocol in action: http://eled.org/0122.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.8.6 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **2**, **Lesson** **4** or the optional **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **2**, **Lesson** **4** ▲. Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique to review their responses. Refer to **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **2**, **Lesson** **4** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**). Students will need to refer to the **Significant** **Ideas** **anchor** **chart** to complete the entrance ticket.

- Using a total participation technique, invite students to share aloud their answers to the last question on the entrance ticket. Add new relevant evidence to support a significant idea on the Significant Ideas anchor chart.

- Direct students’ attention to the **Work** **to** **Become** **Effective** **Learners** **anchor** **chart**, and tell students that the habit of character to focus on in this lesson is collaboration. As needed, invite students to share ideas about what effective collaboration looks and sounds like.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

For Heavier Support

- During Opening A, invite students who need heavier support to use Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 4 ▲. This resource includes sentence frames to help students organize and record their thinking.

Work Time

A. Jigsaw: *Farewell to Manzanar*, Chapters 14–17 – RI.8.3 (25 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, events, and ideas in chapters 14–17 of *Farewell to Manzanar* to develop my understanding of the text.”

- Explain that students will use the Jigsaw protocol to analyze connections and distinctions in chapters 14–17 of *Farewell to Manzanar*. Students will become an expert on one of the chapters, and then report their findings to classmates who read different chapters.

- Review the jigsaw procedure: Students have expert groups and home groups. They will first work with their expert groups to read and analyze a chapter of *Farewell to Manzanar*. Then, they will share what they learned with their home groups and also learn about the other groups’ chapters.

- Display expert group (e.g., AAAA, BBBB, CCCC, DDDD) and home group (e.g., ABCD) assignments. Have students move into their expert groups. Group(s) A will read chapter 14, group(s) B will read chapter 15, group(s) C will read chapter 16, and group(s) D will read chapter 17.

- Once students are settled in their expert groups, they can begin reading their assigned chapter with their classmates. Monitor the reading progress of the groups. Use the **Text** **Guide**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky** **notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary in their **vocabulary** **logs**, update the **Gist**: ***Farewell to Manzanar* anchor** **chart**, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Refer to the **Gist**: ***Farewell to Manzanar* anchor** **chart** **(example for teacher reference)** and **Work** **to** **Become** **Ethical** **People** **anchor** **chart** as needed.

- Students should not spend more than 15 minutes reading their assigned chapter, recording the gist, and updating the gist anchor chart. If students need additional support finishing the chapter on time, distribute **Synopsis**: ***Farewell to Manzanar,*** **Chapters** **14** – **17** to each student to review the key details from the chapter.

- When students have finished reading their assigned chapters, they can retrieve their **Connections** **and** **Distinctions**: ***Farewell to Manzanar* note** - **catchers**.

- Direct students to work with their expert groups to complete at least one connection or distinction in the tables for their assigned chapter on the Connections and Distinctions: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catcher. Remind them to use the **Authors’** **Methods** **anchor** **chart** as needed. Refer to the **Authors’** **Methods** **anchor** **chart** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as necessary.

- Monitor the progress of jigsaw home groups, referring to **Connections** **and** **Distinctions**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **note** - **catcher** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as needed.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- At the beginning of Work Time A, in preparation for the jigsaw activity, help students recall strategies for reading unfamiliar texts. Invite them to apply these while reading the independent research case studies:

- Chunk the text into manageable amounts, e.g., sentences or paragraphs.

- Circle unfamiliar words.

- Use context or a dictionary to define unfamiliar words.

- Annotate unfamiliar words with synonyms.

- Underline important people, places, and things.

- Read aloud.

- Read repeatedly.

- Silently paraphrase the chunks.

- Summarize what you read for someone else, perhaps first in your home language.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time A, for ELLs who require heavier support, provide a summary of each chapter in English prior to the jigsaw activity. This will orient ELLs to the content they will encounter, helping them to balance the cognitive and linguistic demands of navigating new texts. For increased support, provide summaries in students’ home languages.

Closing and Assessment

A. Jigsaw Share: *Farewell to Manzanar*, Chapters 14–17 – RI.8.3 (15 minutes)

- Direct students to return to their home groups (ABCD). Tell students that they are now going to consolidate their learning from the jigsaw and learn about the connections and distinctions made in chapters assigned to other expert groups.

- Students within home groups will take turns sharing aloud the significant connections and distinctions from their assigned chapters that they captured on their note-catchers.

- As students listen to the other students in their home group share out their identified connections and distinctions, they should take notes directly onto their own note-catchers.

- Circulate around the room to monitor progress. As productive, use strategic combinations of Conversation Cues to help students both be understood and understand others.

“Can you say more about that connection your expert group identified?” (Goal 1)

“So, do you mean \_\_\_\_?” (Goal 1)

“Who can repeat what your classmate said in your own words?” (Goal 2)

- Focus students on the Significant Ideas anchor chart, and ask jigsaw groups to share evidence to add to the chart. Some relevant connections and distinctions from the jigsaw chapters, which could serve as evidence to support significant ideas, are listed below.

- Chapter 15: The distinction between Papa leaving for war and Woody leaving for war is evidence of the significant idea that Jeanne’s youth impacts her understanding of events in the text.

- Chapter 16: The distinction between Jeanne’s ideas about “outside” America and the reality of America outside the camps is evidence of the significant idea that Jeanne’s ambivalence toward her Japanese identity was increased and complicated by her experience at Manzanar.

- Chapter 17: The connection between the Pearl Harbor and Hiroshima bombings is evidence of the significant idea that the idea of internment was created out of dangerous and unsupported assumptions.

- It is important that all students understand the significant ideas and events in these chapters. Circulate during student discussions to ensure students comprehend the significant events in the chapters. If not, distribute the **Synopsis: *Farewell to Manzanar***, **Chapters 14–17**, and review the document as a class, highlighting key events such as the following: Jeanne’s sister has a baby; Woody leaves for war; the Supreme Court declares the camps are illegal, but Jeanne’s family doesn’t leave right away because they don’t have a home; on August 6, 1944, the United States bombs Hiroshima and WWII ends; in October, Jeanne’s family leaves Manzanar.

- See the Connections and Distinctions: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catcher (example for teacher reference) for more detailed explanations of these distinctions and connections and their relationships to significant ideas in the text.

- Note that the significant idea addressed in chapter 17, internment was created out of dangerous and unsupported assumptions, was added to the Significant Ideas anchor chart during the optional Mini Language Dive of Unit 1, Lesson 9. If students did not participate in that Mini Language Dive, add this idea to the anchor chart now. Invite students to share evidence that supports this significant idea, including meaningful connections and distinctions that emerged in chapter 17 and in earlier chapters.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target. Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, collaboration, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- During the jigsaw share, invite students to share what their partners said to promote attentive listening, retelling, paraphrasing, and peer language modeling. Since students are accustomed to sharing out their own answer, explain why this is helpful, and provide them with frames and a model first: “My partner (or name of student) said \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.”

Homework

A. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread chapters 19–20 of *Farewell to Manzanar* in preparation for studying the chapters in the next lesson.
