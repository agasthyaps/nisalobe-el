Synopsis: *Farewell to Manzanar*,  
Chapters 14–17

**Name:** **Date:**

**Chapter 14 “In the Firebreak”**

- Jeanne realizes later that Papa was right that she shouldn’t get baptized.

- Papa has angry outbreaks unexpectedly, and Jeanne feels distant from him and sometimes from Mama, as well.

- Jeanne’s sister Eleanor voluntarily returns to camp from Reno, Nevada, when her husband is drafted for the war. She is pregnant, and the entire family is nervous about her having the baby in the camp hospital.

- Eleanor gives birth to a baby boy, and the family is very happy. Yet, Jeanne feels distant from her family in that moment as they celebrate.

**Chapter 15 “Departures”**

- It’s 1944, and many people, including some of Jeanne’s older siblings, have left camp to relocate or join the military. Most of those who are left at Manzanar are either very old or very young.

- Woody is drafted for the war. When he leaves, Jeanne doesn’t completely understand where he is going, but she is confident that he will be okay.

- Mama is both worried and proud as Woody leaves.

**Chapter 16 “Free to Go”**

- In December 1944, the Supreme Court rules that Japanese American internment camps are illegal in the third of three cases brought to it since the camps opened.

- The government announces that all camps will be closed within twelve months, and internees are granted the right to return to their former homes.

- Jeanne’s family is not happy about this news, as they do not have a home to return to. They are worried about how people will perceive them outside of the camp because of anti-Japanese propaganda throughout the war and groups that hold racist views toward Japanese Americans and try to prevent them from returning home.

- As others return to their former cities, Jeanne and her family hear news of violent attacks on some Japanese Americans as they resettle.

- Jeanne doesn’t really believe that anything violent will happen to her when she leaves camp, but she is afraid of people looking at her with hate. She recognizes that this is so frightening because some part of her now believes that she is deserving of hate.

- Some of Jeanne’s family begins to move to New Jersey, but Jeanne knows that Papa will not move there because it’s too far, and he is too tired and afraid of rejection to start over on the East Coast instead of the West Coast where the family has lived for many years.

**Chapter 17 “It’s All Starting Over”**

- The schools close at camp, and then the farm starts to shut down. Nothing new is planted, and machines and tools are sold.

- Jeanne and her family learn that the camp will close by December 1, 1944. Families are scheduled for resettlement. When scheduled, a family chooses a new city and the government pays for their bus ticket. If the family doesn’t choose a new city, they are sent back to where they lived before evacuation.

- Papa decides to let the government choose where his family will be resettled. He is in no hurry to leave Manzanar. He recognizes that others in the camp are worried about leaving as well, because they don’t know where to go or how to make money, so he decides he will organize a cooperative to help Japanese Americans find housing.

- On August 6, 1944, the United States bombs Hiroshima, Japan, and World War II ends.

- In October, Jeanne’s family leaves Manzanar.
