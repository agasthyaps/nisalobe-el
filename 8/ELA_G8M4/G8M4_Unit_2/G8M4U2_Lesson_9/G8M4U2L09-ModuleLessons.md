Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RL.8.7 – Work Time A: Students use note-catchers to track the choices made by the filmmakers of *Farewell to Manzanar* to convey the text.

- RL.8.7 – Closing and Assessment A: Students draw connections between the text and the film *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners by demonstrating perseverance as they complete the final segment of the *Farewell to Manzanar* film.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Provide additional time for rewatching the film for students who would like to do a more thorough analysis.

- As a way to reinforce work with RL.8.7, encourage reflection on the *Farewell to Manzanar* film as a whole, and better prepare students to analyze the model literary argument essay in the following lesson, invite students to discuss the questions below in small groups:

- Which major moments or scenes from the text were excluded from the film?

- Which major moments or scenes in the film did not take place in the text?

- How do these departures from the text impact your experience of watching the film?

- Which one or two significant ideas do you think were most effectively conveyed by the film? Why?

- Which one or two significant ideas do you think were less effectively conveyed by the film? Why?

- To help them answer the questions, students can refer to their copies of the text, gist notes, Compare Text to Film note-catchers, Connections and Distinctions note-catchers, and Close Read note-catchers, as well as the Significant Ideas anchor chart. Use Conversation Cues throughout discussion to expand students’ thinking and help students seek to understand the ideas of others.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- This is the final lesson in which students watch and analyze a segment of the *Farewell to Manzanar* film. As in previous lessons, students analyze moments in a film segment and determine the extent to which the moments stay faithful to or depart from corresponding chapters in the text. They also explain how the film moments convey significant ideas in the text.

Support All Students

- The film segment shown in this lesson contains content from chapters 8, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, and 22. Provide additional time as needed for students to review these chapters before watching the film. ▲

- Continue to use closed captioning to add English subtitles to the film, supporting listening comprehension for ELLs. ▲

- This segment of the film features sensitive content and situations that some students may find upsetting. For example, Papa, drunk and angry, accuses Mama of gossiping about him and lying about where she is. He pushes her to the ground and is only stopped from seriously hurting her when he is punched in the nose by his son. Even though this scene is not particularly graphic, its content is heavy and may be difficult for students to process. As needed, build time into the lesson for students to examine their feelings about this abuse aloud with a partner or privately in writing.

- This segment also presents news of Richie’s death at war and shows the Wakatsukis’ subsequent grief. Mama’s reaction, especially, may be upsetting for some students; the film depicts Mama weeping and screaming Richie’s name. Students may process this event in the film differently from one another; for example, students who have experienced profound loss may find these scenes more challenging to endure. Be mindful of students’ needs and responses. Note, too, that this death does not take place in the text. Consider warning students about this scene before playing the film segment so that students can prepare themselves as needed.

- If necessary, to support students’ note-taking, pause the film at the end of each moment as indicated in the Compare Text to Film note-catcher. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson guides students through viewing the final segment of the film adaptation of *Farewell to Manzanar*. Students will continue to use their Compare Text to Film: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catchers to track moments in the text and then draw connections between the film and significant ideas and events in the text. The Closing and Assessment of the lesson includes opportunities for students to probe into the filmmakers’ decisions, which helps them to understand significant ideas from the text more deeply.

- ELLs may find it challenging to record notes while they watch the film, as this requires careful attention to both visual and linguistic input (the film’s content) and output (writing on the note-catcher). As in other lessons in which students view the film, encourage students to take notes using simple words and phrases while watching and to then go back and refine what they have written immediately after viewing the film. Remind students that the sequence of events in the film may not follow the sequence of events in the text exactly and to be mindful of differences and potentially new content as they watch.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standard 8.I.B.6.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Compare Text to Film note-catchers to ensure that students are meaningfully and accurately capturing the ways in which the filmmakers convey significant ideas from the text.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will analyze a model literary argument essay using the Painted Essay® structure. The model essay uses ideas and evidence that have been captured on students’ Compare Text to Film note-catchers. In later lessons, students will work in pairs to plan and write practice essays that address a similar prompt.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Invite students to retrieve their **Compare** **Text** **to** **Film**: ***Farewell to Manzanar* note** - **catchers**. Draw their attention to the table for Film Segment 4. Ask students to note the six moments of focus described in the left-hand column of the table. Remind students that these moments are the six sections of the film segment that they will focus on as they watch.

- Refer students to the page numbers included in the right-hand column of the table. Remind students that this is where these moments can be found within the chapters they have already read. Ask students to retrieve their copies of the text ***Farewell to Manzanar***, and give them a few minutes to revisit these pages, reminding themselves of the content and the way that the authors have conveyed these moments in the text.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- For additional support in the opening of the lesson, work as a class to generate a list of notes about the important moments in the text that students will encounter while viewing the final segment of the film adaptation of *Farewell to Manzanar*. This will help students to process and retain this information as they view the film.

Work Time

A. Analyze *Farewell to Manzanar*, Part 4 – RL.8.7 (35 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze the extent to which the film *Farewell to Manzanar* stays faithful to or departs from the text, evaluating the filmmakers’ choices.”

- Tell students that they are now going to watch the fourth segment of the ***Farewell to Manzanar* film**. They will use their Compare Text to Film: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catchers, taking notes in the fourth table. Give students a moment to review their notes from the previous film segments to remind themselves of their earlier work.

- Remind students to keep in mind the habits of character on the **Work** **to** **Become** **Effective** **Learners** **anchor** **chart** and the **Work** **to** **Become** **Ethical** **People** **anchor** **chart** as they watch the film.

- Use the **device** to show the fourth segment of the film *Farewell to Manzanar* (01:15:21–01:46:00). As students watch, monitor their attention and progress on their note-catchers, providing encouragement and clarification as needed. If necessary to support student note-taking, pause the film at the end of each moment as indicated in the Compare Text to Film note-catcher. Refer to the **Compare** **Text** **to** **Film**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **note** - **catcher** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as needed.

- After students watch the fourth segment, allow students time to add notes to the right-hand column of the note-catcher. Remind students that these notes should describe the extent to which the moments analyzed in the film stay faithful to or depart from the text as well as how these moments develop significant ideas in the text. Students should use their copies of the *Farewell to Manzanar* text and the **Connections** **and** **Distinctions**: ***Farewell to Manzanar* note** - **catcher** to help them recall how moments were conveyed in the text. Students will have additional time to complete these notes for homework as well. Refer to the **Connections** **and** **Distinctions**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **note** - **catcher** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- Before students view the final segment of the film adaptation of *Farewell to Manzanar* in Work Time A, invite them to make a list of significant ideas from chapters 8, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, and 22 of the text. This will help to orient students to the film viewing task through review and help them to focus on key events, ideas, and individuals from the text.

For Heavier Support

- As in previous lessons, to help students navigate the content of the final film segment, cut the bullet points from each row in the first column of the Compare Text to Film: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catcher (example for teacher reference) into strips to make a tactile activity. Students can put the strips in order as they watch the film and then record the key ideas and events on their Compare Text to Film: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catchers.

Closing and Assessment

A. Make Connections to Text – RL.8.7 (5 minutes)

- Draw students’ attention to the second row of notes in the table for Film Segment 4. This is where students captured notes about the moments surrounding the loyalty oath meeting.

- Using a total participation technique, ask:

“What is the general mood at the loyalty oath meeting in the film and text?” (Responses will vary, but may include: there is a general mood of disagreement, tension, conflict, frustration.)

“What are the causes of tension and conflict at the loyalty oath meeting?” (Responses will vary, but may include: people disagree about their loyalties to the United States versus Japan.)

“What is one significant idea about the text that is supported by this scene in the text and film?” (Responses will vary. Help students recognize the effects of the internment experience on this tension and conflict.)

- Throughout the discussion, use strategic combinations of Conversation Cues to clarify, challenge, and expand students’ thinking.

“So, do you mean \_\_\_?” (Goal 1)

“Can you figure out why the filmmakers made that choice?” (Goal 3)

“Who can add on to what your classmate said?” (Goal 4)

“How does our discussion add to your understanding of significant ideas in the text and film?” (Goal 3)

- Add the following significant idea to the **Significant** **Ideas** **anchor** **chart**: The experiences of internment led to tension and conflict among the Japanese American internees. Students should also add notes to the right-hand column of the fourth table in their Compare Text to Film note-catchers, under the question “How do these moments help convey a significant idea in the text?” Refer to **Significant** **Ideas** **anchor** **chart** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- As time allows, invite students to note other significant ideas already written on the anchor chart that were conveyed through the filmmakers’ choices in this segment of the film (e.g., the filmmakers’ choices as Mama and Papa sang the Japanese national anthem conveyed the significant idea that Papa feels deeply conflicted loyalties, both to Japan and to America). Remind students that new details from the text will contribute to the development of previously identified significant ideas.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Complete Compare Text to Film Note-Catcher

- As necessary, students add notes to their Compare Text to Film: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catcher, drawing on their anchor text, Connections and Distinctions: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catchers, and other notes to determine how the film is faithful to or departs from the text. They also analyze how the moments in the text and film develop significant ideas.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent** **reading** **journal**.
