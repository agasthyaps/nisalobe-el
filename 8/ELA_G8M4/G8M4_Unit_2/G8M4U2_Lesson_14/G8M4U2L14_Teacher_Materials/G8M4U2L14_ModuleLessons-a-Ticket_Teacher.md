Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 14

W.8.1b

(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, read Proof Paragraph 2 from the Model Argument Essay: “How *Farewell to Manzanar* Conveys Jeanne’s Youth,” and complete the tasks and questions that follow.

<u>In another important moment from the text, Jeanne tries to make sense of the word *inu*.</u> **Jeanne and Mama hear two women call Papa an *inu*, which means “dog” in Japanese. At the time, Jeanne thinks the women who said this are just speaking badly about Papa “because he never socialized” (60). Years later, Jeanne would learn that “*inu* also meant collaborator or informer” (61)—in other words, a traitor.** This distinction between Jeanne’s early and later knowledge of this word emphasizes all that Jeanne did not know while she was a child living at Manzanar. <u>In this moment in the film, the filmmakers use dialogue to convey Jeanne’s naivete and confusion.</u> **In a departure from the text, Jeanne asks Mama what an *inu* is and Mama answers in the moment. She says that “here, it means worse \[than ‘dog’\]: someone who helps the enemy.” The camera shows Jeanne looking up, clearly trying to make sense of what she is told. She asks, “Who is the enemy?” Mama is not able to provide an exact answer, suggesting that the answer to this question is more complicated than young Jeanne can comprehend.** In this film scene, Jeanne’s questions signal to the viewer that Jeanne does not fully understand what makes an *inu* or why Papa is being accused of disloyalty. Mama’s response shows that she is not able to give Jeanne a simple answer to her naive question. By using this dialogue, the filmmakers remain faithful to the significant idea of the text that Jeanne’s youth keeps her from understanding these complicated concepts.
