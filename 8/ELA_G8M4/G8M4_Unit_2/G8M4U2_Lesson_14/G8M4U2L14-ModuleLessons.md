Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.8.1b – Opening A: Students answer questions as they analyze the role sentences play in Proof Paragraph 2 of the model argument essay.

- W.8.1b – Work Time A: Students use the Painted Essay® structure to more closely analyze a model Proof Paragraph to understand how it supports a point/reason with valid reasoning and relevant evidence.

- W.8.1b – Work Time B: Students orally rehearse their Proof Paragraph 2 sharing points, evidence, and the reasoning that connects back to the main claim.

- W.8.5 – Work Time B: Students orally rehearse their Proof Paragraph 2 with a partner and make a plan to enhance their writing as needed.

- W.8.1b – Work Time C: Students work independently to draft their Proof Paragraph, choosing relevant evidence to support their claims and using logical reasoning to explain their thinking.

- W.8.4 – Work Time C: Students write a Proof Paragraph organizing their writing in a manner appropriate to the task and purpose.

- Students focus on working to become effective learners, focusing on collaborating with peers while writing their practice essay and persevering to independently plan a Proof Paragraph.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release those students who are ready to read and analyze the model Proof Paragraph 2 independently and then move on to drafting Proof Paragraph 2 of their practice essay.

- Provide students with the opportunity to analyze the transitional words in the model essay. Consider partner work that supports students to identify words that signal sequence or transition in additional sources—reviewing informational texts from Unit 1. Synthesizing and listing transitional words on an anchor chart will enhance student understanding.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students worked in pairs to draft Proof Paragraph 1 of their practice essay. This lesson builds upon that work as students write the Proof Paragraph 2 of their essay independently.

Support All Students

- Students may need additional support while writing Proof Paragraph 2 independently. Group these students together, and have a discussion to help them find the best evidence to support their points/reasons and elaborate on that evidence, providing reasoning to show it supports the point. ▲

- Although students have had practice creating accurate citations, provide various examples of accurate citations for students to view online or scribed on an anchor chart as they work to include relevant evidence in their Proof Paragraph. ▲

- Students may have limited argument writing experience and be unfamiliar with strong Proof Paragraphs, in this and other genres. Providing examples and scaffolded support (sentence stems, annotated graphic organizers, models of Proof Paragraphs and opportunities to talk through their ideas) will help their writing. If needed, pull a small group to review this aspect of argument writing. ▲

- In Work Time A, students will be guided to use the visual concept of an evidence sandwich as a way of identifying and analyzing the parts of a Proof Paragraph. They will use this both to deconstruct the model essay and to help guide the planning and writing of their own practice essays. ▲

- Pull small instructional groups who need more scaffolding and support. Students might need extended verbal processing time to develop their reasoning statements. ▲

- Consistently referring to the model argument essay will act as a support for students who need reminders of what strong writing looks like. ▲

- Providing written and verbal directions and charting the steps they will take on an anchor chart could help students as they plan for their writing. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson follows a similar sequence to Lessons 12 and 13 with scaffolded tasks that guide students from analysis to independent writing. Students work in groups to analyze Proof Paragraph 2 of the model essay before planning Proof Paragraph 2 of the practice argument essay. Ample time for discussion and oral planning is built into the lesson, and the Closing and Assessment of the lesson invites students to give and receive feedback to further their learning.

- ELLs may find it challenging to complete their own written version of the practice essay, even with peer collaboration. Pair ELLs thoughtfully with supportive peers who can help them navigate the complexities of the task sequencing and the tasks themselves, and encourage students to refer back to the model essay, the text, and the Argument Writing checklist frequently while writing.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.C.11 and 8.I.C.12.

Assessment Guidance

- Use the Grade 8 Writing Process checklist to assess students’ writing abilities in Work Times B and C (see the Tools page at http://eled.org/tools).

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will write the counterclaim of their practice argument essay. In Lesson 16, students will work on their conclusions and then write an independent argument essay during their End of Unit 3 Assessment in Lessons 18–19.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 14, and ensure there is a copy at each student’s workspace.

- Strategically pair students for work in Opening A with at least one strong reader per pair.

- Review the Argument Writing checklist to become familiar with what will be required of students over the remainder of the unit.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time C: Prepare devices with word-processing capabilities for students to continue drafting.

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous modules to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.8.1b (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **2**, **Lesson** **14**.

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique to review their responses. Refer to **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **2**, **Lesson** **14** (**answers** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Analyze the Model: Proof Paragraph 2 – W.8.1b (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify the point, evidence, and reasoning in Proof Paragraph 2 of a model argument essay.”

- Remind students that one of the most important aspects of a Proof Paragraph is including evidence that directly supports the point stated. The evidence sandwich includes three parts:

- The point (bread)

- The evidence introduced with context (the filling)

- The reasoning (more bread)

- Remind students that in these essays about how faithful the film is to the text of *Farewell to Manzanar*, there are two evidence sandwiches in each Proof Paragraph. Display and ask students to retrieve their copies of the **Model** **Argument** **Essay**: “ **How** ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **Conveys** **Jeanne’s** **Youth**.” Read Proof Paragraph 2 aloud, prompting students to think about these three components of a Proof Paragraph as they follow along.

- Have students practice identifying the important aspects of a Proof Paragraph by finding and discussing the evidence sandwich in Proof Paragraph 2 of their Model Argument Essay: “How *Farewell to Manzanar* Conveys Jeanne’s Youth.”

- Turn and Talk:

“What do you notice about the organization of this paragraph, as compared to Proof Paragraph 1?” (They are organized very similarly. Both start with a description of a moment in the text before moving to discuss the film. Both Proof Paragraphs have two evidence sandwiches—one about the text and the next about the film.)

“What is the point of the Proof Paragraph 2?”

“What is the point/bread for the text evidence sandwich?” (The writer names the moment of Jeanne’s understanding of the word *inu*.)

“What is the evidence/filling from the text?” (“Jeanne and Mama hear two women call Papa an *inu*, which means dog in Japanese. At the time, Jeanne thinks the women who said this are just speaking badly about Papa ‘because he never socialized’ (60). Years later, Jeanne would learn that *‘inu* also meant collaborator or informer’ (61)—in other words, a traitor.”)

“What is the reasoning/bread for the text evidence?” (“This distinction between Jeanne’s early and later knowledge of this word emphasizes all that Jeanne did not know while she was a child living at Manzanar.”)

“What is the point/bread for the film evidence sandwich in Proof Paragraph 2?” (“In this moment in the film, the filmmakers use dialogue to convey Jeanne’s naivete and confusion.”)

“What is the evidence/filling from the text?” (“In a departure from the text, Jeanne asks Mama what an *inu* is, and Mama answers in the moment. She says that ‘here, it means worse \[than dog\]: someone who helps the enemy.’ The camera shows Jeanne looking up, clearly trying to make sense of what she is told. She asks, ‘Who is the enemy?’ Mama is not able to provide an exact answer, suggesting that the answer to this question is more complicated than young Jeanne can comprehend.”)

“What is the reasoning/bread for the film evidence sandwich?” (“In this scene, Jeanne’s questions signal to the viewer that Jeanne does not fully understand what makes an *inu* or why Papa is being accused of disloyalty. Mama’s response shows that she is not able to give Jeanne a simple answer to her naive question. By using dialogue in this scene, the filmmakers help the viewer to understand that Jeanne’s youth keeps her from comprehending these complicated ideas.”)

- Circulate as students complete the task, clarifying any misconceptions and answering questions.

- Display the **Characteristics** **of** **Argument** **Writing** **anchor** **chart**. Review aspects of Proof Paragraphs with students. Invite students to help record additional important aspects of Proof Paragraphs on the anchor chart.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Work Time

B. Orally Rehearse Proof Paragraph 2 – W.8.5 (10 minutes)

- Ask students to join their practice essay partner. Provide students an opportunity to orally review or add to the plan they created for Proof Paragraph 2 of their practice essay, planned in Lesson 11. Students should orally rehearse both evidence sandwiches they plan on using in their practice essay Proof Paragraph 2. Students can draw on their **Practice** **Argument** **Essay** **Writing** **Plan** **graphic** **organizer** to guide their planning and oral rehearsal.

- As applicable, support students by prompting pairs to ask each other the following six questions:

“What will you write as your text point/bread?” (Responses should identify the reasons students already planned together in Lesson 11.)

“What will you write as your text evidence/filling?” (Responses will vary.)

“What will you write as your text reasoning/bread?” (Responses will vary.)

“What will you write as your film point/bread?” (Responses should identify the reasons students already planned together in Lesson 11.)

“What will you write as your film evidence/filling?” (Responses will vary.)

“What will you write as your film reasoning/bread?” (Responses will vary.)

- Consult the **Practice** **Argument** **Essay** **Writing** **Plan** **graphic** **organizer** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) for possible student responses.

- Provide time for students to make revisions to their plans as needed. Students will use the updated plans to draft Proof Paragraph 2 independently.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

C. Practice Essay: Draft Proof Paragraph 2 – W.8.1b, W.8.4 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can write Proof Paragraph 2 for my practice essay.”

- Tell students they are now ready to draft Proof Paragraph 2 of their practice essays. Explain to students that they will draft Proof Paragraph 2 independently.

- Remind them to use the same series of questions used in the rehearsal to guide their writing.

“What is your point/bread?” (Responses will vary.)

“What is your evidence/filling?” (Responses will vary.)

“What is your reasoning/bread?” (Responses will vary.)

- Invite students to retrieve their **devices** and to gather any remaining materials from the list below, and refer to the Characteristics of Argument Writing anchor chart as they write:

- Model Argument Essay: “How *Farewell to Manzanar* Conveys Jeanne’s Youth”

- **Argument** **Writing** **checklist**

- **Painted** **Essay** ® **template**

- Practice Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer

- ***Farewell to Manzanar***

- **Connections** **and** **Distinctions**: ***Farewell to Manzanar* note** - **catcher**

- **Compare** **Text** **to** **Film**: ***Farewell to Manzanar* note** - **catcher**

- **Close** **Read**: ***Farewell to Manzanar***, **Chapter** **7** **note** - **catcher**

- **Significant** **Ideas** **anchor** **chart**

- Circulate to support students as they write and to identify common issues to use as whole group teaching points.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from Model Essay: “How *Farewell to Manzanar* Conveys Jeanne’s Youth” to explore how a writer introduces a counterclaim in an argument essay. Provide ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Invite students who need lighter support to predict some of the questions that the Language Dive may ask. This will improve students’ metacognition and challenge their awareness of the most interesting or meaningful elements of the sentence.

For Heavier Support

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from Model Argument Essay: “How *Farewell to Manzanar* Conveys Jeanne’s Youth” to explore how a writer introduces a counterclaim in an argument essay. Provide ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Encourage students who need heavier support to independently reflect on this sentence and its meaning before the next lesson. Students may also wish to add any unknown vocabulary to their vocabulary logs.

Closing and Assessment

A. Pair Share: Proof Paragraph 2 – W.8.1b (5 minutes)

- Organize students into their pairs from Work Time B.

- Display and invite students to retrieve their copies of the Argument Writing checklist. Point out the following criteria on the checklist:

- “W.8.1a: My reasons and evidence are organized logically, in a way that is easy to follow.”

- “W.8.1b: I support my claim with logical reasoning and relevant evidence.”

- Invite partners to swap Proof Paragraphs, with partner A reading the work partner B did on Proof Paragraph 2, and vice versa, paying attention to the criteria listed above.

- Ask students to share relevant feedback and to note any necessary revisions.

- As necessary, ask questions such as the following:

“What strengths can you identify in your partner’s work?”

“What next steps can you name for your partner?”

- Invite students to record “Y” for *Yes* and the date in the final column of their Argument Writing checklist if they feel the criteria marked on their checklists have been achieved in their writing in this lesson. Remind students to revise Proof Paragraph 2, as needed.

For Lighter Support

- As in Lesson 13, during the pair share portion of this lesson, encourage students to generate a list of three specific stars and three specific steps for improvement for their partners. Encourage celebration and build students’ confidence by inviting each student to share out one special strength they identified in their partner’s introduction.

For Heavier Support

- As in Lesson 13, during the pair share, to maximize feedback, have students work in small groups of three or four, rather than pairs, to provide an opportunity for students to receive feedback from more than one person. This will also allow students to see multiple examples of others’ writing, which will help to inform students’ own work, as well.

Homework

A. Revise Proof Paragraph 2

- Students revise Proof Paragraph 2 of their practice argument essay, based on feedback and criteria.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent** **reading** **journal**.
