Sample Proficient Response: Scorepoint 3, for Teacher Reference:

*Farewell* *to Manzanar* tells the story of the Wakatsukis, one of many Japanese American families forced to live in an internment camp during World War II. After the Pearl Harbor attack, the US government begins to view Japanese Americans with suspicion. The government unfairly believes that they might try to help Japan win the war against the United States. One significant idea in *Farewell to Manzanar* is that Ko Wakatsuki (Papa) feels deeply conflicted loyalties to both Japan and the United States. Descriptions of Papa help the reader understand how painful it is for Papa to feel loyalty to two warring countries. By looking at key moments of the text and the film, we can see that the film *Farewell to Manzanar* effectively conveys this significant idea of Papa’s painful conflicted loyalties.

In one important early moment from the text, Jeanne describes her father on the night of the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Papa has a beautiful Japanese flag which he brought with him thirty-five years earlier when he left Hiroshima. Hours after hearing of the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, Papa burns the flag (6). Keeping the flag all those years illustrates how much Papa’s homeland of Japan still means to him; burning it shows how much his sense of being American means to him. Clearly, Papa is feeling very conflicted about his choice to burn the flag. The filmmakers choose several techniques to capture this significant idea. The light is dim, which emphasizes the bright, devouring flames. Jeanne speaks in a voiceover, “I had never seen my mother and father so angry and so sad at the same time.” Papa holds his gaze at the flag in his hands, as if realizing what a big moment this is, then throws it into the flames. His face twists with emotion as dramatic music plays. Papa bows his head before the burning flag, almost as if he is praying. The filmmakers’ choices in this moment convey how deeply Papa loves Japan even as he destroys all the connections he has with it. Through its dramatic touches regarding lighting, voiceovers, music, and body language, the film remains faithful to the ideas in the text. Papa’s deeply conflicted loyalties are clear. He loves Japan, but he must separate himself from Japan to demonstrate support to the United States.

In another important moment from the text, Papa is interrogated at Fort Lincoln. He is being held as a prisoner. The interrogator asks Papa who he wants to win the war: Japan or the United States. Papa answers, “When your mother and your father are having a fight, do you want them to kill each other? Or do you just want them to stop fighting?” (58). This connection between the ideas of parents and countries emphasizes how much Papa loves both countries, and how hard it is for him to see them fighting in a war. In this moment in the film, the filmmakers use body language to convey these conflicted loyalties. Papa’s eyebrows are furrowed. He looks concerned and upset. He looks down at the ground rather than at the interrogator. However, when the man asks Papa whom he wants to win the war, Papa looks up. He holds strong eye contact. This is the moment when he delivers his important analogy comparing the United States and Japan to parents. In this scene, the change in the actor’s body language signals to the viewer that Papa is saying something important. He wants the interrogator to understand his conflicted feelings about Japan and the United States. By using powerful eye contact and body language, the filmmakers help the viewer to understand the significant idea of the pain Papa feels about his conflicted loyalties.

W.8.1c, L.8.6: Words, phrases, and clauses create cohesion and clarify relationships among claim(s), counterclaims, reasons, and evidence.

W.8.1a: Second point/reason and its evidence are organized logically.

W.8.1c, L.8.6: Words, phrases, and clauses create cohesion and clarify relationships among claim(s), counterclaims, reasons, and evidence.

R.8.1, RL.8.7, W.8.1b, W.8.9b: Demonstrates a clear understanding of the topic and texts by developing a valid claim with logical reasoning and well-chosen key events, supporting details, and quotations (where appropriate) from both the text and film.

RL.8.7: Accurately evaluates the effectiveness of the director’s choices and techniques in staying faithful to and/or departing from the text to convey the significant idea.

W.8.1a: A counterclaim is introduced and distinguished from the claims of the essay.

Some might argue that the film does not effectively convey Papa’s conflicted loyalties. Sometimes, the film contains new details that depart from the text. For example, in the text, when Papa burns the Japanese flag, he does not say a word aloud. The reader is given no explicit details about his body language. The flag is described simply as one he brought from Hiroshima many years before. The reader is able to infer how Papa is feeling based on what is already known about Papa in the text. In contrast, Papa says aloud in the film that the flag was actually a gift from an uncle. The film also adds other details, such as Papa bowing his head and looking near tears as the flag burns. It is true that the film departs from the text. However, even though this is a departure from the text, these extra details are effective because they add emotional intensity to the scene and illuminate the text’s significant idea of Papa’s conflicted loyalties. Through this film scene, the viewer can better understand Papa’s sadness at having to choose one country over another. The filmmakers’ choices might be somewhat different from the authors’, but they honor the same significant idea of painfully conflicted loyalties that the author intends.

All in all, the film effectively conveys the idea of Papa’s conflicted loyalties. Through faithful depictions of key moments from the text, the film shows that feeling connected to two countries at war is painful for Papa. Though some film details depart from the text, they are still in line with this significant idea. By making choices to emphasize the significant idea of Papa’s conflicted loyalties, the filmmakers have made sure the audience grasps this important, sad, and deeply personal aspect of internment at Manzanar.
