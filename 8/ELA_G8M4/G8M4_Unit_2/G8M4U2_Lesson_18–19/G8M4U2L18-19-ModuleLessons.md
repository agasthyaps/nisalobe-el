Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Work Time A: Students write a literary argument essay in which they evaluate the effectiveness of the film *Farewell to Manzanar* in conveying a significant idea from the text. Students use reasons, evidence, and reasoning to defend their stance as well as address a counterclaim. (RL.8.1, RL.8.7, RI.8.1, W.8.1, W.8.4, W.8.5, W.8.6, W.8.9b, W.8.10, L.8.2c, L.8.6)

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Some students may not require the level of scaffolding provided in this unit. Prompt students toward deeper levels of understanding and increased rigor by becoming familiar with Levels 3 and 4 of Webb’s Depth of Knowledge, a framework developed by Norman Webb to plan and provide complex instruction and assessments.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Throughout this unit, students have analyzed a model, written collaboratively, and planned their own independent argument essay. This lesson assesses those skills as students use their plans to compose their argument essays about the extent to which the film *Farewell to Manzanar* stays faithful to or departs from the text, evaluating the filmmakers’ choices in conveying a significant idea.

Support All Students

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment.

- Support ELLs in the end of unit assessment by reminding them of the related tasks that they have already successfully completed. Make sure that all assessment instructions are expressed very clearly. Ask students to paraphrase the instructions as a way to gauge understanding, and/or provide ELLs with simpler or additional input. ▲

- Before the end of unit assessment of Work Time A, review the criteria on Track Progress: Argument Writing to help clarify the objectives. This will help students understand expectations as well as offer a way for students to review the learning that has taken place throughout the unit to prepare them for the assessment. This review may be especially beneficial for ELLs, who may feel nervous about independently producing an essay during the assessment. ▲

- Before the end of unit assessment of Work Time A, allow students to orally process their note-catchers and planners with a partner to help formulate their thoughts before beginning an extended period of writing.

- Provide feedback on the assessment that emphasizes effort, improvement, and achieving a standard rather than on relative performance. Remind students that they are not competing against their peers; their measure of success should be how much they personally have improved in mastery of a standard.

- To support ELLs, these lessons include an essay writing assessment task on the End of Unit 2 Assessment that builds directly upon the work students have done in Lessons 12-17 of this unit. Students will write an argument essay that mirrors the structure and technique of the practice essay.

- ELLs may find it challenging to independently complete the End of Unit 2 Assessment without direct support from peers, as much of the work that has been carried out in preparation for this assessment has been collaborative. Point out that while students have worked together throughout the unit, they have also put in important independent work on their individual essay planners. Encourage students to do their best, and assure them that they will continue learning together after the assessment.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.C.10, 8.I.C.11, and 8.I.C.12.

Assessment Guidance

- End of Unit 2 Assessment: Write a Literary Argument Essay: *Farewell to Manzanar* (student and teacher reference versions) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- Decide in what format students will compose their essays. Provide lined paper or a computer with word-processing capabilities, depending on students’ needs and preferences.

- If students feel nervous about the end of unit assessment, remind them of all the work they have done to prepare (i.e., analyzing a model and writing a collaborative essay to the same prompt). Encourage them to recognize all the hard work and learning that has led to the end of unit assessment.

- Save a copy of the scored essays to use as a continued assessment of progress in writing. These pieces can be used to measure the progress of individual students throughout the year, as well as to identify common instructional needs in a class.

- When assessing and providing feedback to students on this assessment, use the Argument Writing Rubric (see Module 1 Teacher Guide: Appendix and/or Tools page, https://eled.org/tools), the RL.7 rubric, and sample outlines of possible responses provided in the teacher reference version of the assessment to help complete students’ Track Progress: Argument Writing. Make notes in the appropriate column for each criterion in a different color from student responses. There is also space provided to respond to student comments.

- Using information from this assessment, students are tracking progress toward anchor standard:

- W.1: By the end of Grade 12 I will be able to: Write arguments to support claims in an analysis of substantive topics or texts using valid reasoning and relevant and sufficient evidence.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will read an article about the lessons learned from this dark period of history.

- Read the assessment directions aloud as students follow along, reading silently. Ensure students understand the assessment directions; paraphrase some instructions, if needed. ▲

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence. Focus students on the **Work** **to** **Become** **Effective** **Learners** **anchor** **chart**; review perseverance and what this looks and sounds like. Remind students that, as they will be writing independently for the assessment, they may need to practice perseverance.

- Remind students that they planned this essay in the previous lessons.

- Invite students to begin the assessment.

- While students are taking the assessment, circulate to monitor and document their test-taking skills. Remind students that they may refer to any of the module materials as necessary during the assessment.

- Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target, using a checking for understanding technique. Scan student responses, and make note of students who might need support. Check in with them moving forward.

- Repeat, inviting students to self-assess how well they persevered in this lesson.

- Refer to the **End** **of** **Unit** **2** **Assessment**: **Write** **a** **Literary** **Argument** **Essay**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** (**for** **teacher** **reference**), **Annotated** **Practice** **Literary** **Argument** **Essay** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**), and the **Grade** **8** **Argument** **Writing** **Rubric** to assess.

For Lighter Support

- Before the assessment of Work Time A, underline key vocabulary in the assessment directions and prompt and read aloud together as a class to ensure that students understand the task. Invite students who need lighter support to restate or clarify information for students who need heavier support.

For Heavier Support

- Review the criteria on the Track Progress: Argument Writing with students prior to the assessment to help clarify the objectives. This will help students to understand what is being asked of them on the assessment and serve as a way of reviewing the learning that has taken place throughout the unit to prepare them for this.

Closing and Assessment

A. Track Progress (15 minutes)

- Give students specific, positive feedback on their completion of the End of Unit 2 Assessment: Write a Literary Argument Essay: *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- Distribute **Track** **Progress** **folders**, **Track** **Progress**: **Argument** **Writing**, and **sticky** **notes**.

- Guide students through completing the recording form.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target:

- W.8.1

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- As with assessments in earlier units, if students seem unsure of how to respond to the open-ended questions, provide examples of statements that answer the questions about previous improvements and goals for future improvement that are directly connected to the criteria within the Track Progress: Argument Writing handout to help students create clear self-reflection and concrete, attainable personal targets (e.g., “I have improved at organizing reasons and evidence logically, in a way that is easy to follow.” “In the future, I will work using additional linking words and phrases to show how my claim, counterclaims, points, and evidence are related”).

For Heavier Support

- Provide students with a sheet of paper on which they can use a selected color, number, or symbol to self-assess against each learning target in private. This provides useful data for future instruction and helps students monitor their own learning. If time allows, pair students with trusted, supportive peers to share how they have self-assessed.

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent** **reading** **journal**.
