**Chapter 21 “The Girl of My Dreams”**

- Jeanne feels split between her father’s world, which she wants out of, and Radine’s world, which she is very interested in.

- Jeanne and Radine are close friends until they start high school, but then things begin to change. At that point, Radine is asked to join sororities and promoted to a “song girl,” a special position with the marching band. Jeanne feels left behind, and their friendship ends.

- Papa almost dies from drinking too much whiskey and wine. He stops drinking forever. He decides to start farming strawberries, so the family moves from Cabrillo Homes to San Jose, California, when Jeanne is a senior in high school.

- Jeanne feels like she has a fresh start at her new school. She is elected as a carnival queen by her homeroom. She competes against fifteen other girls in her senior class.

- A classmate of Jeanne’s discovers that the teachers who count the votes for carnival queen try to cheat to make sure that Jeanne doesn’t win because they do not want a Japanese girl to be queen. Jeanne ends up winning after her classmate threatens to tell the school community about the cheating.

- Papa is angry that Jeanne wins because he thinks she is showing too much of her body. He wants Jeanne to enroll in classes at the Buddhist temple to learn Japanese dance and movement.

- Jeanne starts dance lessons, but she is kicked out of the class by the teacher after ten lessons for smiling too much.

- Papa continues to be angry at Jeanne, and things are distant between them. Mama is proud of Jeanne and takes her shopping for a dress to wear to her coronation as carnival queen.

- Jeanne feels uncomfortable throughout the coronation, and she can’t wait for it to be over.
