Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.8.4 – Opening A: On an entrance ticket, students determine the meanings of unfamiliar words as they are used in chapter 21 of *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- L.8.4 – Opening A: On an entrance ticket, students use strategies to determine the meanings of unfamiliar words as they are used in chapter 21 of *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- RI.8.3 – Work Time A: Students analyze how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in chapter 21 of *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- RI.8.3 – Closing and Assessment A: Students share their analysis, explaining key connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in their assigned chapters.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become to become effective learners by persevering as they read and analyze the complex anchor text.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Standard RI.3 in Grades 9–10 requires students to analyze how an author unfolds a series of ideas or events, including the order in which the points are made, how they are introduced and developed, and the connections that are drawn between them. Have students analyze how the Houstons unfold a series of ideas or events in chapter 21, examining the order of the events and ideas, how they are introduced and developed, and the connections between them. They can create a flowchart of their analysis and share it with their classmates.

- Encourage students to express what they have learned from their independent research reading using multimodalities. Students could create a collage, podcast, poem, or game to synthesize their learning.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students read chapters 19–20 of *Farewell to Manzanar*. Students analyzed the chapters for meaningful connections and distinctions as well as significant ideas. Students complete similar tasks in this lesson, reading chapter 21 and analyzing distinctions, connections, and significant ideas.

Support All Students

- At this point, students should be reading the text independently. However, if some or all students need more support, read several pages aloud and then release students to read independently, in pairs, or in small groups. ▲

- The subject matter in chapter 21 includes descriptions of appearance, gender, race, and sexuality. For example, Jeanne admires Caucasian ideals of beauty: “ideas about how a girl should look and dress and talk and act, and ideas of male beauty—which was why so many of the boys I liked were Caucasian” (154). She has a recurring dream in which there is “a young, beautifully blond and blue-eyed high school girl moving through a room full of others her own age, much admired by everyone” (154). Later, when Jeanne dresses in an “exotic” way and wins carnival queen, her father chastises her for “showing off \[her\] body” (158). He tries to impose Japanese ideas of beauty on her: “Modesty is important. A graceful body is important”; also important are not walking in an “assertive” way and not smiling (159). Some students may find objection with the procession of the carnival queen and her court. Offer support as students process these passages. Invite students to discuss their reactions aloud, practicing respect and empathy for one another’s feelings and for Jeanne, who lived in a different era. Use point of view work to help students establish distance from the ideas presented in the text; by more directly assigning the text’s ideas to the individuals in the text, students can better balance an understanding of Jeanne and others’ attitudes with their own rejection of those attitudes.

- During the independent research reading share, pair students who need heavier support. Invite them to select short passages from their independent research reading texts and read them aloud to their partners. This will reinforce speaking and intonation practice. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson continues to incorporate familiar practices and reading strategies during the in-class reading of the text and support students in recognizing connections and distinctions in the text (RI8.3) and connecting these to significant ideas. In the Closing and Assessment of the lesson, students will share about the independent research reading texts they have read, which provides ELLs with an opportunity to both think carefully about the texts they have read and to practice oral skills.

- ELLs may continue to find it challenging or anxiety-provoking to share about the independent reading research texts. Encourage students to prepare a list of key talking points about the texts they have read. Likewise, encourage students to prepare questions for peers in advance and practice responding to these questions. These preparations will help to build students’ confidence during the discussion and to foster meaningful exchange.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.5, 8.I.B.6, and 8.I.C.12.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Connections and Distinctions: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catcher to ensure students understand how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in *Farewell to Manzanar*.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will take the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment. The mid-unit assessment asks students to complete tasks that directly reflect the work students have done in class (i.e., use textual evidence to determine how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, events, and ideas).

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.8.4 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **2**, **Lesson** **6**. Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique to review their responses. Refer to **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **2**, **Lesson** **6** (**answers** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Using a total participation technique, invite students to share their definitions. Then, with students’ support, record the meanings of *diverged* (having gone different directions, separated, divided), *capitulate* (give up, surrender), *mediate* (settle, negotiate, solve), *assertive* (forward or aggressive in speech or action), *ultimatum* (uncompromising demand), and *obstinance* (reluctance, stubbornness) on the **academic** **word** **wall**, with translations in students’ home languages. Write synonyms or sketch a visual above the words to scaffold students’ understanding. Invite students to record these words in their **vocabulary** **logs**.

- Direct students’ attention to the **Work** **to** **Become** **Effective** **Learners** **anchor** **chart** and tell students that, as in the previous lesson, the habit of character of focus for this lesson is perseverance as students read and analyze the complex anchor text. As time allows, ask students to reflect on their perseverance in the previous lesson. Students can also set personal goals to ensure continued effective perseverance in this lesson.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- Build in time to discuss students’ responses to the entrance ticket. Encourage students to explain how they used context clues, affixes, and roots to determine the meaning of each word. Students may also benefit from verifying the meaning of vocabulary in a dictionary.

Work Time

A. Read and Analyze *Farewell to Manzanar*, Chapter 21 – RI.8.3 (25 minutes)

- Review the learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can determine the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary in chapter 21 of *Farewell to Manzanar*.”

“I can analyze how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, events, and ideas in chapter 21 of *Farewell to Manzanar* to develop my understanding of the text.”

- Repeated routine: Read chapter 21 in ***Farewell to Manzanar***. Use the **Text** **Guide**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students who are ready to read independently or in small groups should be released to do so. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky** **notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary in their vocabulary logs, update the **Gist**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **anchor** **chart**, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Refer to the **Gist**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **anchor** **chart** **(example** **for** **teacher** **reference)** and **Work** **to** **Become** **Ethical** **People** **anchor** **chart** as needed.

- If students do not finish reading the chapter within the allotted reading time, distribute **Synopsis**: ***Farewell to Manzanar,*** **Chapter** **21** to each student to review the key details from the chapter.

- Prompt students to Turn and Talk:

“What is the gist of chapter 21?” (Jeanne wins carnival queen at school; her teachers and Papa try to stop her from becoming queen, her teachers because she is too Asian, Papa because she is not Asian enough.)

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“Consider the title of the chapter. What does it suggest are the important events or ideas in the chapter? Who is the ‘girl of my dreams’? What does this metaphor convey?” (“Girl of My Dreams” suggests that the important events and ideas in chapter 21 are around Jeanne’s struggle to fit into and be accepted by Anglo-American culture, to become a girl of her dreams. The “girl of my dreams” is both the blond, blue-eyed girl in Jeanne’s dream (and popular, accepted girls like Lois and Radine), and it is also the girl that Jeanne hopes to become, her own person, accepting of self and accepted by others.)

- Ask students to keep these important events and ideas in mind as they identify significant connections and distinctions. Have students retrieve their **Connections** **and** **Distinctions**: ***Farewell to Manzanar* note** - **catchers**.

- Direct students to work independently (if they are ready) or in pairs to complete at least one connection or distinction in the tables for each chapter on the Connections and Distinctions: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catcher. Remind them to use the **Authors’** **Methods** **anchor** **chart** as needed. Refer to the **Authors’** **Methods** **anchor** **chart** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as necessary.

- Use a total participation technique to have students share the connections and distinctions they identified. Refer to the **Connections** **and** **Distinctions**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **note** - **catcher** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as needed.

- Display the **Significant** **Ideas** **anchor** **chart**. Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What significant ideas are conveyed in chapter 21? How are these ideas conveyed? What details, connections, or distinctions develop these ideas?” (Chapter 21: The idea conveyed is that Jeanne’s ambivalence toward her Japanese identity was increased and complicated by her experience at Manzanar. Distinction between Radine’s and Jeanne’s social success; distinction between Jeanne’s and Papa’s ideas about what it means to be feminine and what’s appropriate for Jeanne as a teenage girl; details about Jeanne’s recurring dream; details about Jeanne’s failed attempts at Odori classes; Jeanne makes progress toward understanding herself, but not yet there: She realizes that being the queen in this high school world is not who she is (“make believe carpet”) but is not yet sure about herself (“I did not yet know of any truer destination”).)

- Record student responses on the Significant Ideas anchor chart. See the Connections and Distinctions: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catcher (example for teacher reference) and the **Significant** **Ideas** **anchor** **chart** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) for more detailed explanations of these distinctions and connections and their relationships to significant ideas in the text.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Closing and Assessment

A. Share Independent Research Reading – RL.8.10, RI.8.10 (15 minutes)

- Remind students that the purpose of research reading is to build their content knowledge on the topic so that many of the ideas and domain-specific vocabulary words become familiar. This makes complex texts easier to read and understand. Remind students that they are expected to read independently for 20 minutes each day for homework, logging their reading and choosing and responding to a prompt in their **independent reading journals**.

- Explain that when a person is honest and follows through on tasks like homework, this demonstrates integrity. Consult the Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart to review *integrity* as necessary.

- Refer to the **Independent** **Reading** **Sample** **Plans** located on the Tools page (http://eled.org/tools) to guide students through a research reading share, or use another routine.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, perseverance, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- During the independent research reading share, strategically use combinations of Conversation Cues to challenge students who need lighter support to deepen their thinking and expand the conversation:

- “Can you say more about that?” (Goal 1)

- “Can you figure out why \[the author presented the information in that way\]?” (Goal 3)

- “How is what \_\_\_ said the same as/different from what \_\_\_ said?” (Goal 4)

For Heavier Support

- During the Independent Research Reading share, strategically use combinations of Conversation Cues to help students who need heavier support be understood and improve their metacognition:

- “So, do you mean \_\_\_?” (Goal 1)

- “What strategies have helped you succeed in your independent research reading?” (Goal 3)

Homework

A. Analyze Connections and Distinctions

- Students finish completing the Connections and Distinctions: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catcher for chapter 21 as needed.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their independent reading journal.
