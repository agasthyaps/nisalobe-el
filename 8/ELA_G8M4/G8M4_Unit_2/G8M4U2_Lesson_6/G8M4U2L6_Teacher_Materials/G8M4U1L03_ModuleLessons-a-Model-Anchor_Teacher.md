<li><p><strong>Jeanne tries Odori (traditional Japanese dance classes) again: “I lasted about ten lessons. The teacher herself sent me away. I smiled too much and couldn’t break the habit. Like a majorette before the ever-shifting sidewalk crowd, I smiled during performances, and in Japanese dancing that is equivalent to a concert violinist walking onstage in a bathing suit” (160).</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Jeanne makes progress toward understanding herself, but not yet there: She realizes that being the queen in this high school world is not who she is (“make believe carpet”) but is not yet sure about herself (“I did not yet know of any truer destination”).</strong></p></li>
