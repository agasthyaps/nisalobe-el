Mid-Unit 2 Assessment: Analyze Connections, Distinctions, and Point of View: *Farewell to Manzanar*, Chapter 22

(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Read the epigraph that begins part 3 (page 165).

<!-- -->

**Part C**

What sentence from pages 165–177 <u>best</u> conveys the answer in Part A? (RI.8.1, RI.8.3)

Responses will vary but may include the following:

“We couldn’t bear to mention it to anyone” (168).

“It stayed alive in our separate memories, but it was too painful to call out into the open” (168).

2.  This question has two parts. First, answer Part A. Then, answer Part B.

**Part A**

Which statement <u>best</u> represents the <u>connection</u> between the stones Jeanne sees upon her return to Manzanar and the people who lived there? (RI.8.3)

1.  The stones refer to the remaining ruins of Manzanar and are evidence of the ruin in the lives of the people who lived there.

2.  The stone mounds left by those who lived at Manzanar were cleared with the rest of the camp, erasing all memories of both.

3.  <u>The stones are reminders of those who were lost and those who created beauty for those who lived there.</u>

4.  The stone towers remain, marking the entrance to Manzanar and symbolizing the beginning of Jeanne’s healing.

**Part B**

1.  “Thirty years earlier, army bulldozers had scraped everything clean to start construction” (170).

<!-- -->

5.  “It seemed miraculous, as if some block of stone had fallen from the peaks above and landed upright . . .” (171).

6.  <u>“Near it a dozen graves were outlines in the sand . . .” (171).</u>

7.  “The rest of the place looks devastated by a bombing raid” (172).

8.  <u>“. . . lives were made more tolerable by gathering loose desert stones and forming with them something enduringly human” (172).</u>

9.  “They stuck up at intervals in every direction, strangely sharpening the loneliness and desolation . . .” (173).

<!-- -->

3.  This question has three parts. First, answer Part A. Then, answer Part B and Part C.

**Part A**

Which type of figurative language is used by the authors in connection to the wind throughout the excerpt? (RI.8.4, L.8.5a)

1.  allusion

2.  simile

3.  <u>personification</u>

4.  hyperbole

**Part B**

What connection to the wind is conveyed by the answer to Part A? (RI.8.3)

1.  The figurative language connects the wind to Jeanne’s Mama and what she taught Jeanne.

<!-- -->

5.  <u>The figurative language connects the wind to voices Jeanne hears as she explores the camp.</u>

6.  The figurative language connects the wind to Jeanne’s own children and their future.

7.  The figurative language connects the wind to memories Jeanne recalls as she explores camp.

**Part C**

What does this connection convey about Jeanne’s point of view toward Manzanar? (RI.8.4, RI.8.6, W.8.10, L.8.5a)

Responses will vary but may include: The personification makes a connection between the wind and the voices Jeanne hears. These are voices of those who died and lived there. Jeanne hears them in different ways in different places. At different times they are whispers, murmurs, humming, muttering, chattering, and singing. This suggests that Jeanne’s point of view toward Manzanar is both haunted and complicated, as some of the voices are linked to happy moments there for her. It also suggests that she views the camp as a living thing. The camp, which is now deserted, still contains parts of those who had to live there. Only she can hear these voices; her family who is visiting for the first time hears only the wind.

4.  This question has two parts. First, answer Part A. Then, answer Part B.

**Part A**

Reread this sentence from the chapter:

“Manzanar would always live in my nervous system, a needle with Mama’s voice” (177).

Which type of figurative language is used in this sentence? (RI.8.4, L.8.5a)

Metaphor

**Part B**

What does this figurative language convey about Jeanne’s point of view toward her experience at Manzanar? (RI.8.4, RI.8.6, W.8.10, L.8.5a)

Responses will vary but may include: The metaphor conveys that the pain of Manzanar has remained and sharpened over the years. It has become a permanent part of who Jeanne is and what she experiences. It keeps her on alert and reminds her of what can happen. It reminds her what she learned from her mother about enduring and thriving in the face of such difficulty.

5.  Explain the <u>connection</u> between the Japanese national anthem on page 81, the epigraph on page 165, and the excerpt. Be sure to also explain how that connection is made and why it is significant to the text. (RI.8.1, RI.8.3, W.8.10)

Responses will vary but may include: These three sections of the book are connected because they all use the imagery of stones. The anthem talks of a stone growing into a massive, moss-covered rock. The haiku that acts as the epigraph mentions stones washed by rivulets of tears. The excerpt connects the stones to the people who lived and died in Manzanar. This connection is significant because it illustrates the ideas of endurance and legacy, that those who were forced to live at Manzanar survived and are remembered. That though there were hardships, the people were not broken and were able to transcend the suffering they experienced.

6.  Explain one <u>distinction</u> made in the excerpt, how it is made, and why it is significant to the text. (RI.8.1, RI.8.3, W.8.10)

Responses will vary but may include: The excerpt makes a lot of connections, but it does make one distinction. The distinction between Jeanne’s experiences of camp as a child and her children’s experience of the camp is made through description and reflection. Jeanne’s children, at first excited to explore the ruins, soon turn irritated and bored by the heat and dust. They are ready to leave, and Jeanne acknowledges Manzanar is “no place for kids” (176). Yet, this is where Jeanne indeed had to spend part of her childhood. Though it was a difficult place with much suffering and injustice, it also was a place of some happy moments for Jeanne. This is significant because it again shows how Jeanne’s age impacted her view of the experience. She was young enough not to fully understand the gravity of her family’s incarceration, but it also shows that there, “in the zone between a child’s vision and an adult’s” (176), Jeanne’s life began. This distinction also highlights the reality of the effects of the camp experience, that it truly was no place for children, and that no one should have to live and endure that. Her visit there, and seeing her own children at the camp, helped her claim this part of her past and understand its lasting impact.
