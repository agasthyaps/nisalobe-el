Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Work Time A: Students complete the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment. Students read the beginning of chapter 22 in *Farewell to Manzanar* (pages 165–177) and answer selected response and short constructed response questions about how connections and distinctions are made among individuals, ideas, and events and the significance of those connections as well as how point of view is conveyed (RI.8.1, RI.8.3, RI.8.4, RI.8.6, RI.8.10, W.8.10, L.8.5a).

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners by reading and answering questions independently for the mid-unit assessment. Prompt students’ perseverance by reminding them that assessments are meant to inform instruction. Use assessment data to make choices about what should be retaught and how to adjust the pacing. Encourage students not to be afraid of making mistakes; an accurate assessment is crucial for tailoring lessons to students’ needs.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Some students may not need extensive review of the assessment directions. Release them to begin working on the assessment while clarification is provided to other students who need more support.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the first half of this unit, students continued reading the anchor text, *Farewell to Manzanar*, building their knowledge about the events prior to and during Jeanne’s family time at a Japanese American internment camp and analyzing the authors’ use of connotative and figurative language as well as how connections among and distinctions between individuals, events, and ideas are made in the text. This lesson continues those routines in an assessment, asking students to apply their learning to a new chapter of the anchor text.

Support All Students

- Chapter 22 makes reference to an older white woman hurling racial slurs at Jeanne and Kiyo as well as Jeanne’s fears about the FBI showing up at Jeanne’s door to take her away again. Students may need to draw on perseverance, empathy, and compassion as they read and discuss this content, being sensitive to their own and others’ reactions to the information presented.

- Some students may struggle to understand the assessment feedback they receive for the End of Unit 1 Assessment. Additionally, students who performed below their expectations on the End of Unit 1 Assessment may struggle with confidence after seeing feedback. Highlight strengths and assets to help students approach the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment with a positive mindset. ▲

- As with any assessment, students may feel nervous to read new passages independently and answer questions about them. Point out all the preparation they have had through activities, homework, and in-class reading time. Also, remind them there will be other opportunities throughout Module 4 to demonstrate what they have learned.

- Review the directions of the assessment carefully with students to ensure that they understand the tasks they are being asked to carry out. ▲

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment.

- For some students, this assessment may require more than the 35 minutes allotted. Provide time over multiple days if necessary. ▲

- An opportunity to track their progress after the assessment helps students reflect on and celebrate their growth.

- To support ELLs, this lesson includes tasks on the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment that are similar to the classroom tasks completed in Lessons 1-6. The assessment objectives, content, and format are also very similar to the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment. Students spend time reading and analyzing the section of the text that is used for the assessment and then work to answer relevant selected and constructed response questions. In the Closing and Assessment of the lesson, students will reflect on their learning and progress.

- ELLs may find it intimidating to complete the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment given the depth of analysis required. The assessment also places new demands on ELLs as they independently apply cognitive skills developed in Lessons 1-6 and new linguistic knowledge introduced in these lessons. Remind students of the strategies they have developed, encourage them to do their best to apply what they have learned, and assure them that the class will continue learning together after the assessment.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6 and 8.II.A.1.

Assessment Guidance

- All assessment materials for Mid-Unit 2 Assessment: Analyze Connections, Distinctions, and Point of View: *Farewell to Manzanar*, Chapter 22 are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback on this assessment, use the answer key and sample student responses (see Assessment Overview and Resources) to help complete students’ Track Progress recording form.

- Using information from this assessment, students are tracking progress toward anchor standards:

- R.1: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.

- R.4: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Interpret words and phrases as they are used in a text, including determining technical, connotative, and figurative meanings, and analyze how specific word choices shape meaning or tone.

- R.10: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Read and comprehend complex literary and informational texts independently and proficiently.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students finish reading and viewing *Farewell to Manzanar* and prepare to write collaborative and independent argument essays.

- Students’ Mid-Unit 2 Assessments will be returned in Lesson 17 with feedback.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **2**, **Lesson** **7**. Students will also need their **Module** **4** **End** **of** **Unit** **1** **Assessment** **with** **feedback**.

- Once all students are ready, invite them to share their stars and steps with a partner. Remind students that everyone is working toward individual goals and that learning is about continued growth and development.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Mid-Unit 2 Assessment: Analyze Connections, Distinctions, and Point of View: *Farewell to Manzanar*, Chapter 22 (35 minutes)

- Distribute **Mid** - **Unit** **2** **Assessment**: **Analyze** **Connections**, **Distinctions**, **and** **Point** **of** **View**: ***Farewell to Manzanar***, **Chapter** **22**.

- Tell students that for this assessment, they will read a new chapter in ***Farewell to Manzanar***. Then they will analyze how connections among and distinctions between individuals, events, and ideas are made in the text as well as how point of view is conveyed.

- Read the directions for the assessment aloud as students follow along, reading silently. Ensure students understand the directions; paraphrase some instructions, if needed. ▲ Answer students’ questions, but refrain from supplying answers to the assessment questions themselves.

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence. Instruct them to use the **Authors’** **Methods** **anchor** **chart** as needed while completing the assessment.

- Focus students on the **Work** **to** **Become** **Effective** **Learners** **anchor** **chart**, and review what perseverance looks and sounds like. Remind students that because they will be reading and answering questions independently for the assessment, they may need to practice perseverance.

- Invite students to begin the assessment. Circulate to monitor and document students’ test-taking skills.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- Before the assessment, underline key vocabulary in the assessment directions and prompt, and read aloud together as a class to ensure that students understand each task included in the assessment. Invite students who need lighter support to restate or clarify information for students who need heavier support. Review key terms (*connection, distinction, point of view*) aloud, and provide a glossary of terms that students can refer back to, as needed, to help them stay grounded while answering the questions on the assessment.

For Heavier Support

- Display a “map” of the assessment to reference while explaining directions to the mid-unit assessment. This will reduce ambiguity and give students a clearer picture of what they can expect so that they can better allocate their time and attentional resources. Provide students with colored pencils or highlighters so that they can mark up the map as needed. An example is given below:

- Read the paragraph from page 168 of the text. Then, answer questions about connections.

- Answer questions about figurative language and how it conveys a connection and point of view.

- Answer questions about connotation and distinctions in the text.

Closing and Assessment

A. Track Progress (5 minutes)

- Give students specific, positive feedback on their completion of the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment.

- Distribute **Track** **Progress** **folders**, **Track** **Progress**: **Read**, **Understand**, **and** **Explain** **New** **Text**, and **sticky** **notes**.

- Tell students the sticky notes are for them to find evidence of the following criteria:

- RI.8.1

- RI.8.4, L.8.4

- RI.8.10

- Guide students through completing the form. Encourage students to orally paraphrase the meanings of the Track Progress criteria, self-assess, and discuss the evidence with a partner before they begin writing.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their habit of character focus for this lesson.

For Lighter Support

- As with assessments in earlier modules, if students seem unsure of how to respond to the open-ended questions, provide examples of statements that answer the questions about previous improvements and goals for future improvement that are directly connected to the criteria within the Track Progress: Read, Understand, and Explain New Text handout to help students create clear self-reflection and concrete, attainable personal targets such as the following:

- “I have improved at choosing the strongest evidence in a text.”

- “In the future, I will improve at using a range of strategies to determine the meanings of words and phrases as they are used in the text.”

For Heavier Support

- Provide students with a sheet of paper on which they can use a selected color, number, or symbol to self-assess against each learning target in private. This provides useful data for future instruction and helps students monitor their own learning.

Homework

A. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread the rest of chapter 22 and the afterword (pages 177–188) of *Farewell to Manzanar* in preparation for studying the text in the next lesson.
