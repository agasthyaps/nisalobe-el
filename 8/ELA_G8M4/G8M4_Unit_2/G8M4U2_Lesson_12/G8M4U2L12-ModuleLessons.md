Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.8.5 – Opening A: Students review their plans for writing a collaborative argument essay and share them with a partner to better develop and strengthen their writing through planning and the guidance and support of a peer.

- W.8.1a – Work Time A: Students use the Painted Essay® structure to more closely analyze a model introduction to note how it effectively introduces the topic and proposes a main claim.

- W.8.4 – Work Time A: Students analyze the organization and development of a model argument essay, reflecting on how the introduction paragraph relates to the author’s purpose.

- W.8.1a – Work Time B: Students draft an introduction that hooks the reader, includes necessary context, and provides a clear main claim.

- W.8.4 – Work Time B: Students work with a partner to produce clear and coherent introductions, including the context needed by the reader, to their practice essays.

- W.8.5 – Closing and Assessment A: Students provide feedback to strengthen the introduction of their practice essay.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners, focusing on collaborative work in their partnerships as they write the introduction to their practice essays.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release those students who are ready to read and analyze the model introduction independently and then move on to drafting the introduction to their practice essay with a partner.

- An optional Mini Language Dive, intended for use after students analyze the introduction of the model argument essay in Work Time A, is available in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Students may examine multiple examples of introductory paragraphs. Gather multiple argument writing introductory paragraphs for students to analyze, read, or review.

- Provide the opportunity for students to write an argument essay on a topic relevant to the school community for practice or publication.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students analyzed the overall structure of the model argument essay using the Painted Essay® template and planned their practice essay. They build on those foundations in this lesson by more closely examining the role an introduction plays in an argument essay.

Support All Students

- Students may need additional support while drafting the introduction paragraphs to their practice essay. Group those students for a discussion to guide them in determining a main claim and relevant context to support their argument and overall writing. ▲

- Drawing the connection between writing types can support students. For instance, students might need a reminder that the term *main claim* is similar to the term *focus statement* they used in previous writing pieces. ▲

- Students may struggle with organization of materials while they go through the next few lessons of analysis and essay drafting. Provide time and both oral and written processes that support organization of materials. ▲

- Consistently referring to the model argument essay will act as a support for students who need reminders of what strong writing looks like. ▲

- Providing written and oral directions and charting the steps they will take on an anchor chart could help students as they plan and write. ▲

- Use a larger version of the model, either projected or copied onto chart paper, and add annotations to it for each section of the essay that is reviewed to provide clarity of purpose. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson scaffolds tasks to help students move from analysis to writing. Students work in groups to analyze the introduction of the model essay before working together to plan and write the introduction of the practice essay. Ample time for discussion and oral planning is built into the lesson, providing students with the opportunity to give and receive feedback to further their learning.

- ELLs may find it challenging to complete their own written version of the practice essay, even with peer collaboration. Consider the variety of ways that students support one another to more deeply understand the genre of argument writing and successfully complete their work. Choral reading, peer planning, shared writing, shared evidence gathering, clarifying tasks, varying scribing responsibilities, editing support, etc. are all possible roles students can play for one another.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.C.10, 8.I.C.11, and 8.I.C.12.

Assessment Guidance

- Use the Grade 8 Writing Process checklist to assess students’ writing abilities in Work Times A and B (see the Tools page at http://eled.org/tools).

Down the Road

- In the next two lessons, students will write the Proof Paragraphs of their practice essay, drawing on the planning work, drafting, and the analysis of the model done in this and the previous lessons.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Ensure there is a copy of Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 12 at each student’s workspace.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.8.5 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **2**, **Lesson** **12**.

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, encourage them to share their self-assessment of their plans with a partner.

- Focus students on the **Work** **to** **Become** **Effective** **Learners** **anchor** **chart**, and invite them to read the habits of character on the chart to themselves. Tell students to continue to focus on collaboration as they begin drafting their practice essays today.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Analyze a Model: Introduction Paragraph – W.8.1a (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify the purpose of each component of an introduction paragraph in a model argument essay.”

- Display the **Model** **Argument** **Essay**: “ **How** ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **Conveys** **Jeanne’s** **Youth**,” and instruct students to retrieve their copies. Explain to students that they will look closely at this model again and focus on the introduction paragraph to consider how the content can guide the work they will do on their own essay about the way Papa’s conflicted loyalties are conveyed in the text and film.

- Invite a volunteer to reread the introduction paragraph of the Model Argument Essay: “How *Farewell to Manzanar* Conveys Jeanne’s Youth” aloud.

- Using the **Painted** **Essay** ® **template**, invite students to work in pairs to discuss how the author catches the reader’s attention, provides context or background information about the topic, and states the main claim of the essay.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“How does the author capture the reader’s attention?” (The author states the topic of the text and film.)

“How does the author provide context and background information?” (The author provides information about how the story is narrated from Jeanne’s perspective and tells the significant idea.)

“What is the main claim of the essay?” (The author claims that by looking at key moments of the text and the film, we can see that the film Farewell to Manzanar effectively conveys this significant idea of Jeanne’s youth impacting her understanding of events.)

- Invite students to retrieve the following materials:

- Painted Essay® template

- **Argument** **Writing** **checklist**

- **Practice** **Argument** **Essay** **Writing** **Plan** **graphic** **organizer**

- ***Farewell to Manzanar***

- **Connections** **and** **Distinctions**: ***Farewell to Manzanar* note** - **catcher**

- **Compare** **Text** **to** **Film**: ***Farewell to Manzanar* note** - **catcher**

- **Close** **Read**: ***Farewell to Manzanar,*** **Chapter** **7** **note** - **catcher**

- **Significant** **Ideas** **anchor** **chart**

- Focus students’ attention on the displayed Argument Writing checklist. Point out the following characteristics on the checklist:

- “W.8.1a: I state my claim clearly, and my writing stays focused.”

- “W.8.1a: I have an introduction that gives readers the context they need to understand the topic or text.”

- Ask:

“How will you apply these characteristics to the practice essay?” (Responses will vary, but may include: When I draft my introduction, I will introduce my idea, and give important background information about the war and the US government’s treatment of people of Japanese descent. I need to group information in a way that makes sense.)

- As students share out, capture their responses in the “Characteristics of This Argument Essay” column.

- Invite students to add detail to their Practice Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer.

- Tell students they are almost ready to draft the introductory paragraph of their practice essays. Explain that in this lesson, they are drafting their introduction, and they will draft their Proof Paragraphs in future lessons.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time A, after students have analysed the model introduction, host a think-aloud. Display the introduction of the model essay. Invite a student or group of students to lead this activity, annotating aloud, in real-time, the writer’s thinking process. Invite students to note this thinking and recall the questions asked aloud.

- After Work Time A, invite students to participate in a Mini Language Dive in small groups to explore how the focus statement in Model Argument Essay: “How *Farewell to Manzanar* Conveys Jeanne’s Youth” introduces a claim (W.8.1a). This Mini Language Dive also gives students the opportunity to explain the function of a gerund in a particular sentence (L.8.1a). In the practice portion of this Mini Language Dive, students will have the opportunity to apply their learning to draft a focus statement for the Partner Argument Essay.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time A, after students have analysed the model introduction, host a think-aloud. Display the introduction of the model essay, annotating aloud, in real-time, the writer’s thinking process. Invite students to note this thinking and recall the questions asked aloud. An example is provided below:

- “First, I am starting with a brief summary of the text I will write about. I include information about the text that connects directly to the significant idea I will discuss. Then, I introduce the significant idea and explain which methods the authors use to convey this idea. After this, I present my focus statement, which includes the main claim of my essay and directly addresses the prompt.”

Work Time

B. Practice Essay: Draft an Introduction – W.8.1a, W.8.4 (20 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can write the introduction of my practice essay, giving context on the issue and clearly stating my claim.”

- Remind students that in the previous lesson they developed the claim for their practice essay, and they will next write the context to draw the reader in and provide background information that the reader will need to understand the claim.

- Allow time for students to retrieve their copies of *Farewell to Manzanar*, their Compare Text to Film, Connections and Distinctions, and Close Read note-catchers, and their **devices**. Invite students to work in their pairs using the model essay, the **Characteristics** **of** **Argument** **Writing** **anchor** **chart**, and the Argument Writing checklist to write an introduction. Students will each be writing their own essays, but will work in pairs to support one another. Remind students to refer to the **domain** - **specific** **word** **wall**, **academic** **word** **wall**, and **online** **or** **print** **dictionaries** as needed, especially for the definitions they provide while giving context in the introduction.

- Provide students an opportunity to orally recount the main claim from their Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer and rehearse their sentence with their partner before drafting. This may allow them additional time to organize their thinking. Remind students to write in complete sentences and to leave a blank line between each line of their writing. ▲

- Circulate to support students as they write, addressing clarifying questions and needs. Refer to the **Practice** **Argument** **Essay** **Writing** **Plan** **graphic** **organizer** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) and **Annotated** **Practice** **Argument** **Essay** (**for** **teacher** **reference**) as needed.

Closing and Assessment

A. Peer Feedback: Practice Argument Essay Introduction – W.8.5 (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can give kind, helpful, and specific feedback to my partner and incorporate feedback in my essay plan.”

- Invite students to pair up with a new partner to share the introductions of their practice essays written in Work Time B and to provide feedback against relevant criteria on the Characteristics of Argument Writing anchor chart. Ask for a volunteer pair to model this exchange, using prompts such as the following:

“What context do you include to help the reader’s understanding of the topic?” (Responses will vary.)

“What is one strength of the introduction?” (Responses will vary.)

“What is one area for improvement?” (Responses will vary.)

- Invite students to record “Y” for *Yes* and the date in the final column of their Argument Writing checklist if they feel the criteria marked on their checklists have been achieved in their writing in this lesson. Invite students to apply feedback they received by making revisions to their introduction paragraphs.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target and the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Review and Revise Practice Essay Introduction

- Students revise their practice essay introduction based on feedback and criteria.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent** **reading** **journal**.
