5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

W.8.1a, L.8.1a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

By looking at key moments of the text and the film, we can see that **the film *Farewell to Manzanar* effectively conveys this significant idea of Jeanne’s youth impacting her understanding of events.** (from paragraph 1 of Model Argument Essay: “How *Farewell to Manzanar* Conveys Jeanne’s Youth”)

**Lesson 12 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive during Work Time A, after students have analyzed the introduction of the model essay.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target (**I can identify the purpose of each component of an introduction paragraph in a model argument essay**) and W.8.1a by introducing the claim of a model essay. It also helps to address L.8.1a, as it uses a gerund phrase to represent a significant idea from the text.

- Transfer: noun + **of** + gerund phrase to introduce the main claim of a literary argument essay in the practice partner essay and the independent essay in the End of Unit 2 Assessment.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **By looking at key moments of the text and the film, we can see that <u>the film *Farewell to Manzanar* effectively conveys this significant idea of Jeanne’s youth impacting her understanding of events</u>**.

- Ask:

“What is the purpose of this sentence?” (Responses may vary. Look for students to identify that this sentence is the focus statement of Model Argument Essay: “How Farewell to Manzanar Conveys Jeanne’s Youth” and that it introduces the main claim of the essay.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **the film *Farewell to Manzanar* effectively conveys this significant idea of Jeanne’s youth impacting her understanding of events**

- Ask:

“What role does this chunk play in the focus statement of the model essay?” (This is the main claim of the essay.)

“In your own words, what is the claim the writer makes?” (The film version of Farewell to Manzanar shows how Jeanne’s childhood perspective was affected by her experience at Manzanar in the same way as the significant idea in the book.)

“Can you figure out if Jeanne’s youth impacting her understanding of events is a gerund phrase functioning as a noun or a participle phrase functioning as an adjective? How do you know?” (It’s a gerund phrase functioning as a noun. We know this because it follows the preposition of.)

“Why do you think the writer included this gerund phrase in the main claim?” (to clearly specify which significant idea from the text the essay is focused on)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **By looking at key moments of the text and the film, we can see that <u>the film *Farewell to Manzanar* effectively conveys this significant idea of Jeanne’s youth impacting her understanding of events</u>**.

- Ask:

“What if we remove By looking at key moments of the text and film,?” (This information clarifies that the main claim is based on consideration of both the text and the film, which is important information for understanding the main claim and the argument that supports it. If we remove it, the main claim still makes sense, but it’s not as clear that the writer is talking about how a significant idea in the text is portrayed in the film.)

“What if we remove we can see that?” (The sentence becomes ungrammatical and difficult to understand because this is the subject and verb of the sentence, which provide information necessary for understanding the main claim.)

- Ask:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target:  
I can identify the purpose of each component of an introduction paragraph in a model argument essay?” (Responses will vary.)
