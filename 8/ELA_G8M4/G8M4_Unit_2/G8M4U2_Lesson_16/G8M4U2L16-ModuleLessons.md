Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- L.8.2c – Work Time A: Students complete an entrance ticket to practice and demonstrate their command of English spelling.

- W.8.1e – Work Time A: Students use the Painted Essay® structure to more closely analyze a model conclusion, annotating sentences and aligning them to the organizational structure of a conclusion paragraph.

- W.8.1e – Work Time B: Students work in pairs to draft their conclusion, restating their main claim and providing additional reflection on the topic.

- W.8.4 – Work Time B: Students work in pairs to produce clear and coherent writing as they develop the conclusion of their practice essay.

- W.8.5 – Closing and Assessment A: Students receive and provide feedback to strengthen all aspects of their practice essay draft.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners, showing perseverance as they independently write.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release those students who are ready to read and analyze the model conclusion independently and then move on to drafting the conclusion to their practice essay with a partner rather than during modeling.

- Provide examples of effective conclusions from other argument essays or informational essays. Invite students to read a variety of conclusions and debrief with partners and as a whole group, having a synthesis discussion of how to write a strong conclusion.

- Have students review the conclusions to the informational articles used in Unit 2 with the class. Invite students to annotate the elements of the strong conclusion, provide a title, illustrate the conclusion in poster form, and then hang these exemplar conclusions around the room.

- Invite students to form pairs. Using a set of argument or informational conclusion paragraphs, have students choose the paragraph which they find particularly strong. Invite students to share their notices with a partner. Have students switch partners and share a few times.

- An optional Mini Language Dive, intended for use after students analyze the conclusion of the model essay in Work Time A, is available in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the second half of this unit, students have been analyzing a model and using their analysis to draft the introduction, Proof Paragraphs, and the counterclaim paragraph of their practice assay. This lesson continues those routines to guide students in writing and planning their conclusion paragraphs.

Support All Students

- For Lessons 11–16, students work with the same partner on a practice argument essay. This requires a considerable amount of focused collaboration across many lessons. Make strategic grouping choices to ensure that all students, including ELLs, are supported in their pairs. Make sure that differences in language ability within partnerships are not so stark that one student entirely dominates the evidence-gathering and writing process. ▲

- While students will complete their own written version of the practice essay in Lessons 11–16, consider the variety of ways in which partnerships can support students in helping one another to more deeply understand the genre of argument writing and successfully complete their work. Choral reading, peer planning, shared writing, shared evidence gathering, clarifying tasks, varying scribing responsibilities, editing support, etc. are all possible roles partners can play for one another in these lessons. ▲

- Students may have limited argument writing experience and be unfamiliar with strong conclusion paragraphs. Providing examples and scaffolded support (sentence stems, transitional words, annotated graphic organizers, models of conclusion paragraphs and additional opportunities to talk through their ideas) will help their writing. ▲

- Students may need additional support while writing their conclusion paragraphs. Group these students for a discussion to guide them through creating their conclusion in a step-by-step manner. ▲

- Pull small instructional groups who need more scaffolding and support and extended verbal processing time to develop their reasoning statements. ▲

- Consistently referring to the model argument essay will act as a support for students who need reminders of what strong writing looks like. ▲

- Providing written and verbal directions and charting the steps they will take on an anchor chart could help students as they plan for their writing. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson includes more spelling practice and then follows a sequence of reviewing the model and planning and drafting a conclusion that closely mirrors the sequence of planning and drafting the introduction, proof, and counterclaim paragraphs of the practice essay in previous lessons. This will help students to focus on the tasks at hand. During the Closing and Assessment of the lesson, students will offer one another feedback. This offers an opportunity for supportive learning, as well as meaningful oral skills practice.

- ELLs may find it challenging to write a strong conclusion, depending on the strength of the rest of their essays. Prioritize discussion and peer feedback portions of the lesson to build a supportive environment for students as they take on this work. Remind students to be respectful of one another’s progress, and invite students to offer suggestions and feedback that is specific and actionable.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.C.10, 8.I.C.11, and 8.I.C.12.

Assessment Guidance

- Use the Grade 8 Writing Process checklist to assess students’ writing abilities in Work Times A and B (see the Tools page at http://eled.org/tools).

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.8.2c (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **2**, **Lesson** **16**.

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique to review their responses. Refer to **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **2**, **Lesson** **16** (**answers** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

Work Time

A. Analyze a Model: Strong Conclusions – W.8.1e (5 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify the purpose of each part of the conclusion paragraph of a model argument essay.”

- Invite students to refer to their **Painted** **Essay** ® **template** to remember the parts of a conclusion paragraph:

- Restated Main Claim

- Reflection

- Direct students to retrieve their **Model** **Argument** **Essay**: “ **How** ***Farewell to Manzanar* Conveys** **Jeanne’s** **Youth** ” and reread the conclusion paragraph, circling the restated claim and underlining any further reflection.

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What role does the ‘further reflection’ play in a conclusion?” (The “what” of the conclusion provides thoughts on the importance of the main claim. The “so what” of the conclusion might leave the reader with a compelling last question, idea, or call to action on the topic.)

“What ideas do you have for the ‘further reflection’ in the conclusion you will write for your practice essay?” (Responses will vary.)

- Invite students to help record the parts of a conclusion on the **Characteristics** **of** **Argument** **Writing** **anchor** **chart**. Refer to the **Characteristics** **of** **Argument** **Writing** **anchor** **chart** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) and **Model** **Argument** **Essay**: “ **How** ***Farewell to Manzanar* Conveys** **Jeanne’s** **Youth** ” (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as necessary.

For Lighter Support

- After Work Time A, invite students to participate in a Mini Language Dive in small groups to explore how a concluding statement in Model Argument Essay: “How *Farewell to Manzanar* Conveys Jeanne’s Youth” follows from the main claim (W.8.1e). In the practice portion of this Mini Language Dive, students will have the opportunity to apply their learning to draft a concluding statement for the Partner Argument Essay.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time A, after students have analyzed the conclusion from the Model Argument Essay: “How *Farewell to Manzanar* Conveys Jeanne’s Youth,” display two additional alternate versions of this conclusion: one that’s been further improved with increased transition words, new punctuation, nuanced vocabulary, and coordinating conjunctions, and one with significant issues and errors with content as well as transition words, the use of commas and other punctuation, and spelling. Invite students to discuss the characteristics of each conclusion and to identify strengths and weaknesses of each one. To extend this further, have students revise the weak conclusion.

Work Time

B. Practice Essay: Rehearse and Write a Conclusion – W.8.1e, W.8.4 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can write the conclusion of my practice argument essay.”

- Discuss the following characteristic on the displayed **Argument** **Writing** **checklist**, adding to the Characteristics column as needed and answering any questions about the role of the conclusion in an argument essay. Refer to **Argument** **Writing** **checklist** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as needed.

- W.8.1e: “I have a conclusion that follows from and supports my argument.”

- Prompt students to gather their **Practice** **Argument** **Essay** **Writing** **Plan** **graphic** **organizer**.

- Invite students to review their graphic organizer to remind them of their claim, reasons, and evidence. Remind students that it is often helpful to orally rehearse the words they will use before they write.

- Guide students through the following series of Turn and Talks, giving them time to orally process each question below with their partner, as they refine plans for their conclusion:

“What: How will you restate the main claim?” (Responses will vary.)

“So What: How will you reflect on why this claim is significant?”

“Why is it important for people to think about how the filmmakers’ choices effectively convey a significant idea from the text?” (Responses will vary.)

“How is this significant idea connected to big ideas surrounding internment?” (Responses will vary.)

“What is the takeaway message you want your reader to have?” (Responses will vary.)

- Invite students to retrieve their **devices**, gather any remaining materials from the list below, and refer to the Characteristics of Argument Writing anchor chart as they write:

- Model Argument Essay: “How *Farewell to Manzanar* Conveys Jeanne’s Youth”

- **Argument** **Writing** **checklist**

- Painted Essay® template

- Practice Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer

- ***Farewell to Manzanar***

- **Connections** **and** **Distinctions**: ***Farewell to Manzanar* note** - **catcher**

- **Compare** **Text** **to** **Film**: ***Farewell to Manzanar* note** - **catcher**

- **Significant** **Ideas** **anchor** **chart**

- Tell students they are now ready to draft the conclusion of their practice essay. Remind students that as they draft the conclusion, they should restate the main claim (the “what” of their essay) and provide a reflection (the “so what” of their essay).

- Circulate to support students as they write and to identify common issues to use as whole group teaching points.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- After Work Time B, invite students to code their practice essay according to the Painted Essay® format. This can serve as a way of reviewing the content and structure in preparation for the sharing ahead in the Closing and Assessment of the lesson, as well as for the writing that will take place during the End of Unit 2 Assessment.
