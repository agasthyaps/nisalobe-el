5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

W.8.1e

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

By making choices to emphasize the significant idea of Jeanne’s naivete and its impact on her understanding of what is happening around her, **the filmmakers have made sure the audience grasps the complicated and often bewildering experience of internment that is conveyed in the text**. (from paragraph 5 of Model Argument Essay: “How *Farewell to Manzanar* Conveys Jeanne’s Youth”)

**Lesson 16 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive during Work Time A, after students have analyzed the conclusion of the model essay.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target (**I can identify the purpose of each part of the conclusion paragraph of a model argument essay**) and W.8.1e by providing a concluding statement that follows from and supports the main claim of an essay. Supporting standard: L.8.4c.

- Transfer: noun phrase + relative clause to make a concluding statement in the practice partner literary argument essay and the independent literary argument essay in the End of Unit 2 Assessment.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **By making choices to emphasize the significant idea of Jeanne’s naivete and its impact on her understanding of what is happening around her, <u>the filmmakers have made sure the audience grasps the complicated and often bewildering experience of internment that is conveyed in the text</u>**.

- Ask:

“What is this sentence about?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all replies.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **the filmmakers have made sure the audience grasps the complicated and often bewildering experience of internment that is conveyed in the text**.

- Ask:

“Can you figure out what bewildering means? How do you know?” (Bewildering means confusing. We can guess what this word means by considering the information that comes before it in the model essay and by considering what we know about the Japanese American internment experience.)

- Invite students to verify the meaning of **bewildering** in a dictionary.

“In your own words, what does this chunk tell us the filmmakers have done?” (They have helped the film viewers to understand the effects of internment in the same way they are presented in the text.)

“How does this chunk connect to the focus statement of the model essay?” (It explains the main claim that the filmmakers effectively convey a significant idea from the text in the film.)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **By making choices to emphasize the significant idea of Jeanne’s naivete and its impact on her understanding of what is happening around her, <u>the filmmakers have made sure the audience grasps the complicated and often bewildering experience of internment that is conveyed in the text</u>**.

- Ask:

“What if we remove By making choices to emphasize the significant idea of Jeanne’s naivete and its impact on her understanding of what is happening around her,?”  
(This information tells us <u>how</u> the filmmakers effectively convey a significant idea from the text in the film. Removing it is possible, but without it, we lose a strong concluding statement about the way in which the filmmakers portray ideas, which is an important part of the overall analysis and argument.)

“Why do you think the writer chose to end the essay with this sentence?” (Responses will vary, but look for them to recognize that this sentence reviews the information presented throughout the essay and restates the main claim to leave the reader with a clear sense of the argument being made.)

- Ask:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target:  
I can identify the purpose of each part of the conclusion paragraph of a model argument essay?” (Responses will vary.)
