Anchor Chart

W.8.1

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Introduction**

- Catches the reader’s attention and gives general context

- Main claim: addresses the prompt, focuses the piece by clearly stating the claim to be supported

**Proof Paragraph(s) for Point 1**

- States first point/reason that develops the main claim

- Provides facts and evidence from the text(s) that support Point 1

- Elaboration/reasoning: explains how this evidence supports the point/reason

- Restates the point/reason and/or reflects on how this reasoning has proven Point 1 and ties back to the main claim

**Proof Paragraph(s) for Point 2**

- Transitions well from the last paragraph

- States second point/reason that develops the main claim

- Provides facts and evidence from the text(s) that support Point 2

- Elaboration/reasoning: explains how this evidence supports the point/reason

- Restates the point/reason and/or reflects on how this reasoning has proven Point 2 and ties back to the main claim

**Counterclaim**

- Has three main parts:

- The counterclaim, the refutation, the elaboration

- Counterclaim: What counterclaim might others raise to challenge your claim?

- Transitions well from second paragraph, uses cuing language that an alternate claim is being introduced

- States alternate claim (different recommendation from writer’s own)

- Explains alternate claim fairly

- Refutation: How do you respond to this counterclaim?

- Acknowledges the validity of counterclaim before returning to own claim as the stronger

- OR contests the validity of counterclaim before returning to own claim as the stronger

- Reasoning: What reasoning supports your response?

- Reasoning: How does this reasoning support your main claim?

- Restatement of own claim

**Conclusion**

- What?: Restates the main claim

- So what?: Reflects on why this claim is significant
