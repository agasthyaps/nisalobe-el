Homework: Argument Essay Structure

(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Read the introductory paragraph from the Model Argument Essay: “How *Farewell to Manzanar* Conveys Jeanne’s Youth,” and then answer the questions below:

**<u>*Farewell to Manzanar* tells the story of the Wakatsukis, one of many Japanese American families forced to live in an internment camp during World War II. Their story is told through the eyes of Jeanne Wakatsuki, the youngest of the family. Jeanne is sensitive and observant, but because she is so young, she sometimes has a naive, or simple and incomplete, understanding of what is happening around her</u>.** One significant idea in *Farewell to Manzanar* is that Jeanne’s youth impacts her understanding of events in the text. Descriptions of Jeanne help the reader understand how Jeanne’s youthful naivete keeps her from understanding what was happening around her at Manzanar.
