Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.8.1 – Opening A: Students recall the meanings of terms associated with argument writing, such as *main* *claim*, *evidence*, and *reasoning*.

- W.8.1 – Work Time B: Students use the Painted Essay® structure to analyze a model argument essay, looking closely at how the writer created an argument to support a claim with clear reasons and relevant evidence.

- W.8.4 – Work Time C: Students analyze the organization and development of a model argument essay, reflecting on how each paragraph relates to the author’s purpose.

- W.8.1 – Work Time C: Students analyze the model argument essay and make connections to the criteria for effective argument essays.

- W.8.1 – Closing and Assessment A: As they examine the Characteristics of Argument Writing anchor chart, students identify aspects of the model essay that align to argument writing. They note where the writer created an argument to support a claim with clear reasons and relevant evidence.

- In this lesson, students analyze a model essay using the Painted Essay® structure to generate criteria for their own essays (W.8.1, W.8.4).

- The Painted Essay® (Diana Leddy, Vermont Writing Collaborative) guides students to code each section of their essay a different color to understand the function of each part, the content of each part, and how the different parts connect.

- The Argument Writing checklist used in Work Time C is a consistent resource in all grades; consider the amount of detail needed in modeling this for students.

- It may be helpful to remind students, during the lesson itself, that in their previous argument essay, they used reasons to support a claim. Here, because the prompt is different, they are using points (places in the text). The function is the same—to develop the claim.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners, persevering as they read and analyze the model argument essay with partners.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Students may start to outline their essay on Papa’s conflicted loyalties in preparation for the coming lessons.

- Students may examine more samples of argument essays. Providing multiple sample essays for students to color-code and analyze will support their understanding of genre and the subtleties of writing a counterclaim and using reasoning effectively.

- Students can generate additional points that support the argument in Model Argument Essay: “How *Farewell to Manzanar* Conveys Jeanne’s Youth” and provide new evidence and reasoning.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Students have worked with the Painted Essay® structure in previous modules. In this unit, they continue to use the same structure for argument writing as they did in Module 2.

- The model that students analyze is about how Jeanne’s youth impacts her understanding of events. Examining this essay prepares students to write an argument essay similar in structure and type of thinking to the model. The student collaborative essay will be about Papa’s conflicted loyalties. This assignment builds on the examination of the text and film versions of *Farewell to Manzanar* that students did in Units 1 and 2.

Support All Students

- Note that there is a differentiated version of the Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 10 used in Opening A in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- For students who may be overwhelmed by so much print on a page, reduce anxiety and support sustained effort by offering a copy of the model essay with one paragraph per page.▲

- Students may require additional support when reading for gist. Pair students heterogeneously for this activity, or group and read aloud for students who may need additional reading support. ▲

- Incorporate a mix of processing opportunities after reading, including writing reflections and small group and whole class discussion. ▲

- Vocabulary in the model and checklist could challenge students, especially ELLs. Consider providing strategic partnerships to support reading comprehension and vocabulary understanding while dissecting the model. ▲

- Provide opportunities for students to talk about the model essay and process their understanding of it orally, particularly of the reasoning and counterclaim. ▲

- Students might benefit from reviewing the nuanced differences between an argument essay and informative essay. Creating or revisiting anchor charts that capture important differences between informative essays and argumentative essays will continue to support students through the planning and drafting process. ▲

- The model essay can be delivered electronically to students.

- To support ELLs, this lesson introduces a new model essay and invites students to use the Painted Essay® to analyze its structure. Work with the Painted Essay® will help students understand the content and structure of the model essay, which students will apply when writing their own literary argument essays. Students will work together to identify the characteristics of an argument essay using a checklist, as they have done with previous genres of writing. This consistent pattern of reading a model essay for gist, coding elements of the essay using the Painted Essay®, and using a checklist to analyze the characteristics of the essay sets students up for success in navigating the nuanced differences among different types of essays and allows them to focus on key differences by minimizing distractions that might come from acclimating to a new process.

- ELLs may find it challenging to identify the characteristics of an argument essay and of argumentation, in general. Draw students’ attention to how language is used within the model to present claims and provide reasoning. Encourage students to annotate their essays as they identify criteria from the Argument Writing checklist. If time allows, refer back to previous essays that students have written, and invite students to compare and contrast the similarities and differences among different types of essays.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.II.A.1 and 8.II.A.2.

Assessment Guidance

- During Work Time A, check students’ understanding of gist in the model essay. Use any misconceptions or common issues as teaching points in upcoming lessons when the model is deconstructed in a more detailed way.

- Throughout Work Time B, frequently review students’ work to ensure they are color-coding accurately. Use common issues as whole group teaching points.

Down the Road

- In Lessons 11–16, students continue to deconstruct the model and complete a practice argument essay. In each lesson, students look at a discrete aspect of the argument essay model and practice using it in their own writing. Students then plan and draft an argument essay during their end of unit assessment in Lessons 18–19.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.8.1 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete the displayed **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **2**, **Lesson** **10** or the optional **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **2**, **Lesson** **10** ▲.

- If time permits, students can check their answers with partners or in triads. Students should continue to add to their entrance tickets, integrating their classmates’ ideas as needed, to make sure their definitions for the argument terms are as comprehensive as possible. If there is disagreement within a group regarding the precise definitions of the terms, or if no one in a pair or triad can remember what a term means, open the discussion to the whole class and clarify meanings. Refer to **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **2**, **Lesson** **10** (**answers** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- During Opening A, invite students who need heavier support to use Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 10 ▲. This resource features matching to help students recall essential argument terms.

Work Time

A. Find the Gist of a Model Argument Essay (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can find the gist of a model essay.”

- Distribute and display the **Model** **Argument** **Essay**: “ **How** ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **Conveys** **Jeanne’s** **Youth**.” Explain that this model essay will help them understand how they can apply what they have learned about argument writing to a literary text.

- Read the essay aloud as students follow along, reading silently.

- Ask:

“What is this gist of this model essay?” (The film Farewell to Manzanar faithfully shows the significant idea in the text that Jeanne’s youth impacts her understanding of events surrounding internment.)

- Instruct students to reread the Model Argument Essay: “How *Farewell to Manzanar* Conveys Jeanne’s Youth” aloud with a partner, pausing after each paragraph to share the gist with one another and check for understanding.

- After students have finished reading, use a total participation technique to invite responses from the group.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What is the gist of paragraph 1?” (Farewell to Manzanar is told through Jeanne’s eyes, but her youth often prevents her from understanding the complexities of internment.)

“What is the gist of paragraph 2?” (The film stays faithful to the text by showing how Jeanne talks with another girl on the bus about how Manzanar will be like summer camp.)

“What is the gist of paragraph 3?” (The film and text show how Jeanne doesn’t understand *inu* or the complexities around the adults’ conflicted loyalties.)

“What is the gist of paragraph 4?” (Some people might say that the film is not faithful to the text because it changes moments like when Jeanne clung to her mother’s legs at Papa’s arrest, but it is in fact faithful to the main details and feelings of the text.)

“What is the gist of paragraph 5?” (The film faithfully shows how Jeanne’s youth impacts her understanding of internment.)

- Record responses on the displayed model, and instruct students to follow along, recording responses on their handouts.

- Remind students that when discussing other model essays in Modules 1, 2, and 3, they looked at the tone of the essay. Similarly, it is important to analyze the tone in this new model essay. Explain that while discussing the choices filmmakers make and how faithfully they convey the text, the writer is careful to avoid blanket statements and overreach. This makes the essay more accurate and readable and also establishes and maintains a formal style. It also is respectful, showing that people can legitimately disagree and still be polite. One effective strategy the writer uses for this is including words like *sometimes*, *effectively*, *fully*, *in* *fact*, *however*, *all* *in* *all*, and *cannot* *always*. Direct students back to the Model Essay: “How *Farewell to Manzanar* Conveys Jeanne’s Youth,” and have them underline any words that suggest a respectful tone. Use the **Model** **Argument** **Essay**: “ **How** ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **Conveys** **Jeanne’s** **Youth** ” (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as needed, and call on students to share out the terms they underline.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- For continued spiraling with supplemental work with L.8.1a and verbals, invite students to underline all infinitives, circle all gerunds, and star all adjective participles throughout the model essay. If time allows, display a list of possible functions (i.e., noun phrase/activity, adjective phrase, adverb phrase, to indicate intention, to add a definition, to add a description), and invite students to call out examples for each category. This task will reinforce work that students have done with verbals throughout all modules and equip them to effectively use verbals in their own writing as they complete the Partner Argument Essay and the End of Unit 3 Assessment Argument Essay.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time A, provide a version of the Model Argument Essay: “How *Farewell to Manzanar* Conveys Jeanne’s Youth” that includes larger text and wider spacing cut into strips by paragraph. Invite students to work together in groups to reorder scrambled sentences and paste them on chart paper to create a collaborative, tactile experience. Once students have assembled the strips, they can determine gist and color-code them according to the Painted Essay®.

Work Time

B. Analyze a Model Argument Essay – W.8.1 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify the parts of a model argument essay and explain the purpose of each.”

- Display a **Painted** **Essay** ® **template**, and direct students to gather this resource from Module 1. Have students Turn and Talk to a predesignated partner whom they will consult for the remainder of the lesson:

“Describe how this template is organized, and explain the name and purpose of each part of the template.” (Responses will vary, but students should share the purpose of each section, naming the colors and their correspondence to each part of the essay.)

- Display the Model Argument Essay: “How *Farewell to Manzanar* Conveys Jeanne’s Youth” again. Distribute **colored** **pencils**, and guide students in using these and their Painted Essay® template with their partners to color-code their Model Argument Essay: “How *Farewell to Manzanar* Conveys Jeanne’s Youth.”

- Read the first paragraph aloud as students follow along, stopping at “ . . . happening around her at Manzanar.”

- Turn and Talk:

“What is the purpose of these sentences in the introduction paragraph? What color should these sentences be coded?” (These sentences are introducing the topic of the essay and providing context that the reader needs to know about the text and the film. They should be coded red.)

“Why is background information important to an argument essay?” (The background information is important for helping the reader understand the foundation of the argument.)

- Draw students’ attention to the word *naivete* in the introduction paragraph. As time allows, invite students to make a guess about the meaning of this word based on clues from context or affix knowledge (e.g., this word is related to the idea of Jeanne’s youth, so it probably refers to something childish; this word contains the word *naive*, which means something like inexperienced or young). Students can use dictionaries to confirm the precise meaning of this word.

- With students’ support, record the meaning of *naivete* (lack of experience, wisdom, or judgment) on the **academic** **word** **wall**, with translations in students’ home languages. Write synonyms or sketch a visual above the key term to scaffold students’ understanding. Invite students to record this word in their **vocabulary** **logs**.

- Focus students on the next sentence: “By looking at key moments of the text and the film, we can see that the film *Farewell to Manzanar* effectively conveys this significant idea of Jeanne’s youth impacting her understanding of events.”

- Turn and Talk:

“What is the purpose of this sentence? What color should it be coded?” (This sentence presents the argument, or main claim, that will be defended in this essay. It is the main idea that the reader should take away by the end of the essay. It should be coded green.)

“What is the writer’s claim or position in this argument essay? Use your own words.” (The film effectively conveyed the idea that Jeanne was young and did not fully understand the events of the text.)

- As needed, clarify the language students will use to name the parts of an argument essay. Remind students that in an argument essay, the focus statement is referred to as the *main* *claim*, and is color-coded green. Explain that, in an argument, we usually state just the “green” part of the focus in the introduction to the piece. This makes the main claim very clear and strong. The essay still makes points to support the main claim, but they are not stated in the introduction. Rather, the points will unfold as the argument develops.

- With students’ support, ensure the term *main* *claim* (focus statement) from Module 2 appears on the academic word wall and in their vocabulary logs.

- Direct students’ attention to the second paragraph of the Model Argument Essay: “How *Farewell to Manzanar* Conveys Jeanne’s Youth.” Read aloud Proof Paragraph 1.

- Ask:

“What is the job of this paragraph in the essay?” (to develop a point that explains how the film is effective in conveying a significant idea)

“What color should it be? Why?” (yellow, because it provides the first point to support the main claim)

“In this Proof Paragraph, what do you notice about where the evidence comes from?” (It comes first from the text, then from the film.)

- Read aloud Proof Paragraph 2.

- Ask:

“What is the job of this paragraph in the essay?” (to develop a point that explains how the film is effective in conveying a significant idea)

“What color should it be? Why?” (blue, because it provides the second point to support the main claim)

- Ensure students understand that the main claim states one main consideration. Two points, which are given and explained in each Proof Paragraph, support this main claim. For example, in the model, the two points the author uses to support the claim that the film effectively conveys a significant idea are the moment on the bus and Jeanne’s conversation with Mama about *inu* and the enemy. These are the basis of each Proof Paragraph.

- Direct students to the fourth paragraph of the essay. Read it aloud as students follow along.

- Remind students that this is a new kind of Proof Paragraph, one they saw in their Module 2 argument essay but did not see in their informative writing. Remind students that an argument is usually written about a complicated idea, one about which reasonable people can have different opinions. When constructing an argument, it is important to address possible opposition to their main claim. This is often called a *counterclaim*. There are several approaches to creating and using a counterclaim. In this essay, the author presents an alternate, valid claim, an opinion different from her own. She acknowledges it, but then uses it to support her own original claim. Explain that students will learn more about how to construct a counterclaim for a literary argument in later lessons.

- With students’ support, ensure the term *counterclaim* (a claim made to rebut a previous claim) from Module 2 appears on the academic word wall and in their vocabulary logs.

- Instruct students to color the counterclaim paragraph yellow because a counterclaim is just a special kind of Proof Paragraph. This counterclaim is offering more reasoning about why the film effectively conveys Jeanne’s youth affecting her understanding of internment, like the yellow Proof Paragraph.

- Draw students’ attention to the conclusion paragraph. Read it aloud as students follow along.

- Ask:

“What is the role of the conclusion in an argument essay?” (Responses will vary, but may include: to wrap up the piece by restating the claim and adding some additional thinking about why it is important.)

“How did you color-code the conclusion paragraph?” (The conclusion is green because it includes a restatement of and reflection on the claim.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Work Time

C. Argument Writing Checklist – W.8.1, W.8.4 (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can generate criteria for an effective argument essay.”

- Distribute and display the **Argument** **Writing** **checklist**. Prompt students to read the criteria on the checklist.

- Using a total participation technique, invite responses from the group:

“What do you notice about this checklist? What do you wonder?” (Responses will vary.)

- Give students a few minutes to reread the Model Argument Essay: “How *Farewell to Manzanar* Conveys Jeanne’s Youth.” Then, use a total participation technique to invite responses from the group:

“What characteristics on this checklist do you see done well in the model? What evidence from the model supports your thinking?” (Responses will vary, but may include: the author successfully gives two points to support the claim, evidence is used and explained, and there is a counterclaim.)

- If productive, cue students to listen carefully and seek to understand, and then to explain why a classmate came up with a particular response:

“Who can tell us what your classmate said in your own words?” (Responses will vary.)

“Who can explain why your classmate came up with that response?” (Responses will vary.)

- Prompt students to revisit their Model Argument Essay: “How *Farewell to Manzanar* Conveys Jeanne’s Youth” and jot down additional description for each aspect the Argument Writing checklist.

- Invite any additional responses from the group. As students share out the characteristics, jot down, say aloud, sketch, and display each characteristic to provide visual reinforcement. Invite students to identify characteristics of argument writing used in the model essay which can be applied to their own writing. Refer to the **Argument** **Writing** **checklist** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as needed.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Closing and Assessment

A. Debrief Argument Writing Anchor Chart – W.8.1 (5 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can generate criteria for an effective argument essay.”

- Invite students to think about the model and name some of the characteristics of argument writing they have noticed. Explain that they will continue to add to this chart in future lessons as they analyze each paragraph in the model. Refer to the **Characteristics** **of** **Argument** **Writing** **anchor** **chart** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) for support.

- Record student responses on the **Characteristics** **of** **Argument** **Writing** **anchor** **chart**, answer questions, and clarify any misconceptions.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Argument Essay Structure

- Students answer selected and constructed response questions about the model essay’s content and structure to complete **Homework**: **Argument** **Essay** **Structure**.
