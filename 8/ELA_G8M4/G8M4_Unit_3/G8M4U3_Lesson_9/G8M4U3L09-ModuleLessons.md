Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- SL.8.5 – Opening A: Students work in their triads to finalize their visual display of their researched organization, ensuring that it strengthens their evidence and adds interest to their presentation.

- SL.8.5 – Work Time A: Students practice their presentation of their researched organization, focusing on integrating their visual display.

- SL.8.6 – Work Time A: Students practice their presentation of their researched organization, focusing on adapting their speech to a formal classroom presentation.

- SL.8.6 – Closing and Assessment A: Students practice giving their presentation to another triad, giving feedback on how well they adapt their speech to a formal classroom presentation.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners through meaningful collaboration. Students collaborate to practice their presentations and give one another feedback.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Students who have experience in presentations can act as classroom experts, mentoring their peers on integrating visuals and adapting their speech.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students have focused on researching an organization which embodies one or more lesson from internment, interviewing someone from that organization, and creating a visual to represent their learning about the organization. In this lesson, students practice presenting their findings, focusing on creating and integrating their visual as well as adapting their speech to a formal classroom presentation.

Support All Students

- The subject matter in their peers’ presentations may include references to injustice, racism, or issues around poverty. Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this chapter that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually. To support students in processing this content, ask: “What habit of character did you use as you listened to your peers’ presentations?” Students may need to draw on perseverance, empathy, and compassion as they read and discuss this content, being sensitive to their own and others’ reactions to the information presented.

- Students who do not have strength in drawing should be encouraged to use digital images to create their visual display, so that they can produce a visual of which they can be proud. ▲

- In advance of the peer feedback in Closing and Assessment A, provide students with a list of five to ten common errors that have been noted in previous student speaking and examples of corrections to help guide their presentations. This list might include items from categories like grammar (e.g., verb tenses, subject-verb agreement, sentence structure), volume and pacing (e.g., speak loudly and pause to ensure understanding), or word choice (e.g., formal vs. informal). ▲

- Before students begin the peer feedback in Closing and Assessment A, ensure that they understand the purpose of the activity and how both giving and receiving feedback can benefit them. Knowing the authentic purpose of a task increases students’ engagement and effort. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson includes time for students to refine their presentation visual display and to plan and rehearse their presentations for the End of Unit 3 Assessment in the next lesson. Students will also give and receive feedback using the Tuning protocol and then make revisions based on what they have learned from the experience. This will help students to feel empowered as they get ready to deliver their presentations during the End of Unit 3 assessment in the next lesson.

- ELLs may find it challenging to rehearse in front of their classmates, as delivering presentations is often anxiety-provoking, especially for ELLs. Help students gain confidence by offering specific examples of effective oral skills, and encourage students to do the same for one another. Model providing suggestions for improvement that are kind, specific, and helpful.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.A.1, 8.I.A.2, 8.I.A.3, and 8.I.A.4.

Assessment Guidance

- Circulate to review students’ presentations and their feedback notes, ensuring that they are integrating their visual to clarify and strengthen their information and add interest as well as adapting their speech to a formal presentation.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will make their presentations to the class in the end of unit assessment, drawing on the skills practiced and the feedback given in this lesson.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Strategically assign student triads into groups of two triads each (groups of six students) for the peer feedback in Closing and Assessment A, ensuring that students are with peers with whom they can work collaboratively and constructively when giving feedback.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Opening A: Prepare devices with which students can create their visual displays (one per triad).

- Work Time B: Prepare video recording devices for students to use in the peer feedback activity (one per peer feedback group).

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous modules to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – SL.8.5 (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can integrate a visual display into my presentation to clarify information and add interest about my researched organization.”

- As students enter class, ask them to join with their triads and take out their **Performance** **Task**: **Activist** **Organization** **note** - **catcher** and their **visual** **displays**. Remind students that their visual displays should clarify information and add interest about the organization they researched and interviewed. Also, remind students that they will use this visual display in their presentations to the class as well as during the Activist Assembly for the performance task. The visuals may even become part of a display they post in their school or community. Therefore, students should work with their triad to make a visual of which they can be proud.

- Explain that students will have several minutes to finalize their visual display. However, if as part of their presentation practice in this lesson, they discover areas for improvement in their visual, they can work on it for homework. Distribute **materials** **and** / **or** **devices** **for** **developing** **a** **visual** **display**, and ask students to finalize their visuals.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons. Tell students that the habit of character focus of this lesson is collaboration. If time allows, invite students to revisit the **Work** **to** **Become** **Effective** **Learners** **anchor** **chart**.

Work Time

A. Practice Presentation – SL.8.5, SL.8.6 (25 minutes)

- Review the learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can integrate a visual display into my presentation to clarify information and add interest about my researched organization.”

“I can adapt my speech to make a presentation of my researched organization, focusing on speaking clearly and using academic language.”

- Ask students to remain in their triads, and remind them of their work with adapting their speech to make a formal interview phone call to an adult. Ask students to Think-Triad-Share:

“How did you adapt your speech when conducting a phone interview with an adult? Why was it important to adapt your speech?” (Responses will vary, but may include: we spoke slowly and clearly; we didn’t use any slang; we were polite, using please and thank you.)

“How might you adapt your speech when giving a formal classroom presentation?” (Responses will vary, but may include: we will speak slowly and clearly; we will not use any slang; we will use academic English.)

“What are some ideas you have for integrating or incorporating your visual display in your presentation so that it helps you clarify information and add interest?” (Responses will vary, but may include: we should mount the display on the wall, so that we have our hands free; we should make sure we face front when we point out aspects of our visual.)

“How does giving formal classroom presentations have value for you in future school and career endeavors?” (Responses will vary, but may include: we will have to give presentations in high school, college, and in most careers, so learning to give formal presentations now will help us have success in future school and career endeavors.)

- Ensure students understand that while this classroom may not feel like a formal space, practicing formal presentation skills will benefit them in the upcoming Activist Assembly when they speak with community members as well as in future school and career endeavors.

- Display and distribute the **Presentation** **checklist**. Remind students that they have used a presentation checklist for presentations before. Ask students to spend a minute reviewing this checklist and noting any differences between this and other checklists. Discuss as a class students’ noticings and their strategies for complying with these expectations. As necessary, model doing so:

“I see I am expected to accurately use grade-appropriate general academic and domain-specific words and phrases. As I practice my presentation now, I will consult the academic and domain-specific word walls as well as my vocabulary log. I will make sure I incorporate several vocabulary words and phrases into my presentation when it makes sense to do so.”

- Explain that students will now have several minutes to practice with their triad their presentation of their researched organization. Remind students that they should use the Presentation checklist to guide them. They should also draw on but not read word-for-word their notes from their Performance Task: Activist Organization note-catcher. They should also focus on integrating their visual display to clarify information in and add interest to their presentation. Finally, they should practice adapting their speech to a formal presentation. As necessary, display and use the **Performance** **Task**: **Model** **Activist** **Organization** **note** - **catcher** to model using notes to make a presentation.

- Release students to practice their presentations. Encourage students to first discuss in their triads which part of the presentation each triad member will give, how they will use their visual, and where each member will stand.

- Explain to students that their presentations should be no longer than 5 minutes. After they practice their presentation once or twice, they may want to use a **timer** to ensure they are on track.

- Circulate to ensure students are focusing on their integration of their visual and adapting their speech.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time A, help students who need lighter support to make their presentations more engaging by adding intrigue. Work with them to locate places where pauses, rhetorical questions, or changes in intonation could spark the audience’s interest during the presentations.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time A, to prepare students for their presentations, develop a mini lesson that invites students who need heavier support to practice general presentation strategies, such as making engaging eye contact with audience members and using body language, such as gestures and one’s own posture, to help convey messages. This mini lesson will help increase students’ confidence as well as challenge the idea that successful presentations are entirely contingent upon language abilities.

Closing and Assessment

A. Peer Feedback – SL.8.6 (10 minutes)

- Review the learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can integrate a visual display into my presentation to clarify information and add interest about my researched organization.”

“I can adapt my speech to make a presentation of my researched organization, focusing on speaking clearly and using academic language.”

- Explain to students that they will now present their presentation to another triad to get feedback on their integration of their visual and how well they adapt their speech.

- Move students into predetermined groups of two triads.

- Focus students on the **Work** **to** **Contribute** **to** **a** **Better** **World** **anchor** **chart**, specifically: “I use my strengths to help others grow.” Remind students that as they work to critique their classmates’ work, they will need to use their strengths.

- Inform students they should provide their partner triad with kind, specific, and helpful feedback about their integration of their visual and how well they adapt their speech.

- Direct students’ attention to the **Peer** **Critique** Protocol **anchor** **chart**, and remind them of what peer critique looks and sounds like.

- Distribute **sticky** **notes** and explain that listening students will record their feedback on these notes while their peers present. Also remind students to consult their Presentation checklists as they give feedback.

- Ask students to retrieve their Performance Task: Activist Organization note-catcher and visual display. Release students to begin presenting and giving peer feedback. As necessary, students can use **video** **recording** **devices** to record their peers’ presentations to assist in giving feedback.

- Circulate to support students as they work to give feedback to one another. As necessary, encourage students to use the sentence starters on the Peer Critique Protocol anchor chart to share their feedback.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets and on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Practice Presentation

- Students continue to practice their presentations for the end of unit assessment, focusing on the areas of feedback provided in this lesson.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent** **reading** **journal**.
