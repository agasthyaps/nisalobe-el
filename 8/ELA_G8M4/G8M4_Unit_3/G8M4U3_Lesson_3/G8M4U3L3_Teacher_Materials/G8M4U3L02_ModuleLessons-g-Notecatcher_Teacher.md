(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** In the first box of each table, write a brief summary of each section from the article “Psychological Effects of Camp.” Then, record evidence from *Farewell to Manzanar* and other texts read throughout the module that aligns to the evidence in the article “Psychological Effects of Camp.” Synthesize all the evidence to determine what lesson from internment the texts convey.

<td><strong>The central idea of section one of the article “Psychological Effects of Camp” is that there were negative psychological effects of internment. For example, after being forced from their homes and lives, Japanese Americans at first felt “shock, fear, and worry.” Then as they experienced the “dehumanizing conditions” of the camps, they felt “helplessness” and “tensions” among themselves. Issei men experienced extreme “stress” and “loneliness” in DOJ camps, separated from their families and falsely accused of treason. In non-DOJ camps, Issei men lost their status as heads of household and community. Nissei experienced strong negative effects as their college education and careers were disrupted by the incarceration. All these examples show how there were negative psychological effects of internment.</strong></td>

<p><strong>• Distinction between Papa before the camps and Papa in camp in chapter 8: Papa’s “dark, bitter, brooding presence” (59) is “unfamiliar” and a “demon” compared with the man who “lived in Ocean Park” (63).</strong></p></td>

<td><strong>The section “Post-War Impacts” develops the central idea that “the closing of the camps did not end the psychological impacts of the incarceration.” The Issei were often too old to return to work, so they became depressed; some even committed suicide. Most of the Nisei were ashamed and traumatized, so they didn’t speak of their camp experiences and tried to fit in to American culture. Many of the Sansei felt sadness and anger at their parents’ silence about their pain. Many also lost connection to their Japanese language and culture because their parents didn’t want to associate with anything Japanese. These details demonstrate that the psychological impacts of the incarceration affected all three generations of Japanese-Americans after the war.</strong></td>

<td><strong>The section “Resilience and Positive Effects” develops the central idea that there were some positive effects of the incarceration. Incarcerees demonstrated resilience and resourcefulness in the camps. They made art, improved living conditions, and learned new jobs. Some Nisei also relocated to the Midwest and East. The move was stressful but broadened their horizons. Also, the incarcerees supported one another and established strong, life-long connections. Additionally, many Nisei went on to live successful lives, and the Sansei view their parents and grandparents as role models. Finally, the incarceration made Japanese Americans more aware of social justice issues and “watchful of policies and prejudices that unjustly target other groups.” These details demonstrate that there were some positive effects of the incarceration.</strong></td>
