Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.8.1 – Opening A: In an opening activity, students share the evidence they gathered for homework from the article “Psychological Effects of Camp,” *Farewell to Manzanar*, and any other texts to support their analysis of the lessons from internment.

- RI.8.2 – Work Time A: Students read and analyze the development of central ideas over the course of the article “Psychological Effects of Camp.”

- RI.8.4 – Work Time A: Students determine the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary in the article “Psychological Effects of Camp.”

- L.8.4 – Work Time A: Students use strategies to determine the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary in the article “Psychological Effects of Camp.”

- RI.8.2 – Work Time B: Students participate in a Language Dive to determine and analyze a central idea in the text.

- SL.8.1 – Closing and Assessment A: Students engage in a collaborative discussion about how the article “Psychological Effects of Camp” conveys lessons from internment. During the discussion, students draw on their notes, follow agreed-upon rules, ask and answer relevant questions, and acknowledge new information.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners by collaborating with peers to read and analyze a complex text as well as in a collaborative discussion.

- In this lesson, students engage in a modified Jigsaw protocol. In small groups, they read one of the two remaining sections of the article “Psychological Effects of Camp.” Then instead of reporting to a home group, they report to the class.

- In the excerpts of “Psychological Effects of Camp” read in this lesson, the incarcerated people of Japanese descent demonstrate “resourcefulness and resilience” or perseverance, empathy, compassion, and using their strengths to help others and improve their environments as they improve their living conditions and support one another through the physical and psychological challenges of unlawful incarceration.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- If possible, help students access video testimonies of Japanese American Internment survivors, available on the Densho.org website (http://eled.org/0263). Students can view the testimonies and determine the central ideas as well as how they relate to the article “Psychological Effects of Camp.” They can create a table or visual to share this information with their classmates.

- The RI.2 standard for Grades 9 and 10 asks students to determine two or more central ideas of a text and analyze their development, including how they build on one another to provide a complex analysis. Ask students to determine two or more central ideas from the article “Psychological Effects of Camp” and analyze how they build on one another. Students can form pairs or small groups to discuss their analysis of the article.

- Release more responsibility more quickly to students as they comprehend the tasks or concepts:

- If students finish reading their section of the article before others do, they can move on to writing a summary of their section on the Lessons from Internment note-catcher. They can then find evidence from other texts that relates to the information in their section of the article.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students have focused on reading and analyzing central ideas in a close read of the first section of the article “Psychological Effects of Camp.” In this lesson, students will continue this work with more independence by finishing the article and analyzing it for central ideas as well as for how it conveys lessons from internment.

Support All Students

- At this point, students should be reading the text independently. However, if some or all students need more support, read several paragraphs aloud and then release students to read independently, in pairs, or in small groups.

- The subject matter in this article includes references to the imprisonment and harsh treatment of people of Japanese descent as well as the psychological effects of this treatment, including depression that led to suicide. Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually. To support students in processing this content, ask: “What habit of character did you use as you read and discussed this excerpt?” Students may need to draw on perseverance, empathy, compassion as they read and discuss this content, being sensitive to their own and others’ reactions to the information presented.

- Draw together in a group those students who are not ready to read the article in small groups to guide them to read, determine vocabulary, identify gist, and analyze central ideas. ▲

- During the jigsaw of Work Time A, students read one of the remaining sections of the article “Psychological Effects of Camp.” The third section, “Resilience and Positive Effects,” is slightly shorter than the second section, “Postwar Impacts.” Consider assigning the third section to ELLs and other readers who need additional support. Reading and interpreting a shorter section will help students preserve the cognitive energy needed for a thorough analysis of the central ideas. ▲

- Help students to track ideas exchanged during the collaborative discussion by recording notes on a whiteboard or overhead as students contribute to the exchange. This will help students to follow the conversation and provide a reference point from which students thoughtfully build as they participate in the discussion. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson builds on work in the previous lesson. Students continue to read an article about the effects of Japanese American internment and work to generate important lessons from internment based on their reading of this text and others throughout the module. After reading the article, students participate in a Language Dive to explore a central idea in the text. The Closing and Assessment of the lesson is a collaborative discussion that will help to prepare students for the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment collaborative discussion, in which students will synthesize their learning to discuss lessons from Japanese American internment.

- ELLs may find it challenging to read the article “Psychological Effects of Camp,” as this text is dense and the information presented in it is complex. Pair students thoughtfully for the reading portion of the lesson, and prioritize the Language Dive to help students access important ideas in the text. During the discussion in the Closing and Assessment of the lesson, use Conversation Cues and sentence frames to help students navigate the discussion. Approaching this task with support will also help ELLs to continue to develop their overall oral English language proficiency.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6, 8.I.B.8, 8.II.A.1, and 8.II.A.2.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Lessons from Internment note-catchers to ensure students understand how to determine central ideas and trace their development across the text in an objective summary.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will read and analyze central ideas in an article titled “Japanese Internment Camp Survivors Protest Ft. Sill Migrant Detention Center.” Students will also use the Lessons from Internment note-catcher to capture their ideas about the lessons learned from this article. They will draw on the notes in the Mid-Unit 3 collaborative discussion in Lesson 5.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Preview the Lessons from Internment note-catcher (example for teacher reference) to become familiar with what is required of students.

- Strategically group students into small groups for the Jigsaw Reading and analysis in Work Time A and for the collaborative discussion of Closing and Assessment A. Be mindful of students’ needs when selecting students to work together. For example, consider pairing students by similar content knowledge, home language, or reading level so that they can support one another without one student dominating over another. ▲

- For Closing and Assessment A, each student is encouraged to ask and answer at least one question and make one statement to acknowledge others’ ideas or justify or qualify their own ideas. If necessary, consider giving each student three objects that they have to place in a communal container each time they participate in the discussion. If using this support, gather the following materials:

- Objects (like spoons, buttons, or paper clips; three per student)

- Container to hold the objects (one per discussion group)

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time A: For students who will benefit from hearing the texts read aloud multiple times, use a text-to-speech tool such as http://eled.org/0103. Note that to use a web-based text-to-speech tool, an online doc containing the text will need to be created. ▲

- Work Times A and B: Convert the Lessons from Internment note-catcher into an online format such as http://eled.org/0158, and invite students to complete them digitally.

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous modules to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.8.1 (5 minutes)

- Ask students to retrieve their **Lessons** **from** **Internment** **note** - **catchers** and Turn and Talk to share the evidence they recorded for homework from the article “ **Psychological** **Effects** **of** **Camp**,” ***Farewell to Manzanar***, and any other texts. Use **equity** **sticks** to ask students to share their responses. Consult the **Lessons** **from** **Internment** **note** - **catcher** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**). Students should add evidence to their note-catchers based on this sharing.

- Remind students that they will use this note-catcher throughout the first half of Unit 3 to gather evidence for a collaborative discussion in their mid-unit assessment on lessons from internment.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read and Analyze “Psychological Effects of Camp” – RI.8.2 (20 minutes)

- Review the learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can determine the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary in the article ‘Psychological Effects of Camp.’”

“I can determine a central idea and analyze its development over the course of the article ‘Psychological Effects of Camp.’”

- Ask students to retrieve their copies of the article Text: “Psychological Effects of Camp” and move them into strategic jigsaw groups. Inform students that they will work with their small group to read one of the two remaining sections of the article titled “Postwar Impacts” or “Resilience and Positive Effects.” More than one small group will read each section. As they read, students should work with their group to annotate the text, jot down a gist in the margins at the end of each paragraph, and use strategies to determine unfamiliar vocabulary.

- Once students have finished reading their section of the article, refocus the class, and use equity sticks to review the gist of each paragraph and any unfamiliar vocabulary in the section “Postwar Impacts.” Students who read this section of the article will share, while other students will record the gists and vocabulary.

- Gists of “Postwar Impacts”:

- Paragraph 1: The closing of the camps did not end the psychological impacts of the incarceration; without jobs or hope, some Issei committed suicide.

- Paragraph 2: Almost all Nisei avoided talking about the camps; some avoided people of Japanese descent; others avoided Caucasian Americans.

- Paragraph 3: Most Nisei tried to keep a low profile after the war and focused on fitting in to American culture.

- Paragraph 4: The Sansei born after the war felt sadness and anger at their parents’ silence about their pain; many lost connections to their Japanese language and culture.

- With students’ support, record the meanings of *perpetrated* (committed or carried out an act like a crime), *trauma* (an emotional shock that has a deep effect on one’s life for a long time), *psychopathology* (psychological malfunctioning), and *aggressor* (a person, group, animal, or nation that attacks another) on the **academic word** **wall** and **domain** - **specific** **word** **wall**, with translations in students’ home languages. Write synonyms or sketch a visual above the words to scaffold students’ understanding. Invite students to record these words in their **vocabulary** **logs**.

- Ask students to review the gists of the second section of the article to prepare for writing a summary:

“What is a central idea that is developed in the second section of the article? What details develop this central idea?” (Responses will vary but should include: Central idea: “the closing of the camps did not end the psychological impacts of the incarceration.” Details: The Issei were often too old to return to work, so they became depressed; some even committed suicide. Most of the Nisei were ashamed and traumatized, so they didn’t speak of their camp experiences and tried to fit in to American culture. Many of the Sansei felt sadness and anger at their parents’ silence about their pain. Many also lost connection to their Japanese language and culture because their parents didn’t want to associate with Japanese culture.)

- Use equity sticks to review the gist of each paragraph and any unfamiliar vocabulary from the section “Resilience and Positive Effects.” Students who read this section of the article will share, while other students will record the gists and vocabulary.

- Gists of “Resilience and Positive Effects”:

- Paragraph 1: There were some positive effects of the incarceration: The incarcerees demonstrated resilience and resourcefulness in the camps, making art, improving living conditions, and learning new jobs. Some Nisei also relocated to the Midwest and East, which was stressful but broadened their horizons.

- Paragraph 2: Incarcerees supported one another and established strong, life-long connections; many Nisei went on to live successful lives; Sansei view their parents and grandparents as role models.

- Paragraph 3: The incarceration made Japanese Americans more aware of social justice issues and “watchful of policies and prejudices that unjustly target other groups.”

- With students’ support, record the meanings of *resilience* (the capacity to withstand and recover quickly from difficulty, sickness, or the like), and *resourcefulness* (capable of dealing with difficult situations quickly and imaginatively) on the academic word wall, with translations in students’ home languages. Write synonyms or sketch a visual above the words to scaffold students’ understanding. Invite students to record these words in their vocabulary logs.

- Ask students to review the gists of the third section of the article and use them to identify the central idea in preparation for writing a summary of this section.

“What is a central idea that is developed in the third section of the article? What details develop this central idea?” (Responses will vary but should include: Central idea: There were some positive effects of the incarceration. Details: Incarcerees demonstrated resilience and resourcefulness in the camps, making art, improving living conditions, and learning new jobs. Some Nisei also relocated to the Midwest and East, which was stressful but broadened their horizons. Also, the incarcerees supported one another and established strong, life-long connections. Additionally, many Nisei went on to live successful lives, and the Sansei view their parents and grandparents as role models. Finally, the incarceration made Japanese Americans more aware of social justice issues and “watchful of policies and prejudices that unjustly target other groups.”)

- Have students retrieve their Lessons from Internment note-catchers. Allow students a few minutes to work with their group to write a brief summary of the section of the article that they read in the appropriate box of their note-catchers. Consult the Lessons from Internment note-catchers (example for teacher reference).

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time A, invite students to highlight complex language structures they have worked with in Modules 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the article “Psychological Effects of Camp,” including relative clauses, gerunds, infinitives, participles, and verbs in the conditional and subjunctive moods. This will help students to review these structures and to unpack the meaning of each within this text. If time allows, dedicate time to talking through each of these together as a class, or pair students with supportive peers to interpret meaning in small-group discussions.

For Heavier Support

- In advance of Work Time A, highlight or underline potentially unfamiliar words and phrases in individual copies of “Psychological Effects of Camp” to draw students’ attention to this language (*anguish, cryptic, umber, bleak, resurrecting*). By helping students to make meaning of individual words and phrases used within these structures, students will be better able to parse the meaning of each sentence. If time allows, dedicate time to talking through each of these together as a class, or pair students with supportive peers to interpret meaning in small-group discussions.

- As time allows, to help students understand the difference in meanings created by relative clauses that start with *that* and relative clauses that start with *which*, use the following process:

- Display and read aloud the following sentence, which includes a relative clause that begins with *which* rather than *that*:

“Today, years after the successful redress effort, multiple generations of Japanese Americans remain watchful of policies and prejudices, which unjustly target other groups.”

- Remind students that from work earlier in this module, they know that commas indicate a pause or break in a sentence (L.8.2a). Point out that *which* is always preceded by a comma when it starts a relative clause. The comma indicates a break between a noun phrase and the relative clause that describes it, letting us know that this is extra information, but not information that is essential.

- Read the sentence aloud again, emphasizing the pause created by the comma before *which*. Cover the relative clause beginning with *which* with your hand. Ask:

“Does the sentence make sense without the relative clause?” (Yes, but we don’t know which specific policies and prejudices Japanese Americans are remaining watchful of without the relative clause.)

Work Time

B. Language Dive: “Psychological Effects of Camp,” Paragraph 14 – RI.8.2 (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can determine a central idea and analyze its development over the course of the article ‘Psychological Effects of Camp.’”

- Display the **Questions** **We** **Can** **Ask** **during** **a** **Language** **Dive** **anchor** **chart**. Ensure students understand how to use these questions, pointing out that the questions underlined on the anchor chart are questions that students should always ask when they dive into a sentence.

- Reread aloud paragraph 14 of “Psychological Effects of Camp.”

- Focus students on the sentence:

- “Today, years after the successful redress effort, multiple generations of Japanese Americans remain watchful of policies and prejudices that unjustly target other groups.”

- Use the **Language** **Dive** **Guide**: “ **Psychological** **Effects** **of** **Camp**,” **Paragraph** **14** (**for** **teacher** **reference**) and **Language** **Dive**: “ **Psychological** **Effects** **of** **Camp**,” **Paragraph** **14** **Sentence** **Chunk** **Chart** to guide students through a Language Dive conversation about the sentence. Distribute and display the **Language** **Dive**: “ **Psychological** **Effects** **of** **Camp**,” **Paragraph** **14** **note** - **catcher** and the **Language** **Dive**: “ **Psychological** **Effects** **of** **Camp**,” **Paragraph** **14** **sentence** **chunk** **strips**. Refer to **Language** **Dive**: “ **Psychological** **Effects** **of** **Camp**,” **Paragraph** **14** **note** - **catcher** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Closing and Assessment

A. Collaborative Discussion – SL.8.1 (10 minutes)

- Display the **Discussion** **Norms** **anchor** **chart**, and ask volunteers to review the Conversation Cues they can use to ask and answer relevant questions as well as acknowledge new information and qualify or justify their own views. Add any new sentence frames to the Discussion Norms anchor chart.

- Inform students that they will now engage in a collaborative discussion about the lessons from internment that they learned about in the article “Psychological Effects of Camps.” They should draw on their notes in their Lessons from Internment note-catcher as well as the article. Encourage each student to ask and answer at least one question and make one statement to acknowledge others’ ideas or justify or qualify their own ideas.

- Move students into strategic small groups, so each student has time to speak several times. As appropriate, consider giving each student three **objects** (like spoons, buttons, or paper clips) that they have to place in a communal **container** each time they participate in the discussion.

- Remind students that in this discussion they should draw on the evidence they have added to their Lessons from Internment note-catchers over the course of several lessons. They will add more evidence from the article to their note-catchers for homework.

- Begin the discussion(s) with the following prompt, but remind students that they will continue the discussion by asking and answering their own questions:

“What lessons from internment are conveyed in the article ‘Psychological Effects of Camp’? How are they conveyed? What do readers learn about Japanese Americans’ focus on ‘remaining watchful of policies and prejudices that unjustly target other groups’?” (For possible responses, consult the Lessons from Internment note-catcher (example for teacher reference).)

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- In Closing and Assessment A, invite students to generate sentence frames. This will not only help ELLs to navigate the discussion, but will also draw attention to language structure, which can benefit ELLs in their overall language development beyond this activity. By having students take ownership of creating their own frames, they will think critically about the objectives of the pair share and the practical and linguistic demands they will encounter during the activity.

For Heavier Support

- During the discussion in Closing and Assessment A, use strategic combinations of Conversation Cues to help students who need heavier support to be understood and to understand others:

- “I’ll give you a minute to think.”

- “Can you say more about that?”

- “So, do you mean \_\_\_\_\_?”

- “Who can repeat what your classmate said?”

Homework

A. Add Evidence to Lessons from Internment Note-Catcher

- Students add evidence from the article “Psychological Effects of Camp,” *Farewell to Manzanar*, and any other texts to their Lessons from Internment note-catchers.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent** **reading** **journal**.
