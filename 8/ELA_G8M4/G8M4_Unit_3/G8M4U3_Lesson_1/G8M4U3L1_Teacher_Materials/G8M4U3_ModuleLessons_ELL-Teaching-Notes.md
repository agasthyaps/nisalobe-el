English Language Learners: Grade 8: Module 4: Unit 3: Teaching Notes

Investigate, Discover, and Apply Lessons from Japanese American Internment

Teaching Notes for Unit 3

Prioritize Lessons for Classrooms with Many English Language Learners

In this unit, students will explore the enduring lessons we can learn from Japanese American internment and consider how these lessons can be applied today. In the first half of the unit, students read informational texts to understand the redress movement, the impact of Japanese American internment, and how survivors of Japanese American internment are applying lessons of internment through modern activism. The information that students will access through these texts builds an important foundation for the work students will carry out during the second half of the unit, in which they research how community organizations are applying lessons from Japanese American internment and then generate ideas for how these lessons can be applied in their own lives. The Language Dive in Lesson 3 and the optional Mini Language Dives in Lessons 1 and 4 should be prioritized to help students navigate the essential texts students will use to access information about the topic. Meanwhile, ELLs will especially benefit from strong support with planning and conducting interviews with local community organizations and in delivering presentations during the second half of the unit, as both require the careful application of listening and speaking skills.

Language Dives

In Lesson 3, students will participate in a Language Dive that focuses on a central idea in the article "Psychological Effects of Internment." This sentence also helps students to respond to the module guiding question (What are the main lessons that can be learned from Japanese American internment?) and to understand the big ideas (Upholding the rights of other human beings is critical work; In times of terrible struggle, people can draw strength from their identities and communities) because it provides information about how Japanese Americans are applying the lessons from Japanese American internment and provides a link between the struggle endured by Japanese American and strong habits of character. Furthermore, this Language Dive sentence features a relative clause, a language structure students have explored in earlier Language Dives and Mini Language Dives in this module, and one that they can directly apply to their speaking and writing. This Language Dive will help to prepare students for both the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment discussion and the End of Unit 3 Assessment presentations, both of which focus on lessons from Japanese American internment.

Module 4 Language Dives continue to follow a modified process that was introduced in Module 3. Modules 3 and 4 Language Dives provide options for questions and activities that continue to teach students how English works. This process allows students to take more of the lead in the conversation and build greater independence by taking an inquiry-based approach to language in general, and the selected sentence in particular. Although students should briefly discuss all chunks in each Language Dive sentence, the new format invites them to slow down during one chunk, called the focus structure, to investigate and practice a particularly compelling language structure.

Most Language Dives implicitly address a wide range of Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening, and Language standards. Once comfortable with Language Dives, supplement the focus standards in a particular Language Dive with additional standards to meet students’ needs. Note that the Rationale section of each Language Dive also identifies supporting standards that are explicitly addressed but are not the main focus of the Language Dive.

Language Chunk Wall

Continue to develop a Language Chunk Wall to extend student capacity to use Language Dive structures. The Language Chunk Wall, first introduced in Module 2, is an area in the classroom where students can display and categorize the academic phrases discussed in each Language Dive. At the end of each Language Dive, students are invited to place the Language Dive sentence chunk strips on the Language Chunk Wall into corresponding categories, such as “Nouns and Noun Phrases” or “Linking Language.” See each Language Dive for suggested categories. Color-code each category for additional support, for example, blue for nouns, pronouns, and subjects; red for predicates and verbs; yellow for adjectives; and green for adverbs, prepositions, and conjunctions. Students can then refer to the wall during subsequent speaking and writing tasks.

Mini Language Dives

Students have an opportunity to participate in Mini Language Dives beginning in Module 2, Unit 1. Mini Language Dives have the same overall purpose and follow the same general process as full Language Dives, but are condensed to 5 minutes, narrowing students’ attention on deconstructing the focus structure, reconstructing the sentence, and practicing the focus structure. Mini Language Dives give ELLs additional support in building language and literacy skills, as well as habits of mind. Mini Language Dives are most often optional and can be found in the corresponding lessons within this guide. When required for all students, Mini Language Dives are built into the body of the lesson in the Teacher Guide. In this unit, optional Mini Language Dives appear in Lessons 1 and 4. Work in the Mini Language Dives in Lessons 1 and 4 are designed to help students understand the central ideas of texts and to deepen their thinking around the impacts of the redress movement and how lessons from Japanese American internment are being applied today. Work in these Mini Language Dives will help to prepare students for the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment discussion and the End of Unit 3 Assessment presentations.

Diversity and Inclusion

Investigate the routines, practices, rituals, beliefs, norms, and experiences that are important to ELLs and their families. Integrate this background into the classroom as students explore Japanese American internment. Be mindful that students will have varying degrees of familiarity with and sensitivity to the topic.

Be mindful of ELLs’ formal schooling experiences, degree of home- and English-language development, length of time in the United States and in US schools, and family backgrounds. These variables impact the ways in which students will progress in their English language acquisition across the domains of speaking, listening, reading, and writing. Depending on their background, ELLs may often have strong oral proficiency in their home language with less proficiency in reading and writing. Likewise, the oral English language proficiency of ELLs may be more highly developed than their abilities in comprehending and producing written language. In light of this, give consideration to when ELLs might be struggling with content and when they are struggling with the skill-specific proficiency needed to understand what they read or to express concepts in writing. Use multimodal input on topics simultaneously (e.g., read-alouds) to help students begin to align their proficiency in receptive skills (listening/reading) and in their productive skills (speaking/writing). Provide continued opportunities for students to express their understanding of topics orally.

Look for ways to provide opportunities to draw on and incorporate students’ home languages into their learning. Support ELLs in strategically using their home language in the classroom to enrich their engagement with tasks and to deepen their understanding of content and concepts. Encourage students to engage in discussions in home language groups, to reflect in writing in their home language, and to make connections between linguistic features of the English language and their home language. For content-based tasks, when possible, provide translated texts and audiovisual materials to help ELLs gain access to topics in their home language.

Create a supportive and inclusive classroom environment by reminding students that everyone is working toward improvement. Be sure to highlight and praise growth and development rather than relative performance. Use as a topic or text warmer or reflection with the entire class: a check-in at any strategic point during the unit to continually connect students’ personal experiences to the topic or text and to share how each one has changed and grown in association with the other. Invite students to share any cultural connections they may have made with the text and topic. Foster inclusive action by creating space for students to express their feelings about Japanese American internment, knowing that these discussions may help create equity or unearth injustices, or both. Consult with a guidance counselor, school social worker, or ESL teacher for further investigation of diversity and inclusion.

Conversation Cues

Encourage productive and equitable conversation with Conversation Cues, which are questions that help students achieve four goals:

- (Goal 1) encourage all students to talk and be understood;

- (Goal 2) listen carefully to one another and seek to understand;

- (Goal 3) deepen thinking; and

- (Goal 4) think with others to expand the conversation (adapted from Michaels, Sarah, and Cathy O’Connor. *Talk Science Primer*. TERC, 2012. http://inquiryproject.terc.edu/shared/pd/TalkScience_Primer.pdf. Based on Chapin, S., O’Connor, C., and Anderson, N. \[2009\]. *Classroom Discussions: Using Math Talk to Help Students Learn, Grades K–6*. Second Edition. Math Solutions Publications).

Refer to the Tools page (http://eled.org/tools) for the complete set of of Conversation Cues. Goals 1–4 Conversation Cues were introduced in Modules 1–3, and all will continue to be used throughout this module. Suggestions for integrating Conversation Cues into instruction are presented across lessons. For ELLs, Conversation Cues are especially critical because they improve language processing abilities and increase engagement and participation.

Use Conversation Cues as often as possible to gradually release thinking and expression of ideas to students; avoid using Conversation Cues as a way of searching for the “right” answer. Students often struggle to create productive and equitable conversation during Turn and Talk or Think-Pair-Share protocols; Conversation Cues can make the difference. Recall that the main goals of Conversation Cues are supporting students to express their ideas (Goal 1), listen to other students’ ideas (Goal 2), deepen their own ideas (Goal 3), and build on other students’ ideas (Goal 4).

Consider this model transcription from a classroom where about eighty-five percent of students are ELLs. The teacher is supporting students to build their ideas about the choice an author made when writing this sentence about an athlete’s factors for success: *There were many factors that led to Rickey’s success, but it was support from others in baseball that was most important.* Students can carry the Conversation Cues into small groups to support their own independent productive and equitable conversations.

Mr. Valencia: What if I replace **but** with **and**? **And** is also a conjunction. How would **and** change the meaning? I'll give you some time to think. Emma, you want to give it a shot?

Emma: It is adding on to the, like, the idea, of the first (part of the) sentence?

Mr. Valencia: Can anyone repeat or rephrase what Emma just said?

Santiago: It would have the same idea as the first two chunks.

Mr. Valencia: Right, **and** would have the same idea as the first two chunks. Two connecting, same ideas. So how does **but** change that for me? Jazmin?

Jazmin: **But** would change it.

Mr. Valencia: Can you say more about that, Jazmin?

Jazmin: It would change it because **but** would say there are many things happening, but this is the one.

Mr. Valencia: So does anyone want to add something else to that?

Daniel: **But** is saying this is the main thing happening.

Mr. Valencia: Right, now the sentence is going to the main factor (for success), or a contrast. **But** is something that is going to tell us a contrast. (Exchange continues.)

Strategic Grouping

Students work in pairs and small groups during text-based discussions, Language Dives, and other tasks. For Language Dives and other tasks that focus on language, match ELLs with a partner who has greater language proficiency. For text-based discussions that focus on argument and structure, pair ELLs with students who share the same home language to allow for rich discussion around ideas. The conversations that happen as a result of such strategic pairing will greatly serve the language development of both partners.

In this unit, thoughtful strategic grouping will be especially important when organizing students into triads for the End of Unit 3 Assessment presentations and the Activist Assembly focus groups during the performance task. Consider forming home language groupings with students of varying proficiencies to balance opportunities for rich discussion in home languages with peer modeling and support in navigating the tasks at hand.

In-Class Reading

In this unit, students will read a series of short informational texts to understand the repercussions and lessons from Japanese American internment and how these lessons are being applied today. ELLs benefit from a gradual-release approach to in-class reading that increases their level of independence over time. For heavier support, ELLs may find it helpful to follow along during a read-aloud, and for lighter support, students can take turns reading aloud from the text and following along in small groups.

Text-Based Discussions

As in Modules 1–3, break down content, share-outs, or tasks into two parts for ELLs: cognitive and linguistic. First, invite home language use to allow students to more comfortably process their ideas. This will allow students to first focus on the cognitive demands necessary to complete particularly demanding content, share-outs, or tasks. In addition, inviting home language use helps students build academic mindsets. After they have met the cognitive demands in their home language, they can be invited to discuss the task in classroom English, a language they are still learning.

Differentiated Materials

Differentiated materials are available for ELLs and other students who would benefit from an increased level of support. These resources have been modified for the purposes of creating accessibility to content and concepts and supporting language development. Depending upon the task being carried out, images, selected response options, answer banks, sentence frames, or model responses have been embedded to guide students’ thinking without compromising a focus on standards and the skills that students are developing and applying to meet them.

Celebration

Celebrate the courage, enthusiasm, diversity, and bilingual assets that ELLs bring to the classroom. Additionally, students can celebrate their successful attempts at communication, focusing on progress rather than perfection.
