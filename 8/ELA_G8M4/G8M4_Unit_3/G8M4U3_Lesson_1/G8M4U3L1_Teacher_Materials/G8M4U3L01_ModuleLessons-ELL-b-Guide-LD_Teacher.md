5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

RI.8.1, RI.8.2, RI.8.6, L.8.2a, L.8.1c, L.8.3a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

The simplest and clearest lesson from the exclusion and internment is that it is wrong to view entire populations as monoliths and attribute to all members of a group—**be they Japanese or Muslims or Mexicans or Iranians or even Americans**—the characteristics of a few. (from paragraph 9 of “The Lesson of Internment Is Still Relevant Today”)

**Lesson 1 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after Work Time B.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target (**I can determine a central idea and analyze its development over the course of a text about Japanese American internment**) and RI.8.2 by clearly stating a lesson from Japanese American internment. The sentence also helps to address RI.8.1 and RI.8.6 by providing textual evidence of the author’s point of view that internment was caused by dangerous beliefs and shameful practices. The sentence also helps students to address L.8.2a, as it uses dashes to offset examples within the sentence, as well as L.8.1c and L.8.3a, because it uses a subjunctive verb (**be they**). Supporting standard: L.8.4b.

- Module Guiding Question: The sentence helps students respond to the guiding question (**What are the main lessons that can be learned from Japanese American internment?**) by directly providing one lesson from Japanese American internment.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses dashes to offset examples within a clause. It also uses a set phrase, **be they**, in the subjunctive mood, to introduce hypothetical examples.

- Transfer: **—be they** + noun phrase + **—** to insert examples into a sentence when writing. Students may also use **be they** to provide examples during the discussion in the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment and during their presentations in the End of Unit 3 Assessment.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **The simplest and clearest lesson from the exclusion and internment is that it is wrong to view entire populations as monoliths and attribute to all members of a group <u>—be they Japanese or Muslims or Mexicans or Iranians or even Americans—</u> the characteristics of a few**.

- Ask:

“What is this sentence about?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“Can you figure out the meaning of monoliths using your affix list?” (The affix mono- means alone or single. The word monoliths is used in this sentence to refer to a large, impersonal, uniform group of people.)

- As time allows, invite students to use a dictionary to look up the meaning of **monoliths**.

- Ask:

“Why do you think the writer uses dashes at the beginning and end of this chunk?”  
(To separate examples from the rest of the sentence. The dashes indicate a brief pause, which helps the reader to focus on the information between them.)

“What are these examples of?” (groups of people with shared ethnic, national, or religious identities)

“How is be they different from for example?” (Be they suggests that these are hypothetical, not specific, concrete examples. It tells us that these examples could be extended to include other possibilities.)

- Tell students that **be they** is a collocation (a fixed phrase) that uses the subjunctive mood to introduce hypothetical possibilities or examples. It is used mostly in writing or in more formal speaking contexts, like when participating in a formal discussion giving a presentation.

“How can we use be they in our speaking or writing?” (Responses will vary, but help students to recognize that they can use this phrase during the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment discussion and during their presentations at the End of Unit 3 Assessment as well as when writing summaries or essays.)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **The simplest and clearest lesson from the exclusion and internment is that it is wrong to view entire populations as monoliths and attribute to all members of a group<u>—be they Japanese or Muslims or Mexicans or Iranians or even Americans—</u>the characteristics of a few.**

- Ask:

“What happens if we remove the dashes and information between them?” (The sentence still makes sense, but we lose important examples that help us to think more deeply about the idea being presented.)

“How does this sentence help us understand the central idea of the article?” (It clearly states a lesson from Japanese American internment, which is that we shouldn’t think that all people from a particular ethic, national, or religious group are all the same based on a few people.)

“Can you figure out the author’s point of view toward Japanese American internment?” (The author’s point of view toward internment is that the Japanese American incarceration is a shameful and ugly part of our past, and we need to ensure we do not allow it to happen ever again.)

- Ask:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the module guiding question: What are the main lessons that can be learned from Japanese American internment?” (Responses will vary.)
