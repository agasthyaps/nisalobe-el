What are the main lessons that can be learned from Japanese American internment?

- *It is wrong to view entire populations as homogeneous.*

- *Upholding the rights of other human beings is critical work.*

- *In times of terrible struggle, people can draw strength from their identities and communities.*

How can people effectively apply the lessons of Japanese American internment to their own communities?

- *The redress movement, which began in the 1970s, has aimed to restore the rights of, issue an apology to, and/or monetarily compensate the survivors of internment.*

- *Local organizations can uphold human rights, celebrate diversity, support community.*

What will your student be doing at school?

In this unit, students focus on understanding key lessons from Japanese American internment. In the first half of the unit, students read a series of informational texts to understand the redress movement and the long-term impact and effects of Japanese American internment. From their reading of these texts, students generate enduring lessons from internment and then find evidence from the anchor text, *Farewell to Manzanar*, and other supplemental texts read in Unit 2 to deepen their understanding of these lessons. For example, students will use text-based evidence to identify the lesson that that in times of terrible struggle, people can draw strength from their identities and communities. They also engage in collaborative discussions. This work prepares students for the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment, a text-based discussion on lessons from Japanese American internment and the redress movement.

In the second half of Unit 3, students explore modern activism and how lessons from Japanese American internment are being applied today. Students research and interview community organizations to understand how their work connects to lessons from Japanese American internment. For example, students might explore how an organization that helps refugees embodies lessons from Japanese American internment. For the End of Unit 3 Assessment, students deliver presentations in triads on the community organizations they have selected. Students then prepare for the final performance task of the module: the Activist Assembly. During the Activist Assembly, students participate in focus groups with other triads of students and guests (family, friends, and community members) to uplift the work of the organizations they researched and to further consider how lessons from Japanese American internment can be applied today.

Central to the EL Education curriculum is a focus on “habits of character” and social-emotional learning. With this in mind, students work on various habits of character throughout the curriculum:

- Work to Become Effective Learners: developing mindsets and skills for success in college, career, and life (e.g., initiative, responsibility, perseverance, collaboration)

- Work to Become Ethical People: treating others well and standing up for what is right (e.g., empathy, integrity, respect, compassion)

- Work to Contribute to a Better World: putting their learning to use to improve communities (e.g., citizenship, service).

Working to Contribute to a Better World is the habit of character emphasized in this unit. These are the specific skills students will focus on:

- I use my strengths to help others grow: This means that I use my understanding of the lessons from Japanese American internment to help others perceive injustices and to speak out against them.

- I apply my learning to help our school, the community, and the environment: This means that I convey the lessons from Japanese American internment to members of my school and local communities and help them understand how community organizations embody lessons from Japanese American internment. I also consider the actions I can take to apply the lessons from Japanese American internment in my daily life to contribute to a better world.

How can you support your student at home?

Talk to your student about the guiding questions, particularly if any of the topics raised might be sensitive for your student or family.

Talk to your student about the texts he or she is reading in the classroom, particularly if any of the topics raised might be sensitive for your student.

Reach out to teachers if you have any questions or concerns about the text.

Talk to your student about modern activism. Discuss other examples of local, national, and international organizations that focus on social justice causes.

Watch films and research on the internet with your student to find out more about modern activism that focuses on social justice issues.

Read informational books and articles with your student, and discuss. What important events did you learn about? How did these events impact the individuals?

Act as an audience for your student as they practice reading aloud phone scripts and interview questions in preparation for phone interviews with community organizations.

Act as an audience for your student as they practice their presentations on how community organizations embody lessons from Japanese American internment.

Help your student to prepare for the focus group during the final performance task by engaging in practice discussions in which they can rehearse what they might say in their role as greeter, emcee, facilitator, or group participant.

Unit 3: Homework

Students engage in one kind of reading for homework, with choice reading as an additional option.

**Independent research reading:** When not reading their anchor text, your student is expected to independently research the topic. In the first lesson, students complete both types of reading as both independent research reading and the anchor text are introduced. When not assigned readings in the anchor text, students read topic-related books of their choice for approximately 20 minutes <u>each day</u> and respond to a prompt of choice in the <u>front</u> of the independent reading journal. These are usually books your student will bring home from school; however, they may be topic-related books chosen by your student at the public or your home library. Prompts for independent reading can be found in the homework materials provided.

**Choice reading:** If your student would also like to independently read and respond to a book of free choice, he or she may use the <u>back</u> of the independent reading journal. Prompts for independent reading can be found in the homework materials provided.

Independent Reading

**Directions:** Remember to record responses to research reading in the front of your independent reading journal and responses to choice reading in the back. Try to choose a different prompt each time.

Record any new vocabulary in your vocabulary log. Underline vocabulary found during independent reading.

**Record:**

- Date

- Title and author of your reading book

- Pages you have read

- Prompt

- Response

**Example:**

<u>Date:</u> 10/13/2020

<u>Book Title and Author:</u> *Farewell to Manzanar* by Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston and James D. Houston

<u>Pages Read:</u> 178–188

<u>Prompt:</u> Which habits of character are demonstrated in the text? Explain.

<u>Response:</u> In the afterword of *Farewell to Manzanar*, the authors make an important point about how we must never forget the lessons of Manzanar. Specifically, we must continue to disapprove of unfair treatment of racial and ethnic groups. This demonstrates working to become ethical people habits of character. It reminds us to behave with integrity and to stand up against injustice. It also reminds us to be respectful of all people by applying the lessons we have learned from terrible events in history.

**Consider using the following independent reading prompts.**[^1]

- How does this text add to your understanding of one of the guiding questions of the module?

- Which habits of character are demonstrated in the text? Explain.

- What is the central idea or theme of the text? How was this idea developed?

- Record two or three facts in your own words that you learned from the text.

- Summarize your research reading today in no more than five sentences.

- What major ideas are present in the text you read? Give text details that convey those details.

- What questions do you have about the topic after reading?

- Choose one new word from your reading today, and analyze it on a vocabulary square.

| **Definition in your own words**                  | **Synonyms (words with the same meaning)** |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Words with the same affix or root**             | **Sketch**                                 |
| **Translation in home language** (if appropriate) |                                            |

Vocabulary

**Directions:** In the classroom, you have been recording words from your texts in your vocabulary log. Throughout this unit, you have been research reading topic-related books at home to build your knowledge of Japanese American internment and recording words in your independent reading journal.

Choose a word from your research reading or from a text you’ve read in class, and add the word to your vocabulary log. Try to choose a different word to add and to practice a different vocabulary strategy each time. For each word, be sure to add the following:

1.  The definition, or meaning, of the word

<!-- -->

3.  The vocabulary strategy you used to figure out the meaning of the word

4.  A sketch or diagram that helps you to better understand the meaning of the word

Record new vocabulary in your vocabulary log, and mark academic vocabulary with a symbol, for example, a star:

- Academic vocabulary: words you might find in informational texts on many different topics. For example, the words *evidence* and *rationale* are words that could be found in books on any topic.

- Domain-specific vocabulary: words about a particular topic. For example, the words *tadpoles*, *frogspawn*, and *amphibian* are some that would be found on the topic of frogs.

**Vocabulary Strategies**

As a reminder, the vocabulary strategies we’ve been working on in class are listed below:

- Context: read the sentence around the word.

- Look at the affixes for clues.

- Look at the root of the word for clues.

- Use a dictionary.

- Discuss the word with another person (after attempting some of the above strategies).

[^1]: Some of the prompts will not be appropriate for the text students are reading. Invite students to choose a prompt that works for the text they have just read.
