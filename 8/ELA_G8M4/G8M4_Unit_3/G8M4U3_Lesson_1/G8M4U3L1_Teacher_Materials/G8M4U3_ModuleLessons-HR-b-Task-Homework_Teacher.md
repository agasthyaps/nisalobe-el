RI.8.1, RI.8.3

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Review the articles read in class during this lesson: “Seeking Redress” and “The Simplest Lesson of Internment.” Then respond in writing to the following questions.

1.  What connection or distinction do you see among these two new texts and *Farewell to Manzanar* with regard to language use concerning terms such as **internment** and **incarceration**? What is the effect of this connection or distinction?

Responses will vary, but may include: One distinction is that these articles use different language to refer to what the authors of *Farewell to Manzanar* refer to as the *internment*—they call it *incarceration* or *imprisonment*. The effect of the terms is that *internment* is milder and makes the experience seem less harsh; whereas *incarceration* or *imprisonment* more accurately describes the experiences of the incarcerees.

2.  What connection or distinction do you see among these two new texts and *Farewell to Manzanar* with regard to the US Supreme Court cases? What is the effect of this connection or distinction?

Responses will vary, but may include: One connection is that chapter 16 of the text mentions some of the US Supreme Court cases that helped to overturn the order and began the process toward closing the camps. The effect of this connection is that we see that the authors of *Farewell to Manzanar* do recognize the injustice of internment/imprisonment.

3.  What connection or distinction do you see among these two new texts and *Farewell to Manzanar* with regard to redress? What is the effect of this connection or distinction?

Responses will vary, but may include: One connection is that chapter 19 of the text discusses some of the redress efforts for the family. The effect of this connection is that we see that the authors of *Farewell to Manzanar* do recognize the need for redress.
