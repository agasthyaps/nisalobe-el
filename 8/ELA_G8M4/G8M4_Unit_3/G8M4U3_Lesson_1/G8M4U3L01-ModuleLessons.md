Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.8.1 – Opening A: On an entrance ticket, students use evidence from the text to answer a question.

- RI.8.2 – Work Time A: Students add annotations to “Seeking Redress” with the purpose of identifying the central idea of the text.

- RI.8.6 – Work Time A: Students add annotations to “Seeking Redress” with the purpose of identifying the author’s point of view and how it differs from other points of view.

- RI.8.6 – Work Time B: Students add annotations to “The Simplest Lesson of Internment” with the purpose of identifying the author’s point of view and how it differs from other points of view.

- In this lesson, students engage in a protocol. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning. Protocols are an important feature of the EL curriculum because they are a useful way to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. Students engage in the following new protocol in this lesson (instructions for which appear at the first point of use):

- **Annotating** **Text** goes beyond underlining, highlighting, or making symbolic notations or codes on a given text. Annotation includes adding purposeful notes, key words and phrases, definitions, and connections tied to specific sections of text. Annotating text promotes student interest in reading and gives learners a focused purpose for writing. It supports readers’ ability to clarify and synthesize ideas, pose relevant questions, and capture analytical thinking about text. Annotation also gives students a clear purpose for actively engaging with text and is driven by the goals or learning targets of the lesson.

- Beginning in Lesson 6 of this unit, students conduct research to learn more about activist organizations whose work embodies lessons from internment in their communities. If not completed in Unit 2, carefully consider now the span of the community within which students should operate. In urban areas with large populations, it may be sufficient to consider the community to be the neighborhood or city within which students live. In smaller towns, it may be necessary to expand the definition of community to include neighboring cities, counties, or regions in the country.

- Successful participation in Unit 3, Lessons 6–12, requires that students are able to reach a local organization by phone and interview a representative of that organization. Ensure that students are able to make contact with organizations by beginning now to develop a short list of prevetted organizations. Begin to reach out to these organizations now to gauge their willingness to be interviewed and let them know of the date when they may expect a call. In Lesson 6, students will be assigned one of the organizations from the list as one of the three organizations they research and prepare to interview.

- Reach out to these organizations before Lesson 6 to explain the project, gauge their willingness to be interviewed, and let them know of the date when they might expect a call from students. A sample email script can be found below:

- Good morning!

My name is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_, and I am a Grade 8 ELA instructor at \_\_\_\_\_\_\_. My students have been studying Japanese American internment, focusing on the overarching lessons, or enduring understandings, that can be learned from this dark time in history. These lessons include “Upholding the rights of other human beings is critical work” and “It is wrong to view entire populations as homogeneous.”

Now, we turn to their own community. In groups, students will conduct research about local organizations that, in their own way and with their own target populations, embody these enduring understandings and contribute to a better world.

I am writing to see if you or someone from your organization might be available for a phone interview with one of these groups of eighth-graders. They will ask you questions about the work your organization does and how it connects to these enduring understandings that they have identified. Students will be conducting some of their own research into local organizations, but I am hoping to make a few prevetted organizations available to them, including yours. If students were to call, it would be on \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \[date\] at around \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \[time\]. The interview should take no more than 5 minutes. Students will then use your answers to participate in a class discussion about the best ways to apply these lessons to activist work in their own community.

Please let me know if you (or someone in your organization) are available to be an interviewee for a group of students. Thank you!

- If phones are not available or practical, students should plan to contact organizations via email. If so, change the above email script to reference students sending emails.

- Also, at this time, invite community members such as other students, teachers, family members, and people associated with the prevetted organizations to join in the Activist Assembly for the performance task at the end of this unit. Students may want to create formal, written invitations to send to these community members.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Although the Annotating Text protocol is typically done silently, consider inviting students to think aloud with a partner as they annotate “Seeking Redress” in Work Time A. Listening partners can follow along and note the annotation choices made by their partners, and then ask one another questions about their approaches to annotation.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students completed the End of Unit 2 Assessment, in which they wrote their independent literary argument essays. This unit builds on the knowledge they have developed while reading *Farewell to Manzanar* and extends that learning by bringing in additional texts and points of view.

Support All Students

- The Annotating Text protocol helps readers to process information at a deeper level and increases their ability to recall information from the text. It helps learners comprehend difficult materials and more critically engage with the text. Although this protocol is supportive for students at all reading levels, it may be especially useful for ELLs, who benefit from opportunities to gauge and demonstrate their understanding of the text. ▲

- If ELLs find it challenging to locate words, phrases, and sentences to annotate during the protocol, consider giving them the opportunity to annotate for different purposes, such as to react or reflect, or to pose clarifying questions to the author. ▲

- In Closing and Assessment A, students reflect on their experience annotating the text. Provide multiple options for how to carry out this work. Some students, particularly ELLs, may benefit from reflecting orally, while others may process best in writing. If possible, build in opportunities to do both. Allow ELLs to reflect in their home languages first to reduce linguistic interference with the task at hand. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson supports students in understanding an informational text about the Japanese American internment redress movement and lessons from Japanese American internment. Students engage in supported in-class reading, guided annotation work, and collaborative exchanges. The sequence of the lesson follows a gradual-release approach in which students annotate a text together and then work more independently to annotate a second text. Work in this lesson helps to prepare students for the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment, in which they will discuss lessons from Japanese American internment; time to reflect in the closing of the lessons invites students to make connections between the articles they read in this lesson and the module topic.

- ELLs may find it challenging to navigate the information in the texts in this lesson and to annotate these texts effectively within a short period of time. Some students may need heavier support with annotating the texts. Consider using home language grouping in this lesson to allow for rich exchanges around the ideas and information presented in the text to help ELLs comprehend the information.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6, 8.I.B.8, 8.II.A.1, and 8.II.A.2.

Assessment Guidance

- In this lesson, students learn to annotate a text as they read to deepen their comprehension. Consider creating standard annotations for students to draw from (e.g., circle unfamiliar words, highlight key details, draw a question mark next to confusing parts). Create an anchor chart with the different possible annotations, and encourage students to add to it with their own ideas. Remind students to use annotations in moderation, as they are meant to draw their attention only to the most important ideas.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a close read of an additional supplemental text, “Psychological Effects of Camp,” analyzing vocabulary and determining central ideas.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare:

- Text: “Seeking Redress”

- Text: “The Simplest Lesson of Internment”

- Ensure there is a copy of Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 1 at each student’s workspace.

- A think-aloud is used in Work Time A of this lesson. Rehearse the think-aloud, emphasizing the steps that are likely to be most challenging for students, to sound natural and reflect the actual metacognitive process in which students will engage.

- Review the student tasks and example answers to get familiar with what students will be required to do in the lesson. Consider annotating both articles, “Seeking Redress” and “The Simplest Lesson of Internment,” in preparation for guiding students in annotation.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous modules to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.8.1 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with previous lessons to distribute and review the **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **3**, **Lesson** **1**. Refer to the **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **3**, **Lesson** **1** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) for possible responses. Students may need additional time to process the new definition of *concentration* *camp*. If so, encourage them to discuss further in pairs, small groups, or as a class. If discussions become tense, encourage students to write about their thoughts, feelings, and ideas. Also, remind students of their habits of character, and encourage them to show respect, empathy, and compassion toward their classmates.

- Explain that students will be participating in an Annotating Text protocol to collaboratively examine a text about Japanese American internment.

- Ask:

“What root word do you see in the word *annotate*?” (note)

“When we annotate a text, what do we do to it?” (We add notes and comments to it.)

“Why can it be helpful to take the time to annotate a text?” (Taking notes on a text helps us engage with the text and see what we understand and what we have questions about.)

- Add the word *annotate* to the **academic** **word** **wall**, and invite students to record it in their **vocabulary** **logs**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons. Invite students to choose a habit of character focus for themselves for this lesson.

Work Time

A. Read and Annotate “Seeking Redress” – RI.8.2, RI.8.6 (20 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Review the learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson.

“I can determine a central idea and analyze its development over the course of a text about Japanese American internment.”

“I can analyze how the authors’ point of view is conveyed and differs from other points of view in a text about Japanese American internment.”

- Focus students on the **Close** **Readers** **Do** **These** **Things** **anchor** **chart**, and remind them that digging into a text deeply can help them understand it better, so they are going to dig deeply into an article titled “Seeking Redress” through annotation.

- With students’ support, record the meaning of *redress* (relief from a wrong, setting things right), *reparations* (restoration or compensation for a wrong or injustice), *pilgrimage* (a journey to a sacred place), and *wartime* *hysteria* (during war, an outburst of fear producing irrational behavior) on the **domain** - **specific** **word** **wall**, with translations in students’ home languages. Write synonyms or sketch a visual above the words to scaffold students’ understanding. Invite students to record these words in their vocabulary logs.

- Ensure students understand the directions for the Annotating Text protocol.

- Define and display the purpose for annotating “Seeking Redress”: to analyze the author’s point of view.

- Distribute and display **Text**: “ **Seeking** **Redress**.” Explain that students will first follow along as you model how to annotate the first two paragraphs of the text.

- Highlight or underline key words, phrases, or sentences from the first paragraph of the text. Note the sample annotations to the first two paragraphs of “Seeking Redress,” and use a think-aloud strategy to help students understand the purpose of highlighting those key words, phrases, or sentences (to help them identify points of view).

- Field any questions students have about the protocol. Remind students that the think-aloud was meant to model the kinds of choices students might make as they annotate texts; the protocol itself will be done silently.

- Remind students of the two purposes for annotating the text, and invite them to independently annotate the third and fourth paragraphs of “Seeking Redress.” After a few minutes, invite students to Turn and Talk to a partner about what they underlined and how they annotated it in the margins. Use this as an opportunity to gauge students’ understanding of the article and the protocol.

- Tell students that they will now work with a partner to read aloud, think aloud, and then write their annotations for paragraphs 5 and 6. Explain to students that they do not have to write down the same information as their partner, but reiterate the importance of students explaining their thinking.

- Turn and Talk:

“What habits of character do you need to exhibit to be successful in this activity?” (Responses will vary, but may include: respect, collaboration, initiative, and responsibility.)

- Once students have finished annotating paragraphs 5 and 6, use **equity** **sticks** to choose two students to share their annotations.

- Inform students that they will now independently annotate the rest of the article for key words, phrases, and sentences that help them identify points of view. Explain that the think-aloud technique is still appropriate, but the technique should now be a silent mental process the students use to guide their thinking.

- Invite students to begin annotating. Monitor student progress, and assist any students who seem to be struggling.

- Once they have finished annotating the text, remind students that they’ve been annotating for point of view and in the process, they likely noted the central idea of the text. Then ask:

“What would you say is the central idea of this text?” (Responses will vary, but may include: the US government finally did take some steps to both acknowledge the wrongs committed against and compensate people of Japanese descent who were unjustly incarcerated.)

- Invite students to join with another partnership to form groups of four. Then ask students to Think-Group-Share:

“According to your annotations, what would you say is the author’s point of view toward internment? Toward the redress actions undertaken? What evidence from the article shows this point of view?” (Responses will vary, but may include: The author’s point of view toward internment is that the incarceration was a grave injustice, using words like “suffering” \[1\] and “ordeal of imprisonment” \[5\] the author’s point of view toward the redress actions seems to be that they were an important step, but that in some ways it was too little and too late, showing the perspective of some Japanese Americans: “They argued that no amount of money could heal the ordeal of imprisonment during World War Two” \[5\]. The author also suggests a link toward the kinds of attitudes that permitted the incarceration in concentration camps to some current attitudes toward other groups of people in the United States: “They speak out in defense of other minorities that have come under attack. That includes American Muslims since 9/11 and other immigrant groups in the era of Donald Trump” \[9\].)

“According to your annotations, how does the author differentiate between their point of view and other points of view?” (Responses will vary, but may include: the author indicates that some people thought redress movements would increase anti-Japanese sentiment.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time A, provide a short summary of the article to students before they begin reading and annotating to help guide their process. This will give students a big-picture sense of the text before they read, which will help draw their attention to important information.

- To extend work with *be they* after the Mini Language Dive, guide students through a short discussion of connotation (L.8.5c) of different phrases used to introduce examples (*be they, for example, whether that’s*). Help students to distinguish between the formality of each one, and invite students to consider how they might use each in different speaking and writing contexts.

Work Time

B. Read and Annotate “The Simplest Lesson of Internment” – RI.8.6 (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson.

- Distribute and display **Text**: “ **The** **Simplest** **Lesson** **of** **Internment**.”

- Define and display the purpose for annotating “The Lessons of Internment Are Relevant Today”: to analyze the author’s point of view and how it differs from other points of view.

- Inform students that they will read and annotate this short rest of the article with a partner. Invite students to begin annotating. Monitor student progress, and assist any students who seem to be struggling.

- When students have finished reading and annotating, use a total participation technique to review student annotations. Explain that students will further engage with the text for homework.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- After Work Time B, invite students to participate in a Mini Language Dive in small groups to explore how a sentence presents the central idea of a text (RI.8.2) and an important lesson from Japanese American internment. The sentence also helps to address RI.8.1 and RI.8.6 by providing textual evidence of the author’s point of view that internment was caused by dangerous beliefs and shameful practices. The sentence also helps students to address L.8.2a, as it uses dashes to offset examples within the sentence, as well as L.8.1c and L.8.3a, because it uses a subjunctive verb (*be they*) to introduce hypothetical examples.

For Heavier Support

N/A

Closing and Assessment

A. Reflection (5 minutes)

- Invite students to reflect on the Annotating Text protocol. Then ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What do these two texts add to your understanding of our module topic?” (Responses will vary.)

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Analyze Connections and Distinctions

- Students analyze how the articles read in class make connections and distinctions among individuals, ideas, and events as compared to *Farewell to Manzanar* to complete **Homework**: **Connections** **and** **Distinctions** **across** **Texts**.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent** **reading** **journal**.
