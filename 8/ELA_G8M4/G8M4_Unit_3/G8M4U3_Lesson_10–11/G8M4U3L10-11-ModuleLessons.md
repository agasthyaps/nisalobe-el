Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Work Time A: Students complete the Module 4, Unit 3, end of unit assessment during which they work in triads to present information about the organization they researched using their visual display. Each member of the triad will participate in presenting information about the focus questions: (1) What is the organization, and what kind of work does it do? (2) How does the organization’s work connect to lessons of internment? (3) How can people get involved with this organization, and how can they carry out similar work in their own lives for their own communities? The assessment focuses on the use of the visual aid to enhance the presentation and the use of formal language while presenting (SL.8.5, SL.8.6, L.8.6).

- In Opening A, students’ Mid-Unit 3 Assessments are returned with feedback. This allows students the opportunity to see how they performed in order to improve in their next assessment and to ask questions if they don’t understand the feedback.

- The assessment can be arranged in different ways depending on the schedule, location, and number of teachers available to complete the End of Unit 3 Assessment: Activist Organization Presentation Scoring. As each triad presents to the entire class, fill in the first part of the End of Unit 3 Assessment: Activist Organization Presentation Scoring, focusing on just one triad at a time. Presentations could also be recorded and revisited to fill in the End of Unit 3 Assessment: Activist Organization Presentation Scoring later.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Create an air of celebration around the presentations. Invite outside audience members, such as administrators, parents, or other students for either this lesson or the next.

- Students who excel at graphic design could be tasked with creating promotional materials, such as fliers, posters, and programs, for the presentations and/or the Activist Assembly in the next lesson. Allow students to experiment with a free online design tool, such as http://eled.org/0254, to create these materials.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Students have created their visual display and rehearsed their presentation in triads for today’s lesson.

Support All Students

- Students may need additional support in delivering their presentations. Encourage students to develop flashcards that they can use to organize key talking points and pronunciation reminders. ▲

- Students who are unable to present to a larger audience could video record their presentation, and this could be played to the audience instead of being presented live.

- Students may be apprehensive about sharing their work in a presentation to an audience. Allow time for final oral rehearsal of presentations immediately before the assessment. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson is devoted to an End of Unit 3 Assessment that builds off the preparation students have carried out in the previous four lessons. Students will deliver presentations in triads to share information about the community organization they researched and how this organization embodies key lessons from Japanese American internment. Working in triads is supportive of all students and creates an opportunity for them to harness the strengths of each individual group member.

- ELLs may find it challenging to give an oral presentation. One reason for this may be a concern that they may say something incorrectly. Ensure that all students understand that they must practice the habits of character of empathy, compassion, and respect when listening to their peers’ presentations. Explain that some students might need extra care and encouragement with giving presentations.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.A.1, 8.I.A.2, 8.I.A.3, and 8.I.A.4.

Assessment Guidance

- The End of Unit 3 Assessment is included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback to students on this assessment, use the provided Assessment checklist for each student. Prioritize listening in on students with less data regarding their speaking and listening skills.

- Display a schedule that identifies when students are presenting. See the In Advance section for important additional information.

- Utilize a timer to keep presentations on track and no longer than 5 minutes.

- Encourage students to give one another a word of congratulations or a nonverbal cue of congratulations after viewing one another’s presentations.

- If possible, video record students’ presentations and watch the videos with students afterward to evaluate their volume, eye contact, intonation, and clarity of responses to the presentation prompts.

Down the Road

- The next lesson is the final lesson of this module. Students participate in the Activist Assembly to bring the module and the year to a close.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare the End of Unit 3 Assessment (see Assessment Overview and Resources).

- Decide if students will also complete the optional peer assessment and for how many of their peers. This is provided as an option if students would benefit from having an additional task while listening to ensure accountability while also providing their peers with feedback on their presentation skills.

- Create and post the presentation order and the listener responsibilities based on the decisions above.

- Plan to strategically assign people to Activist Assembly groups for the performance task in the following lesson. Groups should consist of two triads and several community members. If representatives from the researched organizations are able to attend the assembly, they should be assigned to the same group as the students who researched about their organization.

- Consider whether to designate or allow students to choose one of the following roles for the Activist Assembly for the performance task. The roles will be determined in Closing and Assessment B of this lesson.

- Several greeters to greet and direct community members to their assembly groups

- Several emcees to formally welcome the community members and launch the Activist Assembly

- One to two facilitators in each assembly group to lead discussions by asking questions and encouraging all members to participate

- One to two recorders in each assembly group to record notes from their activist group discussions

- Participants (remaining group members) to participate in the activist group discussions and offer ideas to add to the Activist anchor chart

- Review the student tasks and example answers to get familiar with what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Prepare copies of handouts for students, including the entrance ticket (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time A: Use a recording device to capture all students presenting. Recordings can then be accessed later by the students for self-assessment and reflection and/or for summative assessment after the lesson ends.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **3**, **Lessons** **10** – **11**. Students will also need their **Mid** - **Unit** **3** **Assessment** **with** **feedback**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. End of Unit 3 Assessment: Activist Organization Presentation (70 minutes)

- Focus students on the **Presentation** **checklist**. Invite students to Turn and Talk to an elbow partner and share one criterion they want to focus on during their presentation today and why.

- Invite students to meet with their triad and take out their **Performance** **Task**: **Activist** **Organization** **note** - **catcher** and **visual** **display**.

- Distribute the **End** **of** **Unit** **3** **Assessment**: **Activist** **Organization** **Presentation**. Review the directions. Remind students they have planned and rehearsed and are ready to present. Clarify any questions students may have. If applicable, distribute the optional **Peer** **Assessment**: **Activist** **Organization** **Presentation**, and post the peer presentation assignments.

- Explain the procedures and expectations both when the students are presenters and when they are audience members. Remind students to check the **Work** **to** **Become** **Ethical** **People** **anchor** **chart** before they listen to their peers’ presentations, focusing on the characteristics of respect and empathy.

- Begin the presentations, using a **device** **to** **record** **presentations** to support assessing students’ skills. Use the **End** **of** **Unit** **3** **Assessment**: **Activist** **Organization** **Presentation** **Scoring** (**for** **teacher** **reference**) and the **Grade** **8** **Speaking** **and** **Listening** **checklists** to assess presentations.

- After the allotted time for presentations has expired, invite audience members to join in a show of appreciation for all presenters. Invite students to join in a gesture of appreciation for all the audience members.

For Lighter Support

- As students carry out final preparation for their presentations, encourage those who need lighter support to vary the way that they present information. Invite students to select one challenge to focus on during their presentation. Some challenges are suggested below:

- Begin your presentation with a rhetorical question.

- Incorporate the sentence frame: “By learning more about \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \[name of community organization\], I \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.”

- Ask the audience a *wh* - or *how* question using appropriate intonation.

For Heavier Support

- Develop a note-catcher that students can use to record key information from their peers’ presentations as they listen. This can include sentence frames like the following:

- “This group researched \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, a community organization that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.”

- “This organization is applying lessons from Japanese American internment by \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.”

- “People can get involved with this organization by\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.”

- “One question I have for the presenters is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.”

- This will not only help ELLs to enrich their learning during the presentations, but will also build active listening skills.

Closing and Assessment

A. Reflection (5 minutes)

- Refocus whole group. Focus students on the Presentation checklist. Invite students to Turn and Talk to an elbow partner and share if they were successful at the one criterion they wanted to focus on during their presentation today. Remind students to report at least one piece of evidence that supports their evaluation.

- Give students specific, positive feedback on their presentations (e.g., “I heard a lot of you speaking at an appropriate pace and volume to be clearly understood”).

Closing and Assessment

B. Prepare for Activist Assembly (10 minutes)

- Refocus whole group. Either allow students to choose, or assign, the roles for the Activist Assembly in Lesson 12. (See Teaching Notes for suggestions on roles and responsibilities.)

- Allow students to meet with their classmates who share the same role and plan the following:

<!-- -->

- Greeters plan what they can say to community members as they arrive and how they will direct them to their assigned assembly group locations.

- Emcees plan how they will formally welcome the community members and launch the Activist Assembly, including briefly explaining their learning from the module, especially the lessons from Japanese American internment that they identified and discussed.

- Facilitators plan the questions and prompts they will use to encourage all members of their assembly group to participate.

- Recorders plan and set up their chart paper to best record notes from the discussion in an anchor chart.

- Participants (remaining students) plan what they will say and how they will use their visual in their assembly group discussion.

<!-- -->

- Circulate as students plan to guide them to complete their individual tasks, reminding students to take notes in order to prepare for their role.

- Consider assigning each emcee a topic to discuss in order to launch the Activist Assembly:

- Welcome the participants and share what lessons from internment students learned.

- Share what research the class has done (including as applicable sharing about the articles read at the beginning of this unit).

- Share what the purpose of today’s discussion is (to discuss how the lessons from internment are being applied in the community and how people can get involved in this work).

- Assist the facilitators to generate questions and prompts to guide discussion in addition to the guiding question (What are the most effective and meaningful ways to apply lessons from internment in our own community?). Examples are listed below:

<!-- -->

- What lesson from internment does this organization embody? How does it embody this lesson?

- Can you explain the work of the organization more? Can you explain the lesson from internment more?

- Why does this organization’s work seem so important?

- What seem to be the biggest challenges for this organization’s work?

- What makes you think that?

- What ideas do others have about this?

- Can you explain your visual? How does it represent the work of the organization?

- How can people get involved in the work of this organization?

<!-- -->

- Distribute a copy of the **Performance** **Task**: **Model** **Activist** **anchor** **chart** to each recorder. Review the different lessons from internment in each table. Explain that students should use this same structure for their assembly group anchor charts, but they may have identified different lessons from internment embodied by their researched organization. Their charts should reflect the lesson or lessons from internment that their researched organization embodies. To further support recorders in setting up their anchor charts, display the **Performance** **Task**: **Model** **Activist** **anchor** **chart** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) so they can see sample notes.

- Inform students that they will set up the room as a class at the start of the next lesson.

Homework

A. Prepare for Activist Assembly

- Students practice what they might say in their role as greeter, emcee, facilitator, or group participant during the Activist Assembly and make final preparations as needed.
