Performance Task: Activist  
Assembly Directions

W.8.8, W.8.10, SL.8.1, SL.8.5, SL.8.6

**Name:** **Date:**

There is no way to undo the past wrongs of Japanese American internment. But the lessons learned from this dark time in history can be applied to the world around us today. In preparation for this performance task, you will work in triads to identify local organizations who, in their own ways, embody and apply some of the lessons from internment. Through research and interviews, you will learn about the ways in which your selected organization contributes to a better world through activism and community engagement. Using your organization’s work as guidance and inspiration, for the performance task you will participate in an Activist Assembly, collaborating with your peers and community members to develop ideas and suggestions for how people in your own community can get involved and apply lessons from internment to contribute to a better world. These suggestions will be shared, refined, and compiled on an Activist anchor chart during the Activist Assembly.

**The Activist’s Action Steps**

1.  Research an Organization (in triads):

2.  Identify three possible organizations in your community whose work connects to at least one of the lessons of Japanese American internment.

3.  Practice your phone and interview skills, and prepare engaging interview questions.

4.  Reach out to your selected organization to conduct the interview, taking careful notes on the interviewee’s responses. If you are not able to make contact with your first-choice organization, try your second or third pick. If using phones is not permitted or practical, email your researched organizations.

- Question 1: Confirm your understanding of the organization’s work.

- Questions 2–4: Connect the organization’s work to lessons of internment.

- Question 5: Ask how people in the community can get involved with the organization and help.

- Question 6: See if it is okay to reach out with clarification or follow-up questions.

5.  Synthesize your research and interview notes into the note-catcher.

6.  Prepare an engaging visual display (an image) that illustrates the work of your organization and its connection to the community.

7.  Plan your presentation about your organization to share your visual and information about the following questions:

- What is the organization, and what kind of work does it do?

- How does the organization’s work connect to lessons from internment?

- How can people get involved with this organization, and how can they carry out similar work in their own lives for their own communities?

8.  Complete End of Unit 3 Assessment Presentation in triads.

9.  Participate in the Activist Assembly:

10. With your triad from the End of Unit 3 Assessment, join in a discussion group with another triad that researched a different organization (and visiting community members, family, and representatives from organizations) to discuss the guiding question: what are the most effective and meaningful ways to apply lessons from internment in our own community?

- Discuss and record ways in which community organizations are applying lessons from internment in the Activist anchor chart:

  – Use Conversation Cues to invite, clarify, and build upon the ideas of others in your focus groups.

  – Refer to the work of your researched organizations for examples.

  – Share the visual aids from your End of Unit 3 Assessment presentations, as needed.

- Brainstorm and record ways in which you can apply lessons from internment in your own daily life, at you school, or in your community in the right-hand column of the Activist anchor chart:

  – Use Conversation Cues to invite, clarify, and build upon the ideas of others in your focus groups.

  – Where applicable, support your ideas with examples from your research.

11. Reassemble as a whole class, and participate in a Chalk Talk to share the ways your group identified to apply lessons from Japanese American internment.
