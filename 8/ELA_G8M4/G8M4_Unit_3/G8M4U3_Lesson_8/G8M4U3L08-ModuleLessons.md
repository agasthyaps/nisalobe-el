Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- SL.8.6 – Work Time A: Students conduct phone interviews, adapting their speech to the context of a formal interview.

- SL.8.5 – Closing and Assessment A: Students design visual displays to be used in their end of unit assessment presentations. These visual displays are intended to illustrate and clarify their organization’s work and add interest to their presentations.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners by demonstrating initiative and perseverance. Students call their selected organizations and initiate an interview. If their first-choice organization does not answer, they call their second- and third-choice organizations.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- For an added challenge, and as time allows, consider encouraging students to conduct multiple interviews with more than one of the organizations they researched. Students can synthesize information about multiple organizations, drawing more overarching conclusions about the most effective and meaningful ways to apply lessons from internment in their own communities.

- To reinforce work with W.8.8, and to help students complete their Performance Task: Activist Organization note-catchers, adapt the “Gather Information: Paraphrase and Quote” Research Mini Lesson from Module 2 to help students paraphrase and quote the spoken responses of their interviewees.

- To further support students’ work with SL.8.5, invite triads to research simple infographics or graphic designs associated with organizations or companies they are familiar with. Students can analyze how the visuals add interest or help clarify what the organizations do.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students have prepared for their activist organization interviews. They have conducted research to learn more about three organizations in their communities and they have prepared a phone script and questions to guide their interviews. In this lesson, students interview a representative from one of the organizations and complete their Performance Task: Activist Organization note-catchers.

Support All Students

- If phones are not available or practical, students should have contacted their three organizations via email in the previous lesson. If they have received responses, they can use those responses to complete their Performance Task: Activist Organization note-catchers and then create their visual. If they have not received email responses, they can send follow-up emails and conduct additional online research to complete the note-catcher as much as they are able.

- During the interviews of Work Time A, students take turns speaking on the phone, as well as listening carefully and taking notes. Consider ways to best set up students for success, especially ELLs, for whom this process may be especially challenging. For example, before students make their calls, briefly review simple questions that students can use to ask for clarification (e.g., “So what you’re saying is \_\_\_\_\_?” “I didn’t quite catch that. Can you say that again please?”). ▲

- In Work Time A, with their interviewee’s permission, triads can record their interviews using a recording device that is not being used for the interview call. Students can replay the interview to review the information the interviewee provided and refine their notes accordingly. Ensure that students know how to ask for permission to record the call. ▲

- To accommodate diverse and varying artistic interests and abilities, allow triads flexibility in the kind of visual display they develop. For example, students can use computer programs to produce digital images, they can draw their visuals by hand, or they can create collages using construction paper and printed images.

- To support ELLs, this lesson supports students in carrying out interviews with local community organizations and in preparing their visual aids for the End of Unit 3 Assessment presentations. Students will use carefully planned and rehearsed phone scripts and interview questions to conduct their interviews in supportive triads. Students are given a choice in how to design a visual aid that represents how the organization they researched is applying lessons from Japanese American internment today. In the Closing and Assessment of the lesson, students exchange feedback on their visuals to provide supportive and constructive steps and stars to help one another refine their work.

- ELLs may find it challenging to confidently conduct phone interviews with representatives from community organizations. Prioritize time for students to review their scripts and questions, and encourage oral rehearsal. Students may also find it difficult to design a visual aid for their presentations. Encourage triads to share ideas, and reassure students that there is no one right way to capture the work of their organization visually.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.A.1, 8.I.A.2, 8.I.A.3, and 8.I.A.4.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Performance Task: Activist Organization note-catchers to ensure that students are producing clear and meaningful answers to the questions in the second table.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will use their completed Performance Task: Activist Organization note-catchers to prepare and practice their end of unit assessment presentations, which will take place during Lessons 10–11. Students will also complete the visual displays that they will integrate into their presentations.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Determine where triads should sit as they make their phone calls. There should be enough space between each group to allow students to comfortably hear their interviewees over speakerphone.

- Locate quiet places (e.g., in the hall or in nearby rooms) where triads can make their phone calls. Arrange to have these places available to students during the lesson.

- If students are using computers to make phone calls (i.e., through Skype or another calling program), make sure that these computers are on, with working speakers and the ability to make and record calls.

- Determine what triads will use to create their visual displays. Consider giving students as many options as possible by giving them access to both physical art supplies (e.g., pens, paper, markers, colored construction paper) and digital art supplies (e.g., computer art programs).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time A: Prepare devices with which students can make a phone call (e.g., a personal cell phone with speakerphone, an online calling program).

- Closing and Assessment A: Prepare devices with which students can design and create their visual displays.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Prepare to Conduct Interview (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons. Tell students that the habits of character to focus on in this lesson are initiative and perseverance. If productive, invite students to discuss what initiative and perseverance might look like in the context of a phone interview with their selected organizations. Refer to the **Work** **to** **Become** **Effective** **Learners** **anchor** **chart** as needed.

- Direct students’ attention back to the **Performance** **Task** **anchor** **chart**. Ask them to retrieve their **Performance** **Task**: **Activist** **Assembly** **directions** and their **Lessons** **from** **Internment** **note** - **catcher**.

- Remind students that, in this lesson, they will be conducting a phone interview with an activist organization in the community. Invite students to retrieve their **Performance** **Task**: **Activist** **Organization** **Interview** **Preparation** from the previous lesson. Give students a few moments to sit with their triads and review their notes and interview questions. Students should also access their **phone** **or** **other** **device** **for** **making** **calls**. If using one of their own cell phones, students should determine which group member’s phone will be used to make the call; other phones should remain away and out of sight. The phone should have a speakerphone feature, so that students can hear and take notes on all of the interviewee’s responses. Also, remind students to ask the interviewee if they can record the call, as they will want to listen to the call a few times in order to take additional notes if possible. See **Lessons** **from** **Internment** **note** - **catcher** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) and **Performance** **Task**: **Activist** **Organization** **Interview** **Preparation** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

Work Time

A. Conduct Activist Organization Interview and Synthesize Notes – SL.8.6 (25 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can practice adapting my speech to conduct a phone interview, focusing on speaking clearly and using academic language.”

- Release triads to make calls and conduct interviews. Triads should start by calling their first-choice organization. If there is no answer, they should move on to their second or third choices.

- Monitor students as they conduct interviews, listening quietly and noting groups that may need extra support.

- After triads finish their interviews, they should work to complete the second table on their **Performance** **Task**: **Activist** **Organization** **note** - **catchers**, using their **Performance** **Task**: **Model** **Activist** **Organization** **note** - **catchers** for reference as needed. Remind students that this table will inform their work in their end of unit assessment presentations and in the Activist Assembly. Responses should be clear, cogent, and relevant.

- As students work to complete the note-catcher, they should discuss the call and, if they have recorded it, relisten to it as well. If necessary, prompt students to synthesize the call by directing them to discuss the questions on their note-catcher.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Closing and Assessment

A. Create Visual Display – SL.8.5 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can create a visual display to clarify information about my researched organization, which will be integrated into my presentation.”

- Invite students—still sitting with their triads—to retrieve their Performance Task: Activist Assembly directions and locate the next step in the Activist’s Action Steps section: Prepare an engaging visual display that illustrates the work of your organization and its connection to the community.

- Think-Triad-Share:

“What makes a visual display engaging?” (Responses will vary, but may include: thoughtful design; colorful images; minimal and clearly written text.)

“How can visual displays help clarify the work of an organization?” (Responses will vary, but may include: visual displays can show the connections across different people or departments in an organization; visual displays can make it clear where resources go and how; visual displays can illustrate precisely who is benefitted by the work of the organization.)

“What kind of visual display would best help clarify and illustrate the work of the organization you interviewed? What might it look like?” (Responses will vary. Sample response: The organization we interviewed helps refugees in the community connect to the resources they need to be successful. A visual display with colorful bubbles that name the main resources refugees can access, along with arrows that show how resources are shared, could help illustrate this.)

- Distribute **materials** **and** / **or** **devices** **for** **developing** **a** **visual** **display**, and release triads to begin developing their visual displays. Tell students that, although they will have time in the next lesson to complete their visual displays, they should plan to get as much done as possible today. The visual displays can be simple, but they should be engaging and useful. Remind students to return to both their notes and the organization’s website as they create the visual.

- Circulate around the room and monitor triads’ progress as they work. As needed, help triads move from discussing the concepts of their visual displays to actually creating them to ensure that students are moving at an appropriate pace.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target and on the habits of character focus in this lesson, initiative and perseverance, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- During Closing and Assessment A, provide descriptions of examples of media or actual sample graphics that would be both relevant and irrelevant to the organization from the Performance Task: Model Activist Organization note-catcher. To deepen students’ thinking, present samples without categorization, and ask students to identify those that would be appropriate for the task.

- To prepare students for the End of Unit 3 Assessment and the performance task, circulate around the classroom as students develop their visuals, and invite them to practice annotating the visual aloud, describing and explaining it like they will during assessment presentations and during the Activist Assembly. Encourage students who need lighter support to notice patterns in their description of the visual and transform these patterns into sentence frames, whose structures can be replicated by students who need heavier support during their own presentations.

For Heavier Support

- If students struggle to generate ideas for their visual aid in Closing and Assessment A, provide additional discussion questions to help them frame their thinking:

- What are three key things you have learned about your organization?

- Why is their work important? Why does it matter to your community?

- What do you most want others to know about the work the organization is doing?

Homework

A. Activist Organization Note-Catcher

- As needed, triads finish synthesizing their research and interview notes on their Performance Task: Activist Organization note-catchers.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent** **reading** **journal**.
