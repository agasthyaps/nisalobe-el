Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.8.1 – Opening A: In an opening activity, students share the evidence they gathered for homework from the article “Psychological Effects of Camp,” *Farewell to Manzanar*, and any other texts to support their analysis of the lessons from internment.

- RI.8.2 – Work Time A: Students read and analyze the development of central ideas over the course of the article “Japanese Internment Camp Survivors Protest Ft. Sill Migrant Detention Center.”

- RI.8.4 – Work Time A: Students determine the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary in the article “Japanese Internment Camp Survivors Protest Ft. Sill Migrant Detention Center.”

- L.8.4 – Work Time A: Students use strategies to determine the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary in the article “Japanese Internment Camp Survivors Protest Ft. Sill Migrant Detention Center.”

- SL.8.1 – Closing and Assessment A: Students engage in a collaborative discussion about how the article “Japanese Internment Camp Survivors Protest Ft. Sill Migrant Detention Center” conveys lessons from internment. During the discussion, students draw on their notes, follow agreed-upon rules, ask and answer relevant questions, and acknowledge new information.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners by collaborating with peers to read and analyze a complex text as well as in a collaborative discussion.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- The RI.2 standard for Grades 9 and 10 asks students to determine two or more central ideas of a text and analyze their development, including how they build on one another to provide a complex analysis. Ask students to determine two or more central ideas from the article “Japanese Internment Camp Survivors Protest Ft. Sill Migrant Detention Center” and analyze how they build on one another. Students can form pairs or small groups to discuss their analysis of the article.

- Release more responsibility more quickly to students as they comprehend the tasks or concepts:

- Allow those students who are able to read and analyze the complex article independently to do so, acting as a thought-partner with their peers once they finish reading and analyzing the article.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students have focused on reading and analyzing central ideas in the article “Psychological Effects of Camp.” In this lesson, students will continue this work with more independence by reading a new article and analyzing it for central ideas as well as for how it conveys lessons from internment.

Support All Students

- At this point, students should be reading the text independently. However, if some or all students need more support, read several paragraphs aloud and then release students to read independently, in pairs, or in small groups.

- The subject matter in this excerpt includes references to imprisonment of children in inhumane conditions. Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this chapter that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually. To support students in processing this content, ask: “What habit of character did you use as you read and discussed this article?” Students may need to draw on perseverance, empathy, and compassion as they read and discuss this content, being sensitive to their own and others’ reactions to the information presented.

- Draw together in a group those students who are not ready to read the article independently to guide them to read, determine vocabulary, identify gist, and analyze central ideas. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson uses a text to introduce students to modern activism and how survivors of Japanese American internment are applying lessons from Japanese American internment. This work builds off the reading students have done in Lessons 1, 2, and 3 of this unit, in which they began to generate key takeaways and enduring lessons from Japanese American internment The lesson also includes further practice with speaking and listening skills during the Closing and Assessment of the lesson, in which students participate in a collaborative discussion that follows a similar format to the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment in the next lesson.

- ELLs may find it challenging to comprehend the article and apply their understanding to the discussion. ELLs may also find it difficult to understand and absorb information that their classmates share during the exchange. Be prepared to provide additional support to struggling groups or add extra time, if possible. Focusing on vocabulary in advance of the activity can also help ELLs read more efficiently and comprehend more of the text. Likewise, spending additional time as a class on reviewing what students have recorded on their Lessons from Internment note-catchers will help students to confidently enter the Closing and Assessment discussion.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.A.1, 8.I.A.3, 8.I.A.4, 8.I.B.6, 8.I.B.8, 8.II.A.1, and 8.II.A.2.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Lessons from Internment note-catchers to ensure students understand how to determine central ideas and trace their development across the text in an objective summary.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will complete their mid-unit assessment, a collaborative discussion about the lessons from internment, drawing on the evidence they gathered from the articles read over the course of the unit and from *Farewell to Manzanar*. Students also draw on the speaking and listening skills they have practice throughout the module.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Strategically group students into pairs for the partner reading and analysis in Work Time A and into small groups for the collaborative discussion of Closing and Assessment A. Be mindful of students’ needs when selecting students to work together. For example, consider pairing students by similar content knowledge, home language, or reading level so that they can support one another without one student dominating over another. ▲

- For Closing and Assessment A, each student is encouraged to ask and answer at least one question and make one statement to acknowledge others’ ideas or justify or qualify their own ideas. If necessary, consider giving each student three objects that they have to place in a communal container each time they participate in the discussion. If using this support, gather the following materials:

- Objects (like spoons, buttons, or paper clips; three per student)

- Container to hold the objects (one per discussion group)

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time A: For students who will benefit from hearing the texts read aloud multiple times, use a text-to-speech tool such as http://eled.org/0103. Note that to use a web-based text-to-speech tool, an online doc will need to be created—for example, http://eled.org/0158, containing the text. ▲

- Work Times A and B: Convert the Lessons from Internment note-catcher into an online format and invite students to complete them digitally—for example, http://eled.org/0158.

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous modules to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.8.1 (5 minutes)

- Ask students to retrieve their **Lessons** **from** **Internment** **note** - **catchers** and Turn and Talk to share the evidence they recorded for homework in their note-catchers from the article “ **Psychological** **Effects** **of** **Camp**,” ***Farewell to Manzanar***, and any other texts. Use **equity** **sticks** to ask students to share their responses. Consult the **Lessons** **from** **Internment** **note** - **catcher** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**). Students should add evidence to their note-catchers based on this sharing.

- Remind students that they will use this note-catcher throughout the first half of Unit 3 to gather evidence for a collaborative discussion in their mid-unit assessment on lessons from internment.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read and Analyze “Japanese Internment Camp Survivors Protest Ft. Sill Migrant Detention Center” – RI.8.2 (30 minutes)

- Review the learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can determine the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary in the article ‘Japanese Internment Camp Survivors Protest Ft. Sill Migrant Detention Center.’”

“I can determine a central idea and analyze its development over the course of the article ‘Japanese Internment Camp Survivors Protest Ft. Sill Migrant Detention Center.’”

- Display and distribute the article **Text**: “ **Japanese** **Internment** **Camp** **Survivors** **Protest** **Ft**. **Sill** **Migrant** **Detention** **Center**.” Move students into strategic partnerships, or for those students who are ready, encourage them to read independently. Inform students that they will read the article, annotate it, use strategies to determine unfamiliar vocabulary, and jot down a gist in the boxes at the end of important paragraphs. Point out the designated paragraphs on the article.

- Once students have finished reading the article, refocus the class, and use equity sticks to review the gist of each paragraph (or groups of paragraphs) and any unfamiliar vocabulary.

- Gists of “Japanese Internment Camp Survivors Protest Ft. Sill Migrant Detention Center”:

- Paragraphs 1–4: Japanese Americans who were imprisoned in WWII are protesting the detention of migrant children; uniformed military police shouted at the protesters to get out; protesters refused to leave until police let them speak; protesters are protesting at Ft. Sill because some of them were interned there or at other camps where migrant children are being detained.

- Paragraphs 14–18: Ikeda and Tomita, former incarcerees, believe they have to stand up for the migrant children.

- Paragraphs 19–26: Some Holocaust survivors and Jewish advocates agree that the detention centers and internment camps are concentration camps because “people are imprisoned not because of any crime they have committed, but simply because of who they are.”

- Paragraphs 27–31: The *Japanese American National Museum* sent Ishizuka (senior curator and descendent of internees and men who fought in WWII) to protest at Ft. Sill because she and the museum believe it is their duty as internees to protest other US concentration camps like the migrant children detention centers.

- With students’ support, record the meanings of *origami* (the Japanese art or technique of folding paper into pleasing figures), *solidarity* (a feeling or condition of unity based on common goals, interests, and sympathies among a group’s members), *influx* (a continuous coming in of things or people), *allies* (people who are united for a particular purpose), *vulnerable* (able to be hurt or injured), and *travesty* (something so grotesque or inferior as to seem a parody; a terrible comparison) on the **academic word** **wall** and **domain** - **specific** **word** **wall**, with translations in students’ home languages. Write synonyms or sketch a visual above the words to scaffold students’ understanding. Invite students to record these words in their **vocabulary** **logs**.

- Have students retrieve their Lessons from Internment note-catchers. Allow students a few minutes to work with their partner to record in any applicable boxes evidence of lessons from internment from the article “Japanese Internment Camp Survivors Protest Ft. Sill Migrant Detention Center.” Consult the Lessons from Internment note-catcher (example for teacher reference).

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- After Work Time A, invite students to participate in a Mini Language Dive in small groups to explore a central idea from an article about what Japanese American internment camp survivors are doing to protest a modern-day detention center. The sentence also helps students to consider how and why the writer uses an infinitive phrase to convey intention and quotation marks to present information.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time A, for students who require heavy support, provide the gist statement for each section on sticky notes, and have students match each one to a chunk of the article. To release support slightly, allow students to generate gist statements first and then check their understanding against the gists on sticky notes.

Closing and Assessment

A. Collaborative Discussion – SL.8.1 (10 minutes)

- Display the **Discussion** **Norms** **anchor** **chart**, and ask volunteers to review the Conversation Cues they can use to ask and answer relevant questions as well as acknowledge new information and qualify or justify their own views. Add any new sentence frames to the Discussion Norms anchor chart.

- Inform students that they will now engage in a collaborative discussion about the lessons from internment that they learned about in the article “Japanese Internment Camp Survivors Protest Ft. Sill Migrant Detention Center.” They should draw on their notes in their Lessons from Internment note-catcher as well as the article. Encourage each student to ask and answer at least one question and make one statement to acknowledge others’ ideas or justify or qualify their own ideas.

- Move students into strategic small groups, so each student has time to speak several times. As appropriate, consider giving each student three **objects** (like spoons, buttons, or paper clips) that they have to place in a communal **container** each time they participate in the discussion.

- Remind students that in this discussion they should draw on the evidence they have added to their Lessons from Internment note-catchers over the course of several lessons. They will add more evidence from the article to their note-catchers for homework.

- Begin the discussion(s) with the following prompt, but remind students that they will continue the discussion by asking and answering their own questions:

“What lessons from internment are conveyed in the article ‘Japanese Internment Camp Survivors Protest Ft. Sill Migrant Detention Center’? How are they conveyed? How does language like ‘concentration camps’ affect the discussion about these issues and lessons?” (For possible responses, consult the Lessons from Internment note-catcher \[example for teacher reference\].)

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- Before students begin the discussion in Closing and Assessment A, have them work in a small group or as a class to make a bulleted list of talking points they wish to contribute to the exchange. This will help students to organize their thinking before participating in the discussion.

For Heavier Support

- During the collaborative discussion, have a group of proficient students model a small-group exchange. Invite the students observing the exchange to take notes on the ideas their peers exchange and the strategies they use to communicate them. Then, have all students carry out small-group discussions, guided by the model discussion. For the heaviest support, encourage ELLs to engage in discussion in home languages first, to process information before discussing the article in English.

Homework

A. Add Evidence to Lessons from Internment Note-Catcher

- Students add evidence from the article “Japanese Internment Camp Survivors Protest Ft. Sill Migrant Detention Center” to their Lessons from Internment note-catchers.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent** **reading** **journal**.
