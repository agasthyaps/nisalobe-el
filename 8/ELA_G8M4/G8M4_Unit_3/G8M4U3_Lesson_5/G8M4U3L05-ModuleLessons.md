Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Work Time A: Students complete the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment. Students synthesize and reflect on their learning during the module by engaging in a QuickWrite and participating in a collaborative discussion centered on the following questions: What overarching lessons can be learned from Japanese American internment? How have these lessons been embodied in the redress movement? The focus of this assessment is on posing and responding to questions from others during collaborative discussion as well on qualifying or revising views in light of others’ discussion contributions (SL.8.1c, SL.8.1d).

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become ethical people by showing respect and empathy as they reflect on the lessons of Japanese American internment and working to become effective learners by collaborating as they work with peers and participate in a discussion.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Encourage students to express what they have learned from their independent research reading task using multimodalities. Students could create a collage, podcast, poem, or game to synthesize their learning.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students have engaged with additional texts about redress and the internment experience to add additional perspectives to their understanding of the module topic. In this lesson, students synthesize their understanding and participate in the second assessed collaborative discussion. The focus of this assessment is on posing and responding to questions from others during collaborative discussion as well on qualifying or revising views in light of others’ discussion contributions.

Support All Students

- If the class size is too large to facilitate a manageable discussion, consider adding more discussion time and using the Fishbowl protocol. Alternatively, the class could be divided into two groups and conduct their discussions simultaneously while being recorded. Whichever method is used, recording the discussion is recommended to be able to better assess students’ contributions.

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment.

- Prior to the assessment, build in time for students to review what they have learned about lessons from Japanese American internment orally in pairs or small groups. This will help students to organize their thinking before carrying out the QuickWrite independently. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson uses a structured collaborative text-based discussion format for the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment. Students will discuss the lessons from Japanese American internment they have considered in previous lessons, providing evidence from *Farewell to Manzanar* and other informational texts to support their responses. Students will also have the opportunity to apply oral skills developed during practice collaborative discussions in lessons leading up to this assessment.

- ELLs may find it challenging to balance the contextual and linguistic demands of the collaborative discussion. For some students, even though they have been practicing their speaking in groups in lessons leading up to this one, a whole-group discussion may feel intimidating. Encourage students to focus on a few key points about lessons from Japanese American internment and the redress movement that they know well and to utilize anchor charts and other resources to aid them in navigating the linguistic demands of the discussion.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.A.1, 8.I.A.3, and 8.I.A.4.

Assessment Guidance

- The Mid-Unit 3 Assessment is included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback to students on this assessment, use the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment Recording Sheet for assessing each student’s progress toward SL.8.1c andSL.8.1d.

- Circulate and monitor during the independent research reading share to help students make connections between their independent reading and their learning about the module topic.

Down the Road

- In the following lesson, students begin work on the performance task.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **3**, **Lesson** **5**. Students will also need their **Module** **4** **End** **of** **Unit** **2** **Assessment** **with** **feedback**.

- Once all students are ready, invite them to share their stars and steps with a partner. Remind students that everyone is working toward individual goals and that learning is about continued growth and development.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Mid-Unit 3 Assessment: Collaborative Discussion: Internment and Redress – SL.8.1 (25 minutes)

- Direct students to the **Discussion** **Norms** **anchor** **chart**, specifically on the cues and responses. Remind students that a discussion is not just about saying what we want to say. Effective participation is about listening to others and asking and answering questions. Questions help us to be completely clear about what others are saying and to clarify our own points. Remind students that it’s important they build off one another’s ideas and ask questions of their peers to deepen their understanding throughout the discussion.

- Remind students that focus standards for this discussion are the following:

- “SL.8.1c: Pose questions that connect the ideas of several speakers and respond to others’ questions and comments with relevant evidence, observations, and ideas.”

- “SL.8.1d: Acknowledge new information expressed by others, and, when warranted, qualify or justify their own views in light of the evidence presented.”

- Explain to students that while the focus of the assessment is on asking and answering questions as well as acknowledging new information and qualifying or justifying one’s ideas, students will have to use evidence to support their ideas and follow the agreed-upon rules for a collaborative discussion.

- Distribute and display **Mid** - **Unit** **3** **Assessment**: **Collaborative** **Discussion**: **Internment** **and** **Redress**.

- Read aloud the directions for the assessment as students read silently to follow along. Ensure all students understand the assessment directions. Answer their questions, refraining from supplying answers to the assessment questions themselves.

- Ask students to retrieve their **Lessons** **from** **Internment** **note** - **catchers** and their copies of the text ***Farewell to Manzanar*** to begin composing their QuickWrite. Refer to the **Mid** - **Unit** **3** **Assessment**: **Collaborative** **Discussion**: **Internment** **and** **Redress** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- After 5 minutes have passed, refocus students whole group.

- Focus students on the **Work** **to** **Become** **Ethical** **People** **anchor** **chart** and the **Work** **to** **Become** **Effective** **Learners** **anchor** **chart**. Remind students that it is not easy for everyone to participate in a discussion. Uplift the habits of respect, compassion, and empathy in preparation for the discussion.

- Begin the discussion, using the guiding questions. Use the **Mid** - **Unit** **3** **Assessment** **Recording** **Sheet** to assess students as they participate for SL.8.1.

“What overarching lessons can be learned from Japanese American internment?” (Responses will vary, but may include:

- It is wrong to view entire populations as homogeneous.

- Upholding the rights of other human beings is critical work.

- In times of great fear, people and government sometimes make decisions that hurt innocent people.

- In times of terrible struggle, people can draw strength from their identities and communities.)

“How have these lessons been embodied in the redress movement?” (Responses will vary, but may include:

- It is wrong to view entire populations as homogeneous.

- Upholding the rights of other human beings is critical work.)

- Close discussion by inviting students to ask lingering questions to the group and/or reflect on their responses to this period in history.

For Lighter Support

- Before Work Time A, review the Conversation Cues students have been using while practicing speaking skills. Work as a class to generate a list of sentence starters based on these, and other phrases, that students can refer to during the text-based discussion.

For Heavier Support

- In advance of the assessment, prepare individual sticky notes for students that include a list of sentence starters based on Conversation Cues that students can refer to during the discussion when they wish to elaborate or clarify information. These might include the following:

- “So, do you mean \_\_\_\_\_?”

- “Sure. I think that \_\_\_\_\_.”

- “OK. One example is \_\_\_\_\_.”

- “No, sorry, that’s not what I mean. I mean \_\_\_\_\_.”

Closing and Assessment

A. Track Progress: Collaborative Discussion (5 Minutes)

- Give students specific positive feedback on their completion of the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment (e.g., “I was pleased to see a lot of you referring to your note-catchers to find details”).

- Distribute **Track** **Progress**: **Collaborative** **Discussion** and **Track** **Progress** **folders**. Tell students that successful learners keep track of and reflect on their own learning.

- Guide students through completing the form. Encourage students to orally paraphrase the meaning of the Track Progress criteria, self-assess, and discuss the evidence with a partner before they begin writing.

- Invite students to place the form in their Track Progress folder, and collect students’ folders.

For Lighter Support

- As with previous assessments, if students seem unsure of how to respond to the open-ended questions on the Track Progress: Collaborative Discussion handout, provide examples of statements that answer the questions about previous improvements and goals for future improvement that are directly connected to the criteria within the handout to help students create clear self-reflection and concrete, attainable personal targets such as the following:

- “I have improved at posing questions during collaborative discussions.”

- “In the future, I will improve my participation in a collaborative discussion by making more of an effort to acknowledge new information expressed by others.”

Closing and Assessment

B. Share Independent Research Reading – RL.8.10, RI.8.10 (10 minutes)

- Refer to the **Independent** **Reading** **Sample** **Plans** to guide students through a research reading share or use another routine.

- Remind students that this is the final sharing of independent research reading for the unit and that the purpose of research reading is to build their content knowledge, domain-specific vocabulary, and achievement on reading complex texts. Praise students for demonstrating integrity by keeping up with their independent research reading even though it might have been challenging.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their habit of character focus for this lesson.

Homework

A. Read and Annotate

- Students read and annotate the **Performance** **Task**: **Activist** **Assembly** **directions**, beginning to consider and discuss with their families organizations they might research.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent** **reading** **journal**.
