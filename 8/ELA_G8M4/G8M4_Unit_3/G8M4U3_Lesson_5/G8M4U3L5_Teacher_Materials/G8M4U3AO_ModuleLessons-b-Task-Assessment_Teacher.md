Mid-Unit 3 Assessment: Collaborative Discussion: Internment and Redress

SL.8.1c, SL.8.1d

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**QuickWrite**

To prepare for this discussion, QuickWrite in response to the following questions (the first is one of our module guiding questions):

- What overarching lessons can be learned from Japanese American internment?

- How have these lessons been embodied in the redress movement?

Remember to use details and examples from the unit texts to support and explain your thinking.

Responses will vary but may include the following:

- It is wrong to view entire populations as homogeneous.

- In times of great fear, people and government sometimes make decisions that hurt innocent people.

- Upholding the rights of other human beings is critical work.

- In times of terrible struggle, people can draw strength from their identities and communities.

**Collaborative Discussion**

You will participate in a collaborative discussion to discuss the above guiding questions and some additional questions as time allows.

Throughout the discussion, be sure to refer to the following materials:

- Your QuickWrite
