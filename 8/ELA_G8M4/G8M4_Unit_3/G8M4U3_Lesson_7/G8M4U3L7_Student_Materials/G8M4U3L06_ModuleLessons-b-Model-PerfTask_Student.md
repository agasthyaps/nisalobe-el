<p>Other notes and considerations: <strong>Because this organization offers so many services, it might be good to choose one area to focus on.

<td>Description of organization</td>
<td><p>What is the organization, and what work does it do in the community?</p>
<p><strong>The Refugee Assistance Committee in Tucson, Arizona, helps provide refugees in Tucson with the resources and services that they need to survive and be successful. “We help them adjust to life in America and ultimately become self-sufficient,” said Kristen Martin, volunteer coordinator. The RAC helps refugees by welcoming them to the United States and connecting them to things they need to be safe and happy, like a home, food, healthcare, and language classes.</strong></p></td>

<td><p>How does this work connect to the lessons from internment that we discussed in class?</p>
<p><strong>Upholding the rights of other human beings is critical work.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The RAC uplifts other human beings and upholds their rights by “helping them to take control of their lives again,” Martin said. The RAC helps them find jobs and healthcare. According to Martin, the RAC wants to help refugees “have safety and security in this country and make their own choices.”</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>It is wrong to view entire populations as monoliths.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The RAC supports people as individuals, rather than as members of a large homogeneous group. Every person or family who comes to the RAC for help is assigned a case manager and gets an individualized care plan. “We make sure everyone is listened to and heard,” said Martin.</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In times of terrible struggle, people can draw strength from their identities and communities.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The RAC recognizes that, in times of terrible struggle, people can draw strength from their identities and communities. One way in which they do this is through their women’s sewing group. Through this group, women have a time to come together, learn a skill, and connect with one another to create a community.</strong></p></li>

<td>Ways to get involved</td>
<td><p>How can people get involved with this organization, and how can they carry out similar work in their own lives for their own communities?</p>
<p><strong>People can call or write to their Congressional Representatives or volunteer to help at events. Companies can hire a refugee, and people can offer to have a refugee stay at their home. The website has many resources for finding volunteer opportunities.</strong></p>
<p><strong>People can also help refugees in their own communities by assisting them with filling out paperwork for citizenship.</strong></p></td>
