Close Reading Guide:  
“Psychological Effects of Camp”

RI.8.2

(For Teacher Reference)

**Purpose and Notes**

- The purpose of this close read is for students to analyze the first section of the text “Psychological Effects of Camp.” As they analyze, they will determine the meanings of key words and phrases in the text, including figurative and connotative meanings, and explore the impact of specific words and phrases on meaning and tone. In this close read, students will focus only on the first section of the article: “Negative Psychological Effects.” In the culminating task, students will explain the central idea of the text.

- Read each chunk of the section aloud, and prompt students to follow along, reading silently. From time to time, have students reread portions of the text.

- Students work in pairs for this close read. Since part of this will include rereading in pairs, students should be paired with this in mind.

- A note-catcher along with text-dependent questions provide an opportunity for students to think, talk, and write in order to analyze the text.

- Continue to use discussion protocols (e.g., Turn and Talk, cold call, and total participation techniques) to engage all students in collaborative discussion about the text.

<td>Before reading</td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Explain that students are about to read some additional information about the internment experience. The text <em>Farewell to Manzanar</em> is a memoir, written from Jeanne’s personal perspective. Now they will read a text compiled from multiple sources to add to their understanding of Japanese American internment.</p></li>
<li><p>Remind students that when they did research in Module 2, they learned a lot about the importance of using credible sources. This new text comes from a source called <em>Densho Encyclopedia</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Display the “About” page of the source. Cold-call on students to point out the various features of what makes the source credible (wide range of sources, editor and advisors with much experience, current).</p></li>
<li><p>Ask, “Why is it important to pay attention to the credibility of the source when we read texts like this?” (If we are going to use the information, it’s important to know the information is accurate.)</p></li>
<li><p>Distribute the Close Read: “Psychological Effects of Camp” note-catcher.</p></li>
<li><p>Explain that an encyclopedia like this is often very densely written with lots of information. We will read slowly, and do some rereading, so we can understand the information. We will also use the way the text has been structured to help us make sense of the information.</p></li>
<li><p>Explain that we’re about to read and zero in on the first section of this article, “Negative Psychological Effects.” Since this is just one section of the article, it will be helpful to get a good sense of the author’s purpose for this section within the entire article.</p></li>
<li><p>Read aloud to students the introduction to the article, which says,</p></li>
<li><p>“Japanese Americans experienced a range of psychological effects related to their incarceration. These effects stemmed from multiple stressors that occurred over time. Some emerged soon after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Others emerged during the incarceration itself, and still others extended decades after the war ended and the camps had closed.”</p></li>
<li><p>Ask, “What do you think the word <strong>psychological</strong> means?” (in someone’s mind, how someone feels)</p></li>
<li><p>“What does <strong>effects</strong> mean?” (the results or impact)</p></li>
<li><p>“How does this introduction help you understand the purpose of what you are about to read?” (The author is going to write about a large number of different psychological effects. This particular section will concentrate on the harmful effects.)</p></li>

<td>Read aloud from “Shock, fear” to “heritage” (first paragraph).</td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Direct students to read silently as you read aloud.</p></li>
<li><p>Use equity sticks to ask: “What is the basic gist of this first paragraph?” (Being sent to camps was very stressful in many ways.)</p></li>
<li><p>Prompt students: “With your partner, reread the section aloud.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on the context, what do you think the term <strong>unjust ethnic denigration</strong> might mean?”</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>(<strong>Unjust</strong> means unfair, and <strong>ethnic</strong> means based on the group you belong to, so <strong>denigration</strong> must mean that the Japanese Americans were being treated badly based unfairly on the group they belonged to.) Prompt students to record their responses on the note-catcher.</p></li>

<li><p>Direct students to read silently as you read aloud.</p></li>
<li><p>Cold-call, asking, “What is the basic gist of this second paragraph?” (Conditions were hard in camp, and people responded in various ways.)</p></li>
<li><p>Prompt students: “With your partner, reread the first sentence. What do you think the word <strong>dehumanizing</strong> means?” (treated without dignity, not the way a human being should be treated)</p></li>
<li><p>Remind students that just as they need to give specific evidence to support their point when they write, so do published authors.</p></li>
<li><p>Prompt students: “On your note-catcher, name some of the evidence/examples the author gives in this sentence of ‘dehumanizing conditions.’” (poor housing, food, poor medical care, inadequate education)</p></li>
<li><p>Say: “Now with your partner, reread the next two sentences from ‘feelings of helplessness’ to ‘emotion.’”</p></li>
<li><p>Ask students to Think-Pair-Share: “What <u>effects</u>, or results, of these camp conditions is the author beginning to discuss here?” (feeling helpless, like they had no control over their lives, responding with Japanese cultural pattern of <em>shikata ga nai</em>, it can’t be helped)</p></li>
<li><p>Prompt students: “Discuss with your partner: What do you think the word <strong>incarcerees</strong> means? Why do you think the author uses this word?” (Being imprisoned. The author wants to point out that these camps were really a form of prison.)</p></li>
<li><p>“Where did you hear the term <strong>shikata na gai</strong> in <em>Farewell to Manzanar</em>?” (Jeanne frequently referred to this as how her family and other families coped with life in the camps.)</p></li>
<li><p>“Notice that the next sentence begins with the word <strong>however</strong>. This is an important word to pay attention to.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>When did you use this word when you wrote your argument essay?” (We used it in the counterclaim paragraph, when we were explaining how our thinking was different from the people who disagreed with us.)</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>Prompt students: “On your note-catcher, write to answer this question: what does <strong>however</strong> tell you about the type of information the author is now going to give?” (The author will bring in some new effects of incarceration in the camps that are different from shikata na gai.)</p></li>
<li><p>“What does the rest of the sentence tell us about these effects?” (Some incarcerees were angry about the treatment in the camps.)</p></li>

<td>Read aloud from “More specific psychological effects” to “suspicion” (third paragraph).</td>

<blockquote>
<p>(The effects on the oldest generation of Japanese Americans, the Issei, who were in DOJ camps, were hard in several ways.)</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>Prompt students: “Reread the paragraph independently. Then, work with your partner to record on your note-catcher two pieces of evidence or examples of negative effects on the Issei in DOJ camps.” (Responses will vary but may include being arrested, bad conditions in the DOJ camps, no longer being community leaders, sometimes own children did not recognize them when they came back.)</p></li>

<li><p>Say: “Reread the paragraph independently. Then, work with your partner to record on your note-catcher two pieces of evidence or examples that the author gives about negative effects on the Issei in non-DOJ camps.” (Responses will vary but may include feeling all their hard work for years was worth nothing, men lost role of head of household, family life changed, women could go to work, younger men took more control.)</p></li>
<li><p>Remind students to think about <em>Farewell to Manzanar</em> and how Papa was an Issei.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “Which of these psychological effects did you notice in him?” (Responses will vary but may include all of the above.)</p></li>

Which of these psychological effects did you notice in her?” (Responses will vary but may include how hard she tried to be American after leaving the camp, how she accepted not being allowed to be a Girl Scout, and how she felt for years that something was wrong with her for being Japanese.)</p></li>
<li><p>Prompt students: “Discuss with your partner, then write on your note-catcher: why are all these effects considered psychological?” (They all have to do with how people thought of and felt about themselves and their lives.)</p></li>
