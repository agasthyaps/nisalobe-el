(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** After the close read, answer the following prompt.

The first section of the article “Psychological Effects of Camp” develops the central idea and lesson that internment of people based on the group they belong to has long-lasting harmful effects. Write a paragraph that develops this idea. (RI.8.1, RI.8.2)

In your response, be sure to include evidence from the first section of the article “Psychological Effects of Camp.”

Responses will vary, but may include: The lesson people can draw from the first section of the article “Psychological Effects of Camp” is that racist programs like internment have long-lasting harmful effects. The article shows this lesson by explaining the numerous negative psychological effects that incarcerated Japanese Americans experienced. For example, when they were forced from their homes and jobs, they at first felt “shock, fear, and worry.” Then as they experienced the “dehumanizing conditions” of the camps, they felt “helplessness” and “tensions” among each other. Issei incarcerees experienced extreme “stress” and “loneliness” in DOJ camps. They were separated from their families and falsely accused of treason. In non-DOJ camps, Issei men were no longer heads of household and community. Nisei’s experienced strong negative effects as well. Their college education and careers were interrupted by the incarceration. All these examples convey the lesson that racist programs like internment have long-lasting harmful effects.
