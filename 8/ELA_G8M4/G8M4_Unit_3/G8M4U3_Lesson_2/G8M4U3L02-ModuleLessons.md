Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- SL.8.1 – Opening A: Students engage in a collaborative discussion about how the article “Psychological Effects of Camp” conveys lessons from internment. During the discussion, students draw on their notes, follow agreed-upon rules, ask and answer relevant questions, and acknowledge new information.

- RI.8.2 – Work Time A: Students determine the central ideas of the article “Psychological Effects of Camp.”

- RI.8.2 – Closing and Assessment A: Students complete a culminating task to determine how the article “Psychological Effects of Camp” develops central ideas related to the lessons learned from internment.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners by collaborating with classmates during the close read and persevering to read a complex text.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- If possible, help students access video testimonies of Japanese American internment survivors, available on the Densho.org website (http://eled.org/0263). Students can view the testimonies and determine the central ideas as well as how they relate to the article “Psychological Effects of Camp.” They can create a table or visual to share this information with their classmates.

- The RI.2 standard for Grades 9 and 10 requires students to determine two or more central ideas of a text and analyze their development, including how they build on one another to provide a complex analysis. Ask students to determine two or more central ideas from the article “Psychological Effects of Camp” and analyze how they build on one another. Students can form pairs or small groups to discuss their analysis of the article.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students have focused on reading and analyzing central ideas in a new informational article. This work is revisited during the close read of this lesson, as students read a section of a new article and analyze its central ideas.

Support All Students

- The subject matter in this article includes references to the imprisonment and harsh treatment of people of Japanese descent as well as the psychological effects of this treatment. Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually. To support students in processing this content, ask: “What habit of character did you use as you read and discussed this excerpt?” Students may need to draw on perseverance, empathy, and compassion as they read and discuss this content, being sensitive to their own and others’ reactions to the information presented.

- Students may need additional support in processing oral questions during the close read. Allow time for students to think and/or write before sharing orally. Incorporate a mix of processing techniques after reading, including written reflections and small group and whole class discussion. ▲

- Note that there is a differentiated version of Close Reading Guide: “Psychological Effects of Camp” used in Work Time A in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Students may need additional support with recording their answers on their note-catchers. Sit those students in a group together for additional support when necessary. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson includes a supported close read activity and work with a note-catcher that will help students to generate lessons from Japanese American internment. The close read features Think-Pair-Shares that help students make sense of central ideas, supporting evidence, and vocabulary in the first section of “Psychological Effects of Internment.” Students work together to make meaning from this dense text to access key information about the negative psychological effects of Japanese American internment. This will also help students to prepare for continued reading of this article in the next lesson, in which they will work with the text more independently.

- ELLs may find it challenging to understand all of the information they encounter and analyze in the close read due to the density of the text and the sophistication of the topic. Remind students of the reading and vocabulary strategies they have developed and refined over the course of Modules 1, 2, 3, and 4, and encourage students to apply these strategies as they navigate this text.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6, 8.I.B.8, 8.II.A.1, and 8.II.A.2.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Close Read: “Psychological Effects of Camp” note-catcher as well as their Close Read: “Psychological Effects of Camp” Culminating Task to ensure students understand how to determine central ideas and trace their development across the text.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will finish reading the article “Psychological Effects of Camp,” reading and analyzing central ideas in pairs and then independently. Students will also use the Lessons from Internment note-catcher to capture their ideas about the lessons learned from this article. They will draw on these notes in the Mid-Unit 3 collaborative discussion in Lesson 5.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- A think-aloud is used in Opening A of this lesson. Rehearse the think-aloud to sound natural and reflect the actual metacognitive process in which students will engage.

- Preview Close Reading Guide: “Psychological Effects of Camp” (for teacher reference), Close Read: “Psychological Effects of Camp” note-catcher (example for teacher reference), and Close Read: “Psychological Effects of Camp” Culminating Task (example for teacher reference) to become familiar with what is required of students.

- Strategically group students into pairs for the close read of Work Time A. Be mindful of students’ needs when selecting students to work together. For example, consider pairing students by similar content knowledge, home language, or reading level so that they can support one another without one student dominating over another. ▲

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time A: For students who will benefit from hearing the texts read aloud multiple times, use a text-to-speech tool such as http://eled.org/0103. Note that to use a web-based text-to-speech tool, an online doc containing the text will need to be created. ▲

- Work Time A and Closing and Assessment A: Convert note-catchers and the culminating task into an online format such as http://eled.org/0158, and invite students to complete them digitally.

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous modules to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – SL.8.1 (10 minutes)

- Ask students to retrieve their **Homework**: **Connections** **and** **Distinctions** **across** **Texts** and the article “ **The** **Simplest** **Lesson** **of** **Internment** ” from the previous lesson. Explain that they will begin with a discussion of the connections and distinctions they noted for homework. Display the **Discussion** **Norms** **anchor** **chart**, and ask volunteers to review the Conversation Cues they can use to ask and answer relevant questions as well as acknowledge new information and qualify or justify their own views. Add any new sentence frames to the Discussion Norms anchor chart.

- Remind students that it is important to ask relevant questions:

- “Can you say more about that?”

- “Can you give an example?”

- “Can you give more details about \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?”

- “How did you come to that conclusion? What made you think that?”

- Remind students that it is important to answer relevant questions:

- “Sure. I think that \_\_\_\_\_.”

- “OK. One example is \_\_\_\_\_.”

- “If you look at \_\_\_\_\_, it says \_\_\_\_\_, which means \_\_\_\_\_.”

- “I think it’s because \_\_\_\_\_.”

- Remind students that it is important to acknowledge others’ ideas and to connect the ideas of several speakers:

- “That’s interesting. I hadn’t thought of it that way. Can you tell me more?/Do you mean \_\_\_?”

- “Good point. Can you give an example?”

- “How is your idea different from the idea \_\_\_ had about \_\_\_\_\_?”

- Remind students that it is important to qualify or justify responses:

- “When I said \_\_\_, I meant \_\_\_.”

- “I still think my idea is true because \_\_\_.”

- Inform students that they will now engage in a collaborative discussion on the following questions:

“What connections and distinctions do you see among these two new texts and?” Farewell to Manzanar(Responses may vary, but will likely include: One distinction is that these articles use different language to refer to what the authors of *Farewell to Manzanar* refer to as the internment—they call it incarceration or imprisonment; one connection is that chapter 16 of the text mentions some of the Supreme Court cases that helped to overturn order. Also, in chapter 19, the text discusses some of the redress efforts for the family.)

“What do these two texts add to your understanding of our module topic?” (Responses will vary.)

- Remind students to use the Conversation Cues to ask and answer questions as well as to acknowledge ideas and qualify or justify their own ideas. They should refer to ***Farewell to Manzanar*** as needed. Consult **Homework**: **Connections** **and** **Distinctions** **across** **Texts** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Close Read: “Psychological Effects of Camp” – RI.8.2 (30 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can determine a central idea and analyze its development over the course of the article ‘Psychological Effects of Camp.’”

- Distribute and display **Text**: “ **Psychological** **Effects** **of** **Camp**.” Focus students on the **Close** **Readers** **Do** **These** **Things** **anchor** **chart**, and remind them that digging into a text deeply can help them understand it better, so they are going to dig deeply into an article titled “Psychological Effects of Camp” through close reading.

- Move students into predetermined pairs. Use the **Close** **Reading** **Guide**: “ **Psychological** **Effects** **of** **Camp** ” (**for** **teacher** **reference**) to set the purpose of the close read and to guide students through a close read of this section. Refer to the guide for how to integrate the following:

- **Close** **Read**: “ **Psychological** **Effects** **of** **Camp** ” **note** - **catcher**

- **Close** **Read**: “ **Psychological** **Effects** **of** **Camp** ” **note** - **catcher** ▲

- Refer to Close Reading Guide: “Psychological Effects of Camp” (for teacher reference) and **Close** **Read**: “ **Psychological** **Effects** **of** **Camp** ” **note** - **catcher** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as necessary.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- During the close read in Work Time A, as students determine the gist of each section, have them record it on sticky notes, in margins, or on a separate sheet of paper. This will help students both to process the information in the text, and to have a reference that will help them as they answer the questions on their Close Read: “Psychological Effects of Camp” note-catchers.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time A, invite students who need heavier support to use the Close Read: “Psychological Effects of Camp” note-catcher ▲. This resource includes scaffolding to help students respond to individual questions.

- In Work Time A, if students struggle to generate immediate answers to the questions in the close read, group students into pairs or triads, and assign each group two to three discussion questions. Then, regroup students to report their answers to one another. This will give students more time to examine and interpret the text and develop their responses.

Closing and Assessment

A. Culminating Task – RI.8.2 (5 minutes)

- Display and distribute **Close** **Read**: “ **Psychological** **Effects** **of** **Camp** ” **Culminating** **Task**. Read the question aloud for students, and field any issues before students work independently to complete the culminating task.

- Monitor students’ work as they complete the task, referring to **Close** **Read**: “ **Psychological** **Effects** **of** **Camp** ” **Culminating** **Task** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as needed.

- Distribute and display the **Lessons** **from** **Internment** **note** - **catcher**. Read aloud the directions, and ensure students understand that for homework, they will write a summary of the first section of the article in the first box. In the second box, they will list evidence from *Farewell to Manzanar* of the negative psychological effects of camp. They will complete the third box in the following lesson. Display and review the **Criteria** **for** **an** **Effective** **Informational** **Summary** **anchor** **chart**. If students need additional support, have them Think-Pair-Share to orally summarize the first section of the article “Psychological Effects of Camp.” Consult the **Lessons** **from** **Internment** **note** - **catcher** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) to support students in rehearsing their summaries.

- Explain to students that they will use this note-catcher throughout the first half of Unit 3 to gather evidence for a collaborative discussion in their mid-unit assessment on lessons from internment.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from “Psychological Effects of Camp.” Consider providing ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Invite students who need lighter support to predict some of the questions that the Language Dive may ask. This will improve students’ metacognition and challenge their awareness of the most interesting or meaningful elements of the sentence. Students may also choose to carry out one of the following:

- Paraphrase the sentence using your own words.

- Underline all noun phrases, circle all verb phrases, and star all adjective and adverb phrases. What words do you have left?

For Heavier Support

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from “Psychological Effects of Camp.” Consider providing ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Encourage students who need heavier support to independently reflect on this sentence and its meaning before the next lesson. Students may also choose to carry out one of the following:

- Make a guess about what the chunks of the sentence might be.

- Use a dictionary to look up the word *prejudices*, and select the best definition for the word as it is used in this sentence.

Homework

A. Add Evidence to Lessons from Internment Note-Catcher

- Students write a summary of the first section of the article “Psychological Effects of Camp.” Then they add evidence from *Farewell to Manzanar* and any other texts to their Lessons from Internment note-catchers.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent** **reading** **journal**.
