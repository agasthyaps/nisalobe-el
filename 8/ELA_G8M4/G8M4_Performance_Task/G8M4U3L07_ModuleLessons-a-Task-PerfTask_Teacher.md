Performance Task: Activist Organization  
Interview Preparation

SL.8.6

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** In the next lesson, you and your triad are going to call one of the community activist organizations that you have researched in order to interview a representative from that organization. Fill in this handout to help you prepare your phone script and the interview questions that you will use during your call with the organization.

**Sample Phone Script**

1.  Hello, our names are **Asa, Samir, and Kristina.**

2.  We are Grade 8 students at **Sunnyside Middle School.**

3.  Our class is learning about **the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II.**

4.  Through our studies, we have identified overarching lessons that can be learned from this dark time in history.

5.  These lessons include **“It is wrong to view entire populations as homogeneous”**

and **“Upholding the rights of other human beings is critical work.”**

6.  We are now looking for local organizations **whose work connects in some way to these lessons and contributes to a better world.**

7.  We have researched your organization, and we would like to learn more about what your organization does for our community.

8.  **May we conduct a brief interview with you?** May we record this interview?

9.  We have five questions, and the interview should only take a few minutes.

**What is the purpose of each sentence in this phone script?**

1 and 2: To greet the person who answers the phone and introduce ourselves.

3 and 4: **To describe our studies and give context for our interview request.**

5: To provide examples that show what we have learned in class.

6: **To explain the purpose of the phone call.**

7: To explain how this organization was found.

8: To ask permission for an interview.

9: **To give the person on the phone a clear sense of how much this interview will require of them.**

**Our Interview Questions**

1.  Question to confirm our understanding of what the organization does, based on our research.

Our understanding is that your organization **helps provide refugees in our community with the resources and services that they need to survive and be successful.**

Is that correct? Is there anything you would like to add?

10. Question to connect the organization’s work to a lesson from internment.

How does your organization **uplift and support other human beings?**

11. Question to connect the organization’s work to another lesson from internment.

How does your organization **see people as distinct individuals, rather than as members of a large homogenous group?**

12. Question to learn more about how people can get involved with the organization.

**How can people get involved with this organization? What are the priority needs and wants that people can help with for this organization? What events are scheduled?**

13. Question to get permission to follow up with another call or more questions.

**Would you be open to my reaching out to you in the future for more information, or to invite you to attend a class presentation of all of our local organizations?**
