Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.8.3 – Opening A: Students infer significant ideas from the connections across or distinctions among events and/or individuals in a text.

- RI.8.4 – Work Time A: As they read chapter 2 of *Farewell to Manzanar*, students determine the meanings of words as they are used in the text.

- L.8.4 – Work Time A: As they read chapter 2 of *Farewell to Manzanar*, students use strategies to determine the meanings of words in the text.

- RI.8.3 – Work Time B: Students participate in a Language Dive to explore the connection and relationship between Japanese Americans and non-Japanese Americans during World War II before the start of the Japanese American internment.

- RI.8.3 – Closing and Assessment A: Students analyze how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become ethical people by showing respect and empathy as they reflect on the Wakatsuki family’s experiences and working to become effective learners by collaborating as they work together with their peers throughout the lesson.

- In the chapter of *Farewell to Manzanar* read in this lesson, Jeanne’s mother and brother demonstrate perseverance and collaboration as they work to provide for the family and keep everyone together.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- As students read and learn more about the events involved in Japanese American internment in *Farewell to Manzanar*, invite students to research particular aspects of this time period that are of interest to them, such as Terminal Island, Boyle Heights, or other Japanese American internment experiences. Consider providing questions like the following to guide this exploration:

- Who were the key individuals involved? How are they connected? What distinctions are there between these individuals?

- What are the key ideas or events? How are these ideas or events connected? What distinctions are there between these ideas or events?

- Release more responsibility more quickly to students as they comprehend the tasks or concepts:

- Students who finish the entrance ticket quickly can read more of the “Power of Words Handbook” and share the main ideas and key details with their classmates.

- Allow those students who are able to read and identify gist independently to do so.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students have focused on working as a class to analyze how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in *Farewell to Manzanar*. In this lesson, students continue practicing this analysis with more independence, working in pairs.

Support All Students

- Consider reading aloud the first several chapters of *Farewell to Manzanar* in these first lessons to ensure student comprehension, engagement, and enjoyment of the text. However, if all students are already engaged, determine how students will read chapter 2 of *Farewell to Manzanar* to best support their comprehension, or give students choice to build empowerment and engagement in learning. Alternatives to read-alouds include another fluent reader (including students or an audiobook) reads aloud to the whole class, small groups, triads, or pairs; individuals read silently; or a combination of any of these. Also as necessary, consider prehighlighting one or two key sentences in each subsection which articulate the gist.

- In chapter 2, Jeanne examines some of her earliest attitudes toward other Asian people. This includes a description of her “fear of Asian faces” (10) that she attributes to growing up surrounded by white people. Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this chapter that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually. To support students in processing this content, ask: “What habit of character did you use as you read and discussed this excerpt?” Students may need to draw on perseverance, empathy, and compassion as they read and discuss this content, being sensitive to their own and others’ reactions to the information presented.

- As in Lesson 2, in Work Time A, present additional options for recording gist rather than just the sticky note, such as using a separate notebook, graphic organizer, using highlighters and annotating, or a voice recorder. Alternatively, give students options for expressing their understanding of gist (oral, written, or drawing). Also, build in different options for expressing comprehension of the text (written reflection, voice recording, or discussion with partners/groups). ▲

- During the Language Dive in Work Time B, students may need to consult a dictionary to verify the meanings of words in order to carry out work with figurative language and connotation. Ensure students have access to a dictionary for this portion of the lesson. ▲

- Before the Language Dive in Work Time B, consider reviewing the form and function of gerunds. This will help students to navigate work with participle phrases and to draw clear distinctions between the function of gerunds and participles. ▲

- Students may need additional support with analyzing authors’ methods in Closing and Assessment A. As needed, provide examples of relevant methods or invite students to find or create examples to share with classmates. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson incorporates familiar practices and reading strategies during the in-class reading of the text, a gradual release of support in making connections in the text (RI8.3), and opportunities to collaborate with peers. The lesson also includes a Language Dive that invites students to explore the relationship between Japanese Americans and non-Japanese Americans during World War II (RI.8.3), the authors’ use of figurative language in *Farewell to Manzanar*, and the use of a participle phrase to provide description (L.8.1a). The Language Dive will help to prepare students for both the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment and the End of Unit 1 Assessment.

- ELLs may find it challenging to identify connections and distinctions in the text. Help students to dissect individual sentences and language in the text, as well as the authors’ methods, as much as possible to enable them to understand deeper connections and distinctions. Additionally, encourage students to recall and apply the strategies for answering selected response questions they learned during previous modules. Pair students strategically to ensure that ELLs have appropriate support from peers during collaborative activities.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.A.1, 8.I.A.2, 8.I.B.6, and 8.II.A.1.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Connections and Distinctions note-catchers to ensure students understand how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in *Farewell to Manzanar*.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue to read *Farewell to Manzanar*, working independently to analyze how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in *Farewell to Manzanar*.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Introduce Significant Ideas Anchor Chart – RI.8.3 (5 minutes)

- Invite students to retrieve their **Connections** **and** **Distinctions**: ***Farewell to Manzanar* note** - **catchers**. Then, display the **Significant** **Ideas**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **anchor** **chart**. Explain that, as students read *Farewell to Manzanar*, they will be tracking their understanding of significant ideas that are conveyed in the text.

- Draw student attention to the top of the anchor chart, which features the criteria for a significant idea. Read these criteria aloud. As needed, clarify that, in this module, a significant idea is an understanding that readers infer from a text. It often emerges from connecting events and/or individuals in a text to create a deeper understanding of some important aspect of the text. This can be different from a central idea, which explains what a text is about. Significant ideas might just be related to one element of the text, like an event or individual. Recognizing significant ideas helps us understand the text more deeply because we have a better understanding of people’s relationships, motivations, and fears, and how events play a part in these.

- Point out the example significant idea on the anchor chart: *Jeanne’s* *youth* *impacts* *her* *understanding* *of* *and* *reactions* *to* *events* *in* *the* *text*. Point out that this significant idea is related to the first example on students’ note-catchers about the distinction between Jeanne’s and Mama’s reactions to Papa’s absence. Invite students to reread the example explanation of this distinction on their note-catchers.

- Turn and Talk:

“How does this distinction between Jeanne’s and Mama’s reactions convey the significant idea that Jeanne’s youth impacts her understanding of events in the text?” (Responses will vary, but may include: Jeanne’s reaction to Papa’s absence shows that she doesn’t fully understand why Papa was taken away or how it might affect the family. The distinction between Jeanne’s and Mama’s responses makes this significant idea more clear.)

- Add the following note to the second table of the anchor chart as a model:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Jeanne’s youth impacts her understanding of events in the text.</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>How do the authors convey this significant idea?</p>
<p><strong>Distinction between Jeanne’s and Mama’s reactions to Papa’s absence that show that Jeanne does not understand why Papa was taken away or what might happen to the family (8)</strong></p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

- Tell students that they will continue to add to this anchor chart across Units 1 and 2 as they read and analyze *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- After students complete Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 3, build in time to discuss the vocabulary from “The Power of Words Handbook.” Use Goal 4 Conversation Cues.

Work Time

A. Read *Farewell to Manzanar*, Chapter 2 – RI.8.4, L.8.4 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can determine the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary in chapter 1 of *Farewell to Manzanar*.”

- Repeated routine: Read chapter 2 in ***Farewell to Manzanar***. Use the **Text** **Guide**: ***Farewell to Manzanar* (for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students who are ready to read independently or in small groups should be released to do so. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky** **notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary in their **vocabulary** **logs**, update the **Gist**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **anchor** **chart**, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Refer to the **Gist**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **anchor** **chart** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) and **Work** **to** **Become** **Ethical** **People** **anchor** **chart** as needed.

- If students do not finish reading the chapter within the allotted reading time, distribute **Synopsis**: ***Farewell to Manzanar,*** **Chapter** **2** to each student to review the key details from the chapter.

- Prompt students to Turn and Talk:

“What is the gist of chapter 2?” (Jeanne’s family moves to Terminal Island; Jeanne is scared of the island kids because they are Asian and rough; the US government moves Jeanne’s family to the ghetto of Boyle Heights and then a few months later to Manzanar.)

- With students’ support, record the meanings of *Samurai* (a warrior in the service of a lord in medieval Japan), *patriarch* (a man who is the leader of a family or tribe), *remoteness* (the quality of being at a far distance in space or time), *anguish* (terrible pain or suffering of the mind or body), *chow* / *mess* (food; a meal eaten by a group), and *tarpaper* (a thick, heavy paper saturated or coated with tar, used as a waterproof underlay in roofing and for other building purposes) on the **academic word** **wall** and **domain** - **specific** **word** **wall**, with translations in students’ home languages. Write synonyms or sketch a visual above the words to scaffold students’ understanding. As necessary, review the term *ghetto* from Module 3. Invite students to record these words in their vocabulary logs.

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What examples of habits of character were evident in this chapter?” (Responses will vary, but may mention how Jeanne’s mother and brother demonstrate perseverance and collaboration as they work to provide for the family and keep everyone together.)

- Remind students that over the course of this unit, they will continue to track gist and habits of character.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Work Time

B. Language Dive: *Farewell to Manzanar*, Page 12 – RI.8.3 (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in *Farewell to Manzanar* to develop my understanding of the text.”

- Display the **Questions** **We** **Can** **Ask** **during** **a** **Language** **Dive** **anchor** **chart**. Ensure students understand how to use these questions, pointing out that the questions underlined on the anchor chart are questions that students should always ask when they dive into a sentence.

- Reread paragraph 2 on page 12 of *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- Focus students on the sentence below:

- “The secondhand dealers had been prowling around for weeks, like wolves, offering humiliating prices for goods and furniture they knew many of us would have to sell sooner or later.”

- Use the **Language** **Dive** **Guide**: ***Farewell to Manzanar***, **Page** **12** (**for** **teacher** **reference**) and **Language** **Dive**: ***Farewell to Manzanar***, **Page** **12** **Sentence** **Chunk** **Chart** (**for** **teacher** **reference**) to guide students through a Language Dive conversation about the sentence. Distribute and display the **Language** **Dive**: ***Farewell to Manzanar***, **Page** **12** **note** - **catcher** and the **Language** **Dive**: ***Farewell to Manzanar***, **Page** **12** **sentence** **chunk** **strips**. Refer to **Language** **Dive**: ***Farewell to Manzanar***, **Page** **12** **note** - **catcher** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- To extend work with participle phrases after the Language Dive in Work Time B, invite students to look for other examples of participle phrases functioning as adjectives in chapters 1 and 2 of *Farewell to Manzanar*. Students can share these examples with classmates in small groups or discuss as a whole class.

For Heavier Support

- To build in work the supporting standards during the Language Dive in Work Time B, consider the following:

- L.8.1c and L.8.3a: Students can replace *would* with other conditional verbs and verbs in other moods to explore the meaning and effects created by each one.

- L.8.2a:

“Can you figure out why the authors included a comma in front of like wolves?” (to indicate a pause, which emphasizes the information)

- L.8.4a: Students can discuss how context contributes to their understanding of individual words in the sentence.

- To extend work with participle phrases after the Language Dive in Work Time B, display other examples of participle phrases functioning as adjectives from chapters 1 and 2 of *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- “ . . . joining the line of boats heading out past the lighthouse, into the harbor” (4).

- “ . . . watching” (5).

- “ . . . wondering why everyone was crying” (8).

- “ . . . just quivering and glaring at the retreating dealer . . . ” (13).

Closing and Assessment

A. Analyze Connections and Distinctions: *Farewell to Manzanar*, Chapter 2 – RI.8.3 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in *Farewell to Manzanar* to develop my understanding of the text.”

- Ask students to retrieve the Connections and Distinctions: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catcher. Review the directions, fielding any outstanding questions after yesterday’s lesson.

- Ask a student to revoice the definition of *significant* to help ground the students as they begin to analyze the significant connections and distinctions in chapter 2.

- Focus students on the chapter 2 table on the note-catcher. Point out that the distinctions and connections for this chapter are provided in the note-catcher.

- Direct students to work with a partner to add in the methods for each of the listed distinctions and connections on the Connections and Distinctions: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catcher. Remind them to use the **Authors’** **Methods** **anchor** **chart** as needed. Then direct them to collaboratively write the explanation for the third row—distinctions between Ocean Park, Terminal Island, Boyle Heights, and Manzanar.

- Using a total participation technique, such as **equity** **sticks**, call on a few pairs to share their initial thoughts. Refer to **Connections** **and** **Distinctions**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **note** - **catcher** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**). As students share, be sure to unpack methods terms and definitions as needed and add examples from chapter 2 for relevant methods used to the Authors’ Methods anchor chart. Refer to the **Authors’** **Methods** **anchor** **chart** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as necessary.

- With 5 minutes remaining in the period, distribute **Exit** **Ticket**: **Unit** **1**, **Lesson** **3**. Direct students to complete the questions. Explain that the question formats used on the exit ticket will be used on the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment, which is focused on connections and distinctions. Collect and review the responses to check for understanding. Refer to **Exit** **Ticket**: **Unit** **1**, **Lesson** **3** (**answers** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Draw students’ attention to the Significant Ideas anchor chart, and ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What significant idea is conveyed by this distinction in this chapter?” (Responses will vary, but may include: The distinctions in places the family lived show how drastic the changes were for them. They went from a stately home near the beach to ghettos and then to even worse conditions of unfinished barracks in the camp. These differences in the living conditions emphasize how Manzanar was completely unlivable and how it affects each member of the family, especially Mama and her sense of dignity.)

- Add the significant idea to the anchor chart. Refer to **Significant** **Ideas** **anchor** **chart** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- Distribute a pre-annotated copy of the text excerpt, highlighting key statements in the text with notes or small drawings that illustrate meaning. This support will help direct students’ mental energy toward the goal of this activity (making connections between events and ideas), rather than meaning-making.

Homework

A. Analyze Connections and Distinctions

- Students finish completing the note-catcher for chapter 2 as needed.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent** **reading** **journal**.
