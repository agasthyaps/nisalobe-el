Language Dive: *Farewell to Manzanar*, Page 12 Sentence Chunk Chart

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

The secondhand dealers had been prowling around for weeks, like wolves, **offering humiliating prices** for goods and furniture they knew many of us would have to sell sooner or later. (from page 12 of *Farewell to Manzanar* by Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston and James D. Houston)

The secondhand dealers

Deconstruct

- **secondhand dealers**

“What do you think secondhand dealers do? Can you give an example?” (They buy people’s used belongings and resell them to someone else. Anything can be resold, but common items include household goods, clothing, and books. \[subject/noun phrase\])

- Students can take 30 seconds to work in pairs to list things they think **secondhand dealers** might sell.

had been prowling around for weeks, like wolves,

Deconstruct

- Ask:

“Can you find a simile in this chunk?” (like wolves is a simile.)

- **, like wolves,**

“Why do you think the writer used this comparison to describe the secondhand dealers?” (Because wolves are known to circle their prey before attacking. The secondhand dealers were nearby and waiting to buy Japanese Americans’ belongings for very low, unfair prices. \[preposition + noun = adverb phrase\])

- **  
  prowling around**

“How can the phrase like wolves help you to figure out the meaning of prowling around?” (Like wolves tells us prowling around is something that wolves do. We know that wolves are hunters that wait on their prey, so we can guess that prowling might mean that someone is waiting to attack. \[phrasal verb\])

“What does the connotation of prowling around convey about the secondhand dealers?” (that the secondhand dealers were waiting for an opportunity to take advantage of Japanese Americans)

- Students can act out this chunk to internalize the meaning of **prowling around** and **, like wolves,**.

- Students can generate a list of similes that use animals for comparison and discuss the meaning of each one. They can also consider examples of what they might use each simile to describe.

offering humiliating prices

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- **humiliating**

“What does the connotation of the word humiliating convey about the Wakatsuki family’s experience?” (Humiliating has a strong connotation, and it tells us that the Wakatsuki family and other Japanese Americans were extremely ashamed and embarrassed by the prices being offered to them from the secondhand dealers. \[adjective\])

- **offering**

“Can you figure out the function of offering? Is it a noun, a verb, an adjective, or an adverb? How do you know?” (It’s an adjective. We know this because it’s describing the noun phrase the secondhand dealers. \[-ing participle\]

- Consider explaining to students that in addition to functioning as verbs and nouns (gerunds),  
  **-ing** words can function as adjectives. We call these participles, or participle adjectives. This chunk is an example of a participle phrase, which is a phrase that functions as an adjective.

- **Students can use Conversation Cues as they discuss. To provide heavier support, display a suggested sequence, such as the one below:**

- Goal 1: Let’s take time to think and write or sketch.

- Goal 1: Can you give an example?

- Goal 2: Who can repeat what they said?

- Goal 4: Who can explain why they came up with that response?

- Students can consult a dictionary or thesaurus to find synonyms for **humiliating**. Students can then discuss the differences in connotation among words with similar meanings (e.g., **embarrassing**, **shameful**). To extend this activity, provide students with large paint chips (these can usually be purchased at a hardware store) and have students write **humiliating** on the darkest shade, and then lighter synonyms on lighter shades.

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Students had been huddling at their tables, like football players,

(Students had been huddling at tables, like football players, <u>discussing the next play</u>.)  Step 3

- To provide lighter support: “What happens if we move the participle adjective phrase somewhere else in the sentence?”

- To provide heavier support: Invite students to sketch or act out students huddling around tables like football players to help them better understand the meaning of this sentence.

for goods and furniture they knew many of us would have to sell sooner or later.

Deconstruct

- Ask:

“Why did Jeanne and her family need to sell their household goods and furniture?” (because they were being forced to relocate farther away from the naval base by the US government \[preposition + noun phrase\])

- **would**

“How would the meaning of this chunk be different if the authors had used a different conditional verb like might or could?” (The use of the conditional verb would conveys some certainty that the family will have to sell their belongings. Might and could express possibility but not certainty. \[conditional verb\])

“How do you think Jeanne and her family felt knowing that they would have no choice but to sell their belongings? What words or phrases in this chunk and in other chunks add to your understanding of this?” (They likely felt taken advantage of, ashamed, and helpless. Prowling, like wolves, humiliating, would have to sell all help us to understand this.)

- Students can take 30 seconds to discuss in groups other examples from the text of the hardships Japanese Americans faced as they prepared for forced relocation.

The secondhand dealers had been prowling around for weeks, like wolves, offering humiliating prices for goods and furniture they knew many of us would have to sell sooner or later.

Reconstruct

- Ask:

“What does this sentence tell us about the relationship between Japanese Americans and some non-Japanese Americans during World War II?” (Responses will vary but should include that this sentence provides an example of how Japanese Americans were being taken advantage of by some non-Japanese Americans. This suggests that Japanese Americans were not seen as equals or treated with respect by those outside of the community and that there was tension.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the big idea that internment camps uprooted people from their homes and communities, stripped them of their rights, confiscated their personal property, and forced them to live and work in these concentration camps?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to say that this sentence provides information about the early stages of this process, when Japanese Americans were forced to relocate from their homes.)

Practice (Sentence)

- Students can reflect on the tense relationship between Japanese Americans and those outside of the community during World War II as presented in the first two chapters of *Farewell to Manzanar* and complete the following sentence frame.

> The relationship between Japanese Americans and those outside the community had been growing tense, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
>
> simile participle phrase
>
> (**like** + noun (+noun) = simile)
>
> (\[verb + **-ing**\] + noun phrase = participle phrase)
>
> (The relationship between Japanese Americans and those outside the community had been growing tense, <u>like fire and ice, resulting in unfair treatment of Japanese Americans</u>.)  Step 4

- To provide lighter support: “What if we divide this sentence into two or more sentences? What do we have to remove or change?”

- To provide heavier support: Provide students with selected response options for the simile and **-ing** phrase.
