Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.8.4 – Opening A: On an entrance ticket, students analyze the impact of specific word choices on establishing the mood of the camp before the riots.

- RI.8.4 – Work Time A: As they read chapters 8–9 of *Farewell to Manzanar*, students determine the meanings of words as they are used in the text.

- L.8.4 – Work Time A: As they read chapters 8–9 of *Farewell to Manzanar*, students use strategies to determine the meanings of words in the text.

- SL.8.1a - Work Time B: Students participate in a Language Dive to examine a sentence that will help them prepare for a collaborative discussion.

- L.8.1b –Work Time B: Students participate in a Language Dive to examine a sentence that uses a verb in passive voice.

- L.8.3a –Work Time B: Students participate in Language Dive to consider how the use of passive voice impacts meaning in a sentence.

- RI.8.3 – Closing and Assessment A: Students analyze how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become ethical people by showing respect and empathy as they reflect on the Wakatsuki family’s experiences and working to become effective learners by collaborating as they work with peers and participate in a discussion.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- As students read and learn more about the events involved in Japanese American internment in *Farewell to Manzanar*, invite students to research particular aspects of this time period that are of interest to them, such as psychological effects of internment, corruption in the administration of internment camps, riots in internment camps, or the role of the American Friends Service Committee in helping the internees. Consider providing questions like the following to guide this exploration:

- Who were the key individuals involved? How are they connected? What distinctions are there between these individuals?

- What are the key ideas or events? How are these ideas or events connected? What distinctions are there between these ideas or events?

- Release more responsibility more quickly to students as they comprehend the tasks or concepts:

- Students who finish the entrance ticket quickly can start reading chapters 8 and 9.

- Allow those students who are able to read and identify gist independently to do so.

- To support ELLs, this lesson includes repeated routines with supported in-class reading, finding gist, and work with RI.8.3, and features a Language Dive that provides students with an opportunity to consider the impact of Japanese Americans being interned at Manzanar. This work will help to prepare students for the collaborative discussion during the End of Unit 1 Assessment in Lesson 12, which focuses on the causes and impacts of Japanese American internment camps.

- ELLs may find it challenging to work with passive voice during the Language Dive in Work Time B. Though L.8.1b and L.8.3a have been assessed in earlier modules and students have had extensive practice with passive voice, some ELLs may still experience difficulty in identifying and using this structure and, additionally, with grasping how the use of passive voice impacts meaning and creates particular effects. Support students by extending work with this structure after the Language Dive to continue to build proficiency in interpreting and using the passive voice.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.A.1, 8.I.A.2, 8.I.B.6, and 8.II.A.1.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students have focused on analyzing how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in *Farewell to Manzanar* and how this helps develop understanding of the text. In this lesson, students continue practicing this analysis and drawing on it as they practice collaborative discussion skills.

Support All Students

- Note that there is a differentiated version of Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 10 used in Opening A in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Chapters 8 and 9 contain content that may be distressing for some students. In chapter 8, Jeanne’s father is drunk and beats Jeanne’s mother. Then Kiyo, Jeanne’s brother, defends their mother by punching their father in the face and runs away to an older sister’s barrack. In chapter 9, internees who are tired of unjust treatment riot and are shot at by US military police. Ten internees are injured; two are killed. Create space, like through a QuickWrite, for students to privately reflect on the content of these chapters and process their feelings about it. Construct thoughtful QuickWrite prompts that encourage empathy (e.g., How do you think Jeanne’s mother felt in this scene? How do Jeanne and Kiyo feel during and after this scene? Why do the rioters start the riot? Why do the military police shoot their guns into the crowd?). Review students’ QuickWrite responses, and check in with students as needed.

- As in Lesson 2, in Work Time A, present additional options for recording gist rather than just the sticky note, such as using a separate notebook, graphic organizer, using highlighters and annotating, or a voice recorder. Alternatively, give students options for expressing their understanding of gist (oral, written, or drawing). Also, build in different options for expressing comprehension of the text (written reflection, voice recording, or discussion with partners/groups). ▲

- Before the Language Dive in Work Time B, consider reviewing the structure of active and passive voice. This will help students to navigate work with passive voice and to carry out analysis around the impact its use has on meaning. ▲

- During the Language Dive in Work Time B, students may need to consult a dictionary to verify the meanings of words. Ensure students have access to a dictionary for this portion of the lesson. ▲

- Note that the Language Dive sentence focuses students’ attention on the emasculation that some men felt they experienced at Manzanar. This idea should be approached sensitively, in a way that explores ideas about gender norms that underlie emasculation and have changed over time. Center these attitudes in the individuals and the text rather than as ones that are unchanging or “correct.”

- To support ELLs, this lesson includes repeated routines with supported in-class reading, finding gist, and work with RI.8.3, and features a Language Dive that provides students with an opportunity to consider the impact of Japanese Americans being interned at Manzanar. This work will help to prepare students for the collaborative discussion during the End of Unit 1 Assessment in Lesson 12, which focuses on the causes and impacts of Japanese American internment camps.

- ELLs may find it challenging to work with passive voice during the Language Dive in Work Time B. Though L.8.1b and L.8.3a have been assessed in earlier modules and students have had extensive practice with passive voice, some ELLs may still experience difficulty in identifying and using this structure and, additionally, with grasping how the use of passive voice impacts meaning and creates particular effects. Support students by extending work with this structure after the Language Dive to continue to build proficiency in interpreting and using the passive voice.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.A.1, 8.I.A.2, 8.I.B.6, and 8.II.A.1.

Assessment Guidance

- As students practice collaborative discussion during the Language Dive, use the Grade 8 Speaking and Listening Informal checklist located on the Tools page (http://eled.org/tools) to provide feedback. The discussion is very brief, so consider focusing on select students who might need more feedback. There will be more practice opportunities before the first collaborative discussion assessment at the end of this unit.

- Review students’ Connections and Distinctions note-catchers to ensure students understand how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in *Farewell to Manzanar*.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will watch another segment of the film *Farewell to Manzanar*, practicing their discussion skills about the content of the film.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.8.4 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **1**, **Lesson** **10** or the optional **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **1**, **Lesson** **10** ▲. Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique to review their responses. Refer to **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **1**, **Lesson** **10** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- During Opening A, invite students who need heavier support to use **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 10** ▲. This resource features selected response options to help students organize and record their thinking.

Work Time

A. Read *Farewell to Manzanar*, Chapters 8–9 – RI.8.4, L.8.4 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can determine the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary in chapters 8–9 of *Farewell to Manzanar*.”

- Repeated routine: Read chapters 8 and 9 in ***Farewell to Manzanar***. Use the **Text** **Guide**: ***Farewell to Manzanar* (for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students who are ready to read independently or in small groups should be released to do so. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky** **notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary in their **vocabulary** **logs**, update the **Gist**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **anchor** **chart**, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Refer to the **Gist**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **anchor** **chart** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) and **Work** **to** **Become** **Ethical** **People** **anchor** **chart** as needed.

- If students do not finish reading the chapter within the allotted reading time, distribute **Synopsis**: ***Farewell to Manzanar,*** **Chapters** **8** – **9** to each student to review the key details from the chapter.

- Prompt students to Turn and Talk:

“What is the gist of chapter 8?” (Papa stays in the family’s barracks, drinks alcohol, and is abusive to the family members; other internees think he is an “inu” or traitor.)

“What is the gist of chapter 9?” (Some internees beat a man because they think he is helping the US officials; a cook is arrested for the beating; a riot ensues; two internees are killed; ten internees are injured.)

- With students’ support, record the meanings of *enflame* (intensify, increase), *oblivion* (state of forgetting or unconsciousness), *vulnerability* (open to being wounded or hurt), *emasculation* (to deprive of strength, weaken; deprive a man of his male identity or role), and *renounce* (disown, give up) on the **academic** **word** **wall**, with translations in students’ home languages. Write synonyms or sketch a visual above the words to scaffold students’ understanding. Invite students to record these words in their vocabulary logs.

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What examples of habits of character were evident in this chapter?” (Responses will vary, but may mention how Jeanne’s mother and brother demonstrate perseverance and collaboration as they work to provide for the family and keep everyone together.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Work Time

B. Language Dive: *Farewell to Manzanar*, Page 65 – SL.8.1a (10 minutes)

- Display the **Questions** **We** **Can** **Ask** **during** **a** **Language** **Dive** **anchor** **chart**. Ensure students understand how to use these questions, pointing out that the questions underlined on the anchor chart are questions that students should always ask when they dive into a sentence.

- Remind students to refer to the **Discussion** **Norms** **anchor** **chart** during the discussion as part of the Language Dive.

- Reread paragraph 1 on page 65 of *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- Focus students on the sentence below:

- “This kind of emasculation was suffered, in one form or another, by all the men interned at Manzanar.”

- Use the **Language** **Dive** **Guide**: ***Farewell to Manzanar***, **Page** **65** (**for** **teacher** **reference**) and **Language** **Dive**: ***Farewell to Manzanar***, **Page** **65** **Sentence** **Chunk** **Chart** to guide students through a Language Dive conversation about the sentence. Distribute and display the **Language** **Dive**: ***Farewell to Manzanar***, **Page** **65** **note** - **catcher** and the **Language** **Dive**: ***Farewell to Manzanar***, **Page** **65** **sentence** **chunk** **strips**. Refer to **Language** **Dive**: ***Farewell to Manzanar***, **Page** **65** **note** - **catcher** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

For Lighter Support

- To extend work with passive voice after the Language Dive in Work Time B, students can search *Farewell to Manzanar* for textual examples of passive voice. Students can then consider why the authors used passive voice and how the meaning of each sentence is impacted by this decision.

For Heavier Support

- To extend work with passive voice after the Language Dive in Work Time B, students can practice changing sentences from active to passive voice and vice versa. After rewriting each sentence, they can discuss how the shift impacts the meaning of the sentence and what effects it creates:

- Japanese Americans were interned at Manzanar by the US government.

- The Wakatsuki family shared mealtimes at home before coming to Manzanar.

Closing and Assessment

A. Analyze Connections and Distinctions: *Farewell to Manzanar*, Chapters 8–9 – RI.8.3 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in *Farewell to Manzanar* to develop my understanding of the text.”

- Ask students to retrieve the **Connections** **and** **Distinctions**: ***Farewell to Manzanar* note** - **catcher**.

- Remind students to use their gist understanding to help focus their attention on possible significant connections and distinctions in these two chapters. Chapter 8 is focused on Papa, and chapter 9 is focused on the tension and different perspectives among those in camp. These might be fruitful places to begin their analysis.

- Direct students to work with a partner to complete at least one connection or distinction in the tables for chapters 8 and 9 on the Connections and Distinctions: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catcher. Remind them to use the **Authors’** **Methods** **anchor** **chart** as needed. Refer to the **Authors’** **Methods** **anchor** **chart** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as necessary.

- Using a total participation technique, such as **equity** **sticks**, call on a few pairs to share their explanations. Refer to **Connections** **and** **Distinctions**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **note** - **catcher** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**). As students share, be sure to unpack methods terms and definitions as needed and add examples for relevant methods used to the Authors’ Methods anchor chart. Refer to the Authors’ Methods anchor chart (example for teacher reference) as necessary.

- Draw students’ attention to the **Significant** **Ideas** **anchor** **chart**, and ask them to Think-Pair-Share:

“What significant ideas are conveyed by the connections and distinctions in these chapters?” (Refer to Significant Ideas anchor chart \[example for teacher reference\].)

- Add the significant ideas to the Significant Ideas anchor chart.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Analyze Connections and Distinctions

- Students finish completing the note-catcher for chapters 8 and 9 as needed.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent** **reading** **journal**.
