<td colspan="2">[1] The authors show the distinction between Jeanne’s and her mother’s reactions to Papa’s absence by using exposition and reflection on page 8. [2] The authors explain that at first Mama was not too worried. [3] As days went by without information, she began to break down. [4] Finally, Mama starts weeping uncontrollably. [5] In contrast, the chapter ends with Jeanne “clinging” to her mother’s legs, “wondering why everyone was crying.” [6] Unlike her Mama, Jeanne wasn’t sad or worried. [7] That is because she couldn’t understand the seriousness of the events. [8] This is a significant moment in the text because it begins to illustrate how Jeanne’s perspective as a child was very different from her mother’s and the other adults. [9] The adults had more context and awareness of the terrible possibilities.</td>

<td colspan="2"><strong>The authors show a connection between Papa and “the enemy” by using description and similes on pages 6 and 7. They describe all the items that Papa possessed that were seen as “evidence” of his crime of working against the US government. These items included the Japanese flag, his fishing license, and boating equipment. As a result, Papa was treated as a criminal when the FBI came for him. The text also uses the simile to make the direct comparison: “He was suddenly a man with no rights who looked exactly like the enemy.” This connection is significant because this kind of thinking by the US government allowed the internment to happen. Acting on the assumption that all Japanese Americans were loyal to Japan rather than the United States, the government acted on fear and prejudice, using “evidence” that seemed to prove the theory to justify the relocation and internment of its own people.</strong></td>

<td colspan="2"><strong>The authors show distinctions between the places the Wakatsukis live by using description. The house in Ocean Park was “a big frame house with a brick fireplace, a block back from the beach” (9). This description is very different from their house on Terminal Island. The Island itself is described as “a ghetto owned and controlled by the canneries.” The house was “nothing more than a shack, a barracks with single plank walls and rough wooden floor, like the cheapest kind of migrant workers’ housing” (11). Similarly, the authors describe Boyle Heights negatively as “another minority ghetto” (13). Finally, the authors describe Manzanar with the most details, giving the most negative impression. Some phrases that convey this are “barbed-wire fence,” “rows of black barracks,” and “blurred by sand” (17). The barracks are nothing like their family home in Ocean Park. They are described as having “one bare bulb hanging from the ceiling,” “army cots, two brown army blankets each, and some mattress covers” stuffed with straw (19). These distinctions between the four places that the Wakatsukis live are significant because they show how drastic the change was for them. They went from a stately home near the beach to ghettos and then to even worse conditions of unfinished barracks in the camp. These differences in the living conditions emphasize how Manzanar was completely unlivable and how it affects each member of the family, especially Mama and her sense of dignity.</strong></td>

<td colspan="2"><strong>The authors show a distinction between Mama’s and Woody’s attitudes toward the conditions in the camp by the use of dialogue and description. When the family wakes up covered in dust, the authors first use description to show Mama’s reaction of anger and frustration, “her eyes scanning everything—bare rafters, walls, dusty kids” (22). But then Woody’s joking dialogue interrupts Mama’s reaction and shows his own determined and caring response. He jokes, “You guys fall into the same flour barrel as us?” (22). He continues to joke with the kids, getting them to plug the holes. His dialogue continues to show his care of his family as he asks if Mama is okay. The authors describe how “her eyes blazed” as she says, “Woody, we can’t live like this. Animals live like this” (24). Woody’s response shows his determination and care as he hugs Mama and says, “We’ll make it better, Mama. You watch” (24). This distinction between Mama’s and Woody’s reactions to the camp conditions is significant because it develops their characters. Through this distinction, the reader learns that Mama is a strong woman who cares deeply about providing for her family. Woody also cares for his family, but he does so in a lighthearted, determined way.</strong></td>

<td colspan="2"><strong>The authors show a connection between internment life and life in the military by using examples and description. The authors describe how “the War Department was in charge of the camps” (26). The internees were issued military clothing. The authors also give examples of how as in the military, the living quarters in Manzanar were called “barracks” (29), the dining hall the “mess” or “chow line” (27), and the bathrooms “latrines” (28). This connection is significant because although the internees were put into the camps against their will, they were treated as if they were part of the military. Normally the military fights for and support for its own country, but the people put in the camps were suspected of being against the country. It’s clear the US government really didn’t know what to do and wasn’t prepared when this plan was put into action.</strong></td>

| **The authors show a distinction between Papa before and Papa while in camp by using anecdote and description. The authors describe Papa with a “dark, bitter, brooding presence” (59). They also relate the anecdote of his drunken violence and abuse to his wife and children. The authors tell how this new Papa is “unfamiliar” and a “demon” compared with the man who “lived in Ocean Park” (63). This distinction is significant because it illustrates how seriously the internment experience affected Papa especially. The trauma of internment was made even worse by the suspicion toward him by other Japanese internees. He was no longer the same person as a result of this experience.** |                              |

| **The authors show a distinction between the different perspectives toward the conflict happening in camp by using narration and dialogue. The authors tell how some men suffered from the internment and accusations of disloyalty. They, like Papa, tried to escape by drinking and hiding in the barracks. Others, like Tayama, became “friends” to the camp administrators (66). Others, like the cooks and Joe Kurihara, “struck back” in the riot. The authors use dialogue to show that although Mama hid during the riot, she understood the rioters’ reaction as she says, “Maybe they would be treated like human beings” (67). This distinction is significant because it shows how the stress of the camp experiences caused splintering within the Japanese community and the Wakatsuki family. The environment of the camp divided the internees.** |                            |

| **The authors show a connection between Japan’s national anthem and enduring life in the internment camp by using this allusion. The authors include a verse of the national anthem. They explain that it can “be read as a proverb, a personal credo for endurance” (81). When Papa sings these words after being called a traitor, it shows how he uses the message of the national anthem to draw strength. It also helps him to survive the internment and its injustices. This connection is significant because it shows a long history of perseverance and thriving existence. It also shows that there may still be hope for a better life after the experience of camp. It also illuminates Papa’s conflicted loyalties between his two countries.** |                            |

| **The authors use the mountains as an analogy to the ways of thinking by the internees that helped them to survive. They write, “If anything made that country habitable it was the mountains themselves” (87). They explain that the mountains were “important for all of us, but especially for the Issei” because they reminded them of Japanese mountains (88). They also gave people like Papa “spiritual sustenance” because they reminded him of “powerful and inevitable forces” that people “must simply endure” (88). This is a significant connection, because like the Japanese national anthem, it conveys the idea that though the internees experienced much suffering and injustice in the camps, they endured and were able to push through to survive, just like the mountains.** |                               |

| **The authors show distinctions between Jeanne’s perceptions of her school teacher, Lois, the Odori teacher, and the ballet teacher by the way she categorizes and describes them. The two Caucasian women (teacher and Lois) are described positively. The teacher is “the best teacher I ever had” (94). Lois is “pretty” and “young” (95). In contrast, the authors describe the two Japanese women (Odori and ballet) more critically and negatively. The Odori teacher is “so old,” “foreign,” and “an occult figure, more spirit than human” (98). The ballet teacher is “overweight,” “sad to watch,” and has “lines in her face” and “traces of gray in her black hair” (100–101). This is a significant distinction because it reveals the ambivalence and tension Jeanne feels between the different parts of her identity: American and Japanese. Jeanne often felt disconnected from her Japanese identity even before Manzanar. It seems that that experience reinforces and strengthens that disconnect for her.** |                                  |

| **The authors show a distinction between the diminishing closeness Jeanne feels with her parents and the increased closeness her parents felt toward each other by using the anecdote about the delivery of Eleanor’s baby and Jeanne’s later reflections. Jeanne felt “cut off from both” her parents in this moment (106). Their happiness at Eleanor’s baby gives them an “intimacy that made \[Jeanne\] invisible to them” (108). This distinction is significant because though this realization was likely to have happened even if they were still in Ocean Park, the circumstances of camp life and the danger of childbirth there amplified the situation and the emotions. This event allowed Jeanne to witness this moment between her parents at a time where she was also feeling disconnected from them.** |                             |

| **The authors show a connection between Woody’s departure from camp to the war and Papa’s being taken into custody by the FBI in chapter 1 by the use of Jeanne’s reflection. For Jeanne, Woody’s departure “was almost like watching Papa leave again” (111). The departures are similar to Jeanne because “if anything happened” to either of them “the world would probably be coming to an end” for Jeanne (111). This connection is significant because it shows the impact internment life had on Jeanne. It also reminds us that Jeanne’s perspective as a young child was different from the rest of her family. Having already had her father taken away for something she could not understand, she is now watching her brother go away and again not understanding because of her age.** |                              |

| **The authors show a distinction between Jeanne’s ideas about being outside camp as an American and the reality faced by the internees as they were forced to reintegrate into society through the use of an anecdote and Jeanne’s reflection. Jeanne and her parents hear “ominous reports” of violence toward Japanese Americans outside of the camps (116). What she faced outside of camp was not violence but “humiliation” and “hatred” (118). This distinction is important because again it shows Jeanne’s affinity toward and belief in her American identify over her Japanese identity. It also conveys the ways in which Jeanne’s age impacted her understanding and perception of Manzanar. It is only later that she realizes her belief in “the outside” might not be realistic or accurate.** |                             |

| **The authors show a connection between the two bombings through the use of Jeanne’s reflection. Each of the two bombings incited dramatic change for Jeanne and her family. Pearl Harbor marked all Japanese in the United States as the enemy and instigated the internment camps. Likewise, Hiroshima marked the end of the war and the end of the camps, prompting another dramatic change for the family. The authors write, “in the same way that the first attack finished off one period in our lives, so this appalling climax marked the end of another” (126). This connection is significant because it shows the personal side of these wartime acts and how much each impacts the lives of people as it begins and ends. It also shows the ways that the US government’s actions brought harm to its own citizens based on assumptions and fear.** |                  |

| **The authors use the cloud metaphor to convey Jeanne’s ideas about the hatred she and her family expect to feel once they leave Manzanar to return to life in California. Jeanne saw the hatred as “an amorphous cloud that would descend from above and enclose \[the family\] forever” (136). This connection is significant because it conveys the ways in which the prejudice and hatred toward the Japanese engulfed all aspects of life for those who were released. These feelings were caused by the war and the government’s efforts to brand all Japanese as enemies. The impact of this hatred was something that was ever present and beyond the control of those who had to endure it. It was another way the internment experience left its lasting legacy.** |                               |

| **The authors show a distinction between Woody and Papa in the wake of their return to normal life by the use of examples. The authors tell how “while Woody grew, Papa seemed to shrink” (149). Before internment, Papa “had been the skipper. Now he depended more and more on Woody” (149). This distinction is significant because it conveys the long-term effects of internment. Both became different people as a result of their experiences, and in some ways switched roles. For elder Papa, the repeated defeats and failed plans fed into his loss of identity as the head of family and was something he was unable to recover from. In contrast, Woody found a way to embrace and take the best from all that he experienced to become the new solid foundation for the family.** |                              |

| **The authors show a distinction between Jeanne’s and Papa’s ideas about what it means to be feminine and what’s appropriate for Jeanne as a teenage girl. Papa tells Jeanne that for a young woman “modesty” and “a graceful body” are important (159). For Jeanne, what is most important is acceptance as an American girl who walks “with shoulders straight” and “an assertive stride” (159). This distinction is significant because it shows the further disconnect Jeanne feels toward her father. It also conveys the tension Jeanne feels between the American and Japanese parts of her identities. She tries to disconnect from all that’s Japanese in order to be accepted by the Caucasian American world, and she sees Papa as trying to keep her from that.** |                            |
