Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 10

RI.8.4

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, read the sentences from chapter 8 and chapter 9, and respond to the questions.

“But that was not what crowded the room. It was Papa himself, his dark, bitter, brooding presence” (59).

“During that first summer and fall of sandy congestion and wind-blown boredom, the bitterness accumulated, the rage festered in hundreds of tarpapered cubicles like ours” (66).

**Part A**

What can you infer about the mood of the camp as conveyed in these two sentences? How does this mood compare to that in earlier chapters? (RI.8.4)

A. The mood conveyed by these two sentences is that things are calm, and people are beginning to relax and enjoy camp.

B. <u>The mood conveyed by these two sentences is that things are tense, and people are beginning to get angry, bitter, and impatient.</u>

C. The mood conveyed by these two sentences is that things are uneventful, and people are beginning to get bored, inactive, and tired.

D. The mood conveyed by these two sentences is that things are hopeful, and people are beginning to think things will improve.

Responses will vary but may include (B.): The mood conveyed by these two sentences is that tensions are high, and people are beginning to get angry, bitter, and impatient. This is different than in earlier chapters, which showed the mood as somewhat light, even if difficult and unpleasant. It seems that people worked together and helped one another, but now something different is happening.
