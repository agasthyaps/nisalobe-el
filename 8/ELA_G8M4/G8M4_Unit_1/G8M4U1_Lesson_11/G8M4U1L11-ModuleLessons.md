Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RL.8.7 – Opening A: On an entrance ticket, students confirm understanding of terms related to film elements.

- RL.8.7 – Work Time A: Students use note-catchers to track the choices of the filmmakers of *Farewell to Manzanar* to convey the text.

- RL.8.7 – Closing and Assessment A: Students draw connections between the text and the film *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- In this lesson, students also focus on becoming effective learners by persevering as they watch another segment of *Farewell to Manzanar* and continue to add to their note-catchers.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Continue to build upon the entrance ticket and reinforce work with RL.8.7 by inviting students to analyze a scene from a favorite movie that has been adapted from a familiar text. Students can watch a scene, tracking the filmmakers’ choices about setting, music and sound, and/or body language. Then, students can informally discuss or write about the impact of the filmmakers’ choices on the scene overall. If students know the original text well, they can also reflect on the extent to which the scene in the film is similar to or different from the scene in the text. These tasks can be done independently as homework, collaboratively in pairs/triads, or as an entire class.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students read the chapters of *Farewell to Manzanar* that correspond to the film segment shown in Work Time A of this lesson. In this lesson, they continue to add to their Compare Text to Film: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catchers, which they began in Lesson 4.

Support All Students

- Taking notes while watching the film segment may be challenging for some students, as taking meaningful notes in class requires both a high level of listening comprehension and the ability to write quickly. Consider ways to scaffold this exercise for students who need heavier support, such as giving time for students to skim and review chapters 3–7 and 9 of the text before beginning the film segment, which contains content from these chapters. ▲

- To support ELLs during Work Time A, use closed captioning to add English subtitles to the film. ▲

- In this segment of the film, there are verbal arguments between the family members and between the other internees. Some students may find these scenes upsetting. Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually. To support students in processing this content, ask: “What habit of character did you use as you watched and discussed this excerpt?” Students may need to draw on perseverance, empathy, and compassion as they read and discuss this content, being sensitive to their own and others’ reactions to the information presented.

- If necessary, to support student note-taking, pause the film at the end of moment as indicated in the Text to Film note-catcher. ▲

- To support ELLs, this follows a similar sequence to Lesson 4. Students view the second section of the film adaptation of *Farewell to Manzanar*, which aligns with the chapters of *Farewell to Manzana* r that students read in Lessons 6-10, reinforcing this content. As they watch the film, students will continue to track the film choices made by the director, screenwriter, and actors using a note-catcher and then share their observations about how significant ideas are portrayed in the film compared to the text with classmates in the Closing and Assessment of the lesson.

- ELLs may find it challenging to record notes while they watch the film, as this requires careful attention to both visual and linguistic input (the film’s content) and output (writing on the note-catcher). Encourage students to take notes using simple words and phrases while watching and to then go back and refine what they have written immediately after viewing the film. Remind students that the sequence of events in the film may not follow the sequence of events in the text exactly and to be mindful of differences and potentially new content as they watch.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standard 8.I.B.6.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Compare Text to Film note-catchers to ensure that students are meaningfully and accurately describing the filmmakers’ choices regarding particular film elements.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will complete the End of Unit 1 Assessment. They participate in a collaborative discussion to address one of the module’s guiding questions. In Unit 2, students continue analyzing the film *Farewell to Manzanar* and adding to their Compare Text to Film note-catchers. The information collected on their note-catchers will inform their literary argument essays during the End of Unit 2 Assessment.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RL.8.7 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **1**, **Lesson** **11**.

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique to review their responses. Refer to **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **1**, **Lesson** **11** (**answers** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons. Direct students’ attention to the **Work** **to** **Become** **Effective** **Learners** **anchor** **chart**, and tell students that the habit of character to focus on in this lesson is perseverance.

For Lighter Support

- After completing Entrance Ticket, Unit 1, Lesson 11, invite students to give examples of how the film elements of setting, music and sound, and body language were used in the first segment of the film adaptation of *Farewell to Manzanar*, which students viewed in Lesson 4. This will help students to deepen their understanding of each element and set them up for success in viewing the second segment of the film in this lesson.

For Heavier Support

- To help students fully grasp the film elements on Entrance Ticket, Unit 1, Lesson 11, show examples from the film adaptation of *Farewell to Manzanar* that illustrate the examples of setting, music and sound, and body language. This will help students to deepen their understanding of each element and set them up for success in viewing the second segment of the film in this lesson.

Work Time

A. Analyze *Farewell to Manzanar*, Part 2 – RL.8.7 (30 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze the extent to which the film *Farewell to Manzanar* stays faithful to or departs from the text, evaluating the filmmakers’ choices.”

- Tell students that they are now going to watch another segment of the film ***Farewell to Manzanar*** and continue adding to their **Compare** **Text** **to** **Film**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **note** - **catchers** from Unit 1, Lesson 4. Invite students to retrieve their note-catchers, and give them a moment to review their earlier notes to remind themselves of their work surrounding the first film segment.

- Draw students’ attention to the second table on the note-catcher. Ask students to note the moments of focus described in the left-hand column of the table. Remind students that these moments are the sections of the film segment that they will focus on as they watch. Notes in the left-hand column should focus on filmmakers’ choices. Students can refer to their entrance tickets for examples of filmmakers’ choices as needed.

- Refer students to the page numbers included in the right-hand column of the second table. Remind students that this is where these moments can be found within the chapters they have already read. Ask students to retrieve their copies of the text ***Farewell to Manzanar*** and give them a few minutes to revisit these pages, reminding themselves of the content and the way that the authors have conveyed these moments in the text.

- Students can refer to their entrance tickets for additional examples of appropriate answers as needed.

- Remind students to keep in mind the habits of character on the Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart and the **Work** **to** **Become** **Ethical** **People** **anchor** **chart** as they watch the film.

- Use the **device** to show the second segment of the film *Farewell to Manzanar* (00:27:31–00:52:46). As students watch, monitor their attention and progress on their note-catchers, providing encouragement and clarification as needed. If necessary, to support student note-taking, pause the film at the end of moment as indicated in the Compare Text to Film note-catcher. Refer to the **Compare** **Text** **to** **Film**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **note** - **catcher** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as needed.

- After students watch the first segment, provide a few moments for students to clean up, clarify, or add to their notes. Remind students that they can refer back to the anchor text, *Farewell to Manzanar*, as they work.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- Before students view the second segment the film adaptation of *Farewell to Manzanar* in Work Time A, invite them to make a list of significant ideas from chapters 3–9 of the text. This will help to orient students to the film viewing task and help them to focus on key events, ideas, and individuals from the text.

For Heavier Support

- To help students navigate the content of the second film segment, cut the bullet points from each row in the first column of the Compare Text to Film: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catcher (example for teacher reference) into strips to make a tactile activity. Students can put the strips in order as they watch the film and then record the key ideas and events on their Compare Text to Film: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catchers.

Closing and Assessment

A. Make Connections to Text – RL.8.7 (10 minutes)

- Draw students’ attention to the right-hand column of the first and second tables in the Compare Text to Film note-catcher, and read the additional question in each row: how do these moments convey significant ideas from the text? Remind students that this note-catcher is intended to help students understand how the filmmakers use film elements to convey significant ideas from the text.

- Display the following significant idea: Papa felt painfully conflicted because of his loyalties to both the United States and Japan. Students likely produced a similar answer on their **Close** **Reading** **Culminating** **Task**: ***Farewell to Manzanar***, **Chapter** **7** handouts from Unit 1, Lesson 9. Students completed this task after participating in a close reading of chapter 7 from the text and then discussed their answers to the task during a collaborative discussion at the end of that lesson.

- Tell students that they should work in triads to share and examine the notes they have collected so far for the first and second film segments. Within their notes, they should locate choices made by the filmmakers that help convey the idea that Papa feels conflicted because of his loyalties to both the United States and Japan. In triads, students will discuss how these choices convey this significant idea and then add notes that represent their thinking to the corresponding section of right-hand columns of the first two tables on the note-catcher.

- Circulate around the room, and monitor students’ responses as they discuss and complete this section of their note-catchers. Take note of students who may need additional support, and check in with them moving forward.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Complete Compare Text to Film Note-Catcher

- As necessary, students add notes to their Compare Text to Film: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catcher, drawing on their anchor text and Connections and Distinctions note-catchers to determine how the film is faithful to or departs from the text. They also analyze how the moments in the text and film develop significant ideas.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread chapter 11 (pages 73–82) of *Farewell to Manzanar* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.
