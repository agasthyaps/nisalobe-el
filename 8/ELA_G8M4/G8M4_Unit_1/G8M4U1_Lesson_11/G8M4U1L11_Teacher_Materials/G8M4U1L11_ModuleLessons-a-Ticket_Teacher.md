The items below feature examples of the film elements in the table above. On the blank line, write the film element that the examples indicate.

1\. **<u>Setting</u>**: The clouds are dark, like a storm is about to arrive; slick, modern skyscrapers are in the skyline; discarded trash is on the ground.

2\. **<u>Music and sound</u>**: A sad, slow flute can be heard in the background; the characters sing

their national anthem together; low piano signals that danger is coming.

3\. **<u>Body language (including facial expressions)</u>**: The actor avoids eye contact with other characters; the actor’s eyebrows are furrowed together; the actor stands tall with straight posture and her hands on her hips.
