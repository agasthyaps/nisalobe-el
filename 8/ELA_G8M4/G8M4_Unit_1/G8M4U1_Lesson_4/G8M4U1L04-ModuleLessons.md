Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RL.8.7 – Opening A: On an entrance ticket, students confirm understanding of terms related to film elements.

- RL.8.7 – Work Time A: Students use note-catchers to track the choices by the filmmakers of *Farewell to Manzanar* to convey the text.

- RL.8.7 – Closing and Assessment A: Students draw connections between the text and the film *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- In this lesson, students also focus on becoming effective learners by persevering as they watch the first segment of *Farewell to Manzanar* and begin to complete a new note-catcher.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Build upon the entrance ticket and reinforce work with RL.8.7 by inviting students to analyze a scene from a favorite movie that has been adapted from a familiar text. Students can watch a scene, tracking the filmmakers’ choices about voiceover, camera work, and/or events. Then, students can informally discuss or write about the impact of the filmmakers’ choices on the scene overall. If students know the original text well, they can also reflect on the extent to which the scene in the film is similar to or different from the scene in the text. These tasks can be done independently as homework, or collaboratively in pairs/triads or as an entire class.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students read chapters 1 and 2 of *Farewell to Manzanar* and made connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, and events in those chapters. In this lesson, students watch the first segment of the *Farewell to Manzanar* film, which corresponds to chapters 1 and 2 of the book.

Support All Students

- The segment of *Farewell to Manzanar* that students watch in this lesson contains content that may be distressing for some students. Though no scenes include graphic images, scenes do depict the fear felt by Jeanne’s family at the prospect of being evacuated and/or separated from one another. That the family’s evacuation and internment was ordered due to racist attitudes toward Japanese Americans at the time may also be upsetting for students. Create space, like through a QuickWrite, for students to privately reflect on this segment of the film and process their feelings about it. Construct thoughtful QuickWrite prompts that encourage empathy (e.g., How do you think Jeanne’s mother felt as she read the evacuation notice aloud?). Review students’ QuickWrite responses, and check in with students as needed.

- Taking notes while watching the film segment may be challenging for some students, as taking meaningful notes in class requires both a high level of listening comprehension and the ability to write quickly. Consider ways to scaffold this exercise for students who need heavier support. This may include giving time for students to skim and review chapters 1 and 2 of the text before beginning the film. ▲

- To support ELLs during Work Time A, use closed captioning to add English subtitles to the film. ▲

- If necessary to support student note-taking, pause the film at the end of moment as indicated in the Compare Text to Film note-catcher. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson includes a scaffolded introduction to film elements as students begin viewing the film adaptation of *Farewell to Manzanar*. Students will watch the first of four film segments in this lesson, which aligns with the chapters of *Farewell to Manzanar* that students read in Lessons 2 and 3, reinforcing this content. As they watch the film, students will track the film choices made by the director, screenwriter, and actors using a note-catcher and then share their observations with classmates in the Closing and Assessment of the lesson.

- ELLs may find it challenging to record notes while they watch the film, as this requires careful attention to both visual and linguistic input (the film’s content) and output (writing on the note-catcher). Encourage students to take notes using simple words and phrases while watching and to then go back and refine what they have written immediately after viewing the film. Remind students that the sequence of events in the film may not follow the sequence of events in the text exactly and to be mindful of differences and potentially new content as they watch.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standard 8.I.B.6.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Compare Text to Film note-catchers to ensure that students are meaningfully and accurately describing the filmmakers’ choices regarding particular film elements.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will read two more chapters of *Farewell to Manzanar* and complete tasks that are similar to those of the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment. Students will watch the remaining three segments of *Farewell to Manzanar* in lessons across Units 1 and 2.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RL.8.7 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **1**, **Lesson** **4**.

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique to review their responses. Refer to **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **1**, **Lesson** **4** (**answers** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons. Direct students’ attention to the **Work** **to** **Become** **Effective** **Learners** **anchor** **chart**, and tell students that the habit of character to focus on in this lesson is *perseverance*.

For Lighter Support

- After students complete Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 4, invite them to share examples of how filmmakers have made choices about the elements of film in popular movies. Students can share these examples with small groups or with the class as a whole.

For Heavier Support

- After students confirm the precise meanings of *sequence*, *blocking*, and *voiceover*, as needed, allow time for students to use dictionaries to confirm the precise meanings of additional words from the entrance ticket, as needed.

Work Time

A. Analyze *Farewell to Manzanar*, Part 1 – RL.8.7 (35 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze the extent to which the film *Farewell to Manzanar* stays faithful to or departs from the text, evaluating the filmmakers’ choices.”

- Tell students that, in four lessons across Units 1 and 2, they are going to watch the ***Farewell to Manzanar* film**. The work they complete as they watch the film will inform the literary argument essays that they write during Unit 2. Explain that when a text is made into a film, it is important to recognize how faithfully that film captures the text. Students will conduct this analysis in the four film-watching lessons.

- Distribute the **Compare** **Text** **to** **Film**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **note** - **catcher**. Read the directions aloud and field any immediate questions. Draw students’ attention to the first table. Point out the sample responses in both columns of row 1 and in the right-hand column of row 2.

- Invite students to discuss the provided sample answers about the first and second moments in the film. Turn and Talk:

“What do you notice and wonder about the note-catcher and/or sample answers?” (Responses will vary.)

- Students can refer to their entrance tickets for additional examples of filmmakers’ choices as needed.

- Clarify that students should focus on completing the left-hand column of the first table as they watch the film. Because the right-hand column requires students to use their texts and Connections and Distinction note-catchers, they will have several minutes after viewing and for homework to complete this work. Also explain to students that the second question in the second column about significant ideas requires a deep understanding of significant ideas in the text. Students will answer the significant ideas questions later, after more of the text has been read and analyzed.

- Finally, note that this film segment contains content from chapters 1, 2, 6, and 22. Since students have only, at this point, read chapters 1 and 2, some of the film content may be new or unfamiliar to them.

- Remind students to keep in mind the habits of character on the Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart and the **Work** **to** **Become** **Ethical** **People** **anchor** **chart** as they watch the film.

- Use the **device** to show the first segment of the film *Farewell to Manzanar* (00:00:00–00:27:30). As students watch, monitor their attention and progress on their note-catchers, providing encouragement and clarification as needed.

- Pause the film after the party scene (00:05:36), and read aloud the sample notes in each column of the first row on the Compare Text to Film note-catcher, reminding students that the notes in the left-hand column describe the moment in the film including the choices the filmmakers made. The notes in the right-hand column compare the film to the text.

- Before starting the film again, ask students to review the notes in the right-hand column of the second row. They can also use their anchor text, gists, or their **Connections** **and** **Distinctions**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **note** - **catcher** to review the text version of these moments (Papa burns the Japanese flag, Mama reads newspaper, Mama breaks china, family arrives at Manzanar). Then play the remaining minutes of the film segment (to 00:27:30), pausing at the end of each moment as necessary for students to take notes.

- After students watch the first segment, provide a few moments for students to clean up, clarify, or add to their notes. Remind students that they can refer back to the anchor text, ***Farewell to Manzanar***, and their Connections and Distinctions note-catcher as they work.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- Before students view the first segment the film adaptation of *Farewell to Manzanar* in Work Time A, invite them to make a list of significant ideas from chapters 1 and 2 of the text. This will help to orient students to the film viewing task through review and help them to focus on key events, ideas, and individuals from the text.

For Heavier Support

- To help students navigate the content of the first film segment, cut the bullet points from each row in the first column of the Compare Text to Film: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catcher (for teacher reference) into strips to make a tactile activity. Students can put the strips in order as they watch the film and then record the key ideas and events on their Compare Text to Film: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catchers.

Closing and Assessment

A. Peer Share: Compare Text to Film Note-Catchers – RL.8.7 (5 minutes)

- Direct students to pair up and share their notes about Film Segment 1 on their note-catchers. Each student will give one star and one step to help improve their partner’s notes about the choices regarding the three elements in the first segment of the film.

- Monitor students’ discussions, and use specific questions to cue students to think with others and expand the conversation:

“How is what you wrote different from what your partner wrote?”

“Can you explain why your partner described the voiceover choices in this way?”

“Can you add to your partner’s ideas about the camera work in this scene?”

- Invite students to reflect on the habit of character focus in this lesson, perseverance, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Complete Compare Text to Film Note-Catcher

- As necessary, students add notes to their Compare Text to Film: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catcher, drawing on their anchor text and Connections and Distinctions note-catchers to determine how the film is faithful to or departs from the text.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread chapters 3–4 (pages 21–30) of *Farewell to Manzanar* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.
