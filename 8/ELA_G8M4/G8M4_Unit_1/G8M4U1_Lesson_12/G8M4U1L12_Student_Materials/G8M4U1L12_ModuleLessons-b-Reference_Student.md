Synopsis: *Farewell to Manzanar*, Chapter 11

**Name:** **Date:**

- A new camp director gives each family at camp a Christmas tree. Jeanne doesn’t enjoy Christmas because she doesn’t like the gifts, it is windy, and Papa is drunk.

- In February, everyone seventeen and older is required to fill out a “Loyalty Oath” pledging loyalty to the US government. They must respond “Yes Yes” or “No No.” If they respond “Yes Yes,” they will have to fight in the war for the United States. If they respond “No No,” they risk being sent back to Japan.

- Papa does not want to sign the Loyalty Oath or become a soldier, and he gets into arguments with everyone about this, including Woody. Papa doesn’t believe that it is possible to fight a war for something he doesn’t believe in.

- Papa attends a meeting about the Loyalty Oath. He decides to say “Yes Yes” because he doesn’t want the government to send him back to Japan and others to call him an **inu**, the Japanese word for traitor or spy. Papa gets into a fight with another man, and Jeanne hears Papa call the man **eta**, the Japanese word for trash.

- There is a sandstorm, and Papa goes inside to the barracks and is silent. He soon begins singing the Japanese National Anthem and crying.

- Jeanne later learns that Papa would sing the Japanese National Anthem as a child.

- The Japanese National Anthem is a special poem about moss growing on a stone. It symbolizes endurance and survival.
