Track Progress: Collaborative Discussion

**Name:** **Date:**

**Learning Target:** I can participate in an effective collaborative discussion.

**Standards I’m Tracking:** SL.8.1

1.  How am I doing?

- For each criterion, self-assess by putting a check mark in the appropriate column.

- Strive to be honest with yourself. Remember, your ability grows with your effort, so it’s fine if you aren’t there yet!

You will receive feedback on different-colored sticky notes/flags, and in a different-colored pen, on the checklist.
