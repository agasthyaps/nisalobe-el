Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.8.4 – Work Time A: As they read chapter 11 of *Farewell to Manzanar*, students determine the meanings of words as they are used in the text.

- L.8.4 – Work Time A: As they read chapter 11 of *Farewell to Manzanar*, students use strategies to determine the meanings of words in the text.

- Work Time B: Students complete the End of Unit 1 Assessment. Students synthesize their learning on part 1 of *Farewell to Manzanar* by engaging in a QuickWrite and an academic discussion centered on the first module guiding question: what were the causes and impacts of Japanese American internment camps? The focus of this assessment is on using evidence and following norms during collaborative discussion (SL.8.1a, SL.8.1b).

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become ethical people by showing respect and empathy as they reflect on the causes and impacts of Japanese American internment and working to become effective learners by collaborating as they work with peers and participate in a discussion.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- As students read and learn more about the events involved in Japanese American internment in *Farewell to Manzanar*, invite students to research particular aspects of this time period that are of interest to them, such as psychological effects of internment, the *War Relocation Authority Application for Leave Clearance*, the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, and the Japanese national anthem. Consider providing questions like the following to guide this exploration:

- Who were the key individuals involved? How are they connected? What distinctions are there between these individuals?

- What are the key ideas or events? How are these ideas or events connected? What distinctions are there between these ideas or events?

- Release more responsibility more quickly to students as they comprehend the tasks or concepts:

- Allow those students who are able to read and identify gist independently to do so.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students have practiced preparing for and engaging in collaborative discussion about *Farewell to Manzanar*. In this lesson, students participate in the first of two assessed collaborative discussions. The focus of this assessment is on preparing for and using evidence and following norms during collaborative discussion.

Support All Students

- Chapter 11 contains content focused on the effects of the loyalty oath, which causes tension between Woody and Papa and divides the camp. The tensions and divisiveness boil over into a physical altercation with Papa and someone from the opposing side. The conflict, tension, and violence might be upsetting for some students, as may be the level of emotion exhibited by Papa at the close of the chapter as he sings the Japanese national anthem. To support students in processing this content, ask: “What habit of character did you use as you read and discussed this excerpt?” Students may need to draw on perseverance, empathy, and compassion as they read and discuss this content, being sensitive to their own and others’ reactions to the information presented.

- As in Lesson 2, in Work Time A, present additional options for recording gist rather than just the sticky note, such as using a separate notebook, graphic organizer, using highlighters and annotating, or a voice recorder. Alternatively, give students options for expressing their understanding of gist (oral, written, or drawing). Also, build in different options for expressing comprehension of the text (written reflection, voice recording, or discussion with partners/groups). ▲

- If the class size is too large to facilitate a manageable discussion, consider using the Fishbowl protocol. Alternatively, the class could be divided into two groups and conduct their discussions simultaneously while being recorded. Whichever method is used, recording the discussion is recommended to be able to better assess students’ contributions.

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment.

- Some students may require more than the time allotted to complete the assessment.

- To support ELLs, this lesson uses a structured collaborative text-based discussion format for the End of Unit 1 Assessment. Students will discuss the module guiding question (“What were the causes and impact of Japanese American internment?”), applying what they have learned throughout the unit to provide evidence from the text to support their responses. Students will also have the opportunity to apply oral skills developed during the second half of the unit during targeted speaking practice during pair shares and peer critique tasks.

- ELLs may find it challenging to balance the contextual and linguistic demands of the collaborative discussion. For some students, a whole-group discussion may feel intimidating if they have been mainly working in pairs and small groups throughout the unit. Encourage students to focus on a few key pieces of evidence from *Farewell to Manzanar* that they know well and to utilize anchor charts and other resources to aid them in navigating the linguistic demands of the discussion.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.A.1, 8.I.A.2, 8.I.A.3, and 8.I.A.4.

Assessment Guidance

- The End of Unit 1 Assessment is included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback to students on this assessment, use End of Unit 1 Assessment Recording Sheet for assessing each student’s progress toward SL.8.1a andSL.8.1b. All SL.8.1 substandards will be assessed in the second collaborative discussion assessment in Unit 2.

Down the Road

- In the following lesson, students continue to read *Farewell to Manzanar* and analyze the connections among and distinctions between individuals, events, and ideas.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **1**, **Lesson** **12**. Students will also need their **Module** **4** **Mid** - **Unit** **1** **Assessment** **with** **feedback**.

- Once all students are ready, invite them to share their stars and steps with a partner. Remind students that everyone is working toward individual goals and that learning is about continued growth and development.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read *Farewell to Manzanar*, Chapter 11 – RI.8.4, L.8.4 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can determine the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary in chapter 11 of *Farewell to Manzanar*.”

- Repeated routine: Read chapter 11 in ***Farewell to Manzanar***. Use the **Text** **Guide**: ***Farewell to Manzanar* (for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students who are ready to read independently or in small groups should be released to do so. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky** **notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary in their **vocabulary logs**, update the **Gist**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **anchor** **chart**, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Refer to the **Gist**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **anchor** **chart (example for teacher reference)** and **Work** **to** **Become** **Ethical** **People** **anchor** **chart** as needed.

- If students do not finish reading the chapter within the allotted reading time, distribute **Synopsis**: ***Farewell to Manzanar,*** **Chapter** **11** to each student to review the key details from the chapter.

- Prompt students to Turn and Talk:

“What is the gist of chapter 11?” (All internees are asked to sign a loyalty oath; Papa fights with Woody and other internees about it, since it is insulting to both Japanese citizens and Japanese American citizens.)

- With students’ support, record the meanings of *divisive* (creating a division or separation), *repatriation* (the act of sending a person back to his or her country), *contingent* (a group or subset of people), *livid* (enraged, extreme anger), and *lament* (an expression of sorrow or grief) on the **academic word** **wall** and **domain** - **specific** **word** **wall**, with translations in students’ home languages. Write synonyms or sketch a visual above the words to scaffold students’ understanding. Invite students to record these words in their vocabulary logs.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Work Time

B. End of Unit 1 Assessment: Collaborative Discussion: *Farewell to Manzanar* – SL.8.1a, SL.8.1b (20 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can engage effectively in collaborative discussions about one of the module guiding questions by being prepared, drawing on my notes, and following rules for collegial discussions.”

- Direct students to the **Discussion** **Norms** **anchor** **chart**, specifically on the cues and responses. Remind students that a discussion is not just about saying what we want to say. Effective participation is about listening to others and asking and answering questions. Questions help us to be completely clear about what others are saying and to clarify our own points. Inform students that it’s important they build off one another’s ideas and ask questions of their peers to deepen their understanding throughout the discussion.

- Remind students of the focus standards for this discussion:

- “SL.8.1a: Come to discussions prepared, having read or researched material under study; explicitly draw on that preparation by referring to evidence on the topic, text, or issue to probe and reflect on ideas under discussion.”

- “SL.8.1b: Follow rules for collegial discussions and decision-making, track progress toward specific goals and deadlines, and define individual roles as needed.”

- Distribute and display **End** **of** **Unit** **1** **Assessment**: **Collaborative** **Discussion**: ***Farewell to Manzanar***.

- Read aloud the directions for the assessment as students read silently to follow along. Ensure all students understand the assessment directions. Answer their questions, refraining from supplying answers to the assessment questions themselves.

- Invite students to begin composing their QuickWrite. Refer to the **End** **of** **Unit** **1** **Assessment**: **Collaborative** **Discussion**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- After 5 minutes have passed, refocus students whole group.

- Focus students on the Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart and the **Work** **to** **Become** **Effective** **Learners** **anchor** **chart**. Remind students that it is not easy for everyone to participate in a discussion. Uplift the habits of respect, compassion, and empathy in preparation for the discussion.

- Begin the discussion, using the guiding questions. Use the **End** **of** **Unit** **1** **Assessment** **Recording** **Sheet** (**for** **teacher** **reference**) to assess students for SL.8.1a and SL.8.1b as they participate.

“What were the causes and impacts of Japanese American internment camps?” (Responses will vary, but may include any or all of the following:

- Japanese American internment camps were ordered by President Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War II to incarcerate hundreds of thousands of Japanese Americans in the western United States. These camps were established out of fear and prejudice toward Japanese American people after the attack on Pearl Harbor.

- Internment camps uprooted people them from their homes and communities, stripped them of their rights, confiscated their personal property, and forced them to live and work in unjust and inhumane conditions.)

- As time allows, use the following questions to extend the discussion:

“Based on your understanding of the text so far, what are some lessons that can be learned from Japanese American internment?” (Responses will vary, but may include any or all of the following:

- It is wrong to view entire populations as homogeneous.

- Fear and prejudice can cause people and institutions (governments) to hurt innocent people.

- Upholding the rights of other human beings is critical work.

- In times of terrible struggle, people can draw strength from their identities and communities.)

“What connections can you see between this module and our other modules this year?” (Responses will vary, but may include any or all of the following: connections to Holocaust module for the injustice, prejudice, hate, fear.)

- After discussion, remind students they will have more practice and another collaborative discussion assessment later in the module.

For Lighter Support

- Before Work Time B, review the Conversation Cues students have been using while practicing speaking skills associated with SL.8.1b. Work as a class to generate a list of sentence starters based on these, and other phrases, that students can refer to during the text-based discussion.

For Heavier Support

- In advance of the assessment, prepare individual sticky notes for students that include a list of sentence starters based on Conversation Cues that students can refer to during the discussion when they wish to elaborate or clarify information. These might include the following:

- “So, do you mean \_\_\_\_\_?”

- “Sure. I think that \_\_\_\_\_.”

- “OK. One example is \_\_\_\_\_.”

- “No, sorry, that’s not what I mean. I mean \_\_\_\_\_.”

Closing and Assessment

A. Track Progress: Collaborative Discussion (5 Minutes)

- Give students specific positive feedback on their completion of the End of Unit 1 Assessment (e.g., “I was pleased to see a lot of you referring to your note-catchers to find details”).

- Distribute **Track** **Progress**: **Collaborative** **Discussion** and **Track** **Progress** **folders**. Tell students that successful learners keep track of and reflect on their own learning.

- Tell students to focus on tracking their progress in the following criteria:

- SL.8.1a

- SL.8.1b

- Guide students through completing the form. Encourage students to orally paraphrase the meaning of the Track Progress criteria, self-assess, and discuss the evidence with a partner before they begin writing.

- Invite students to place the form in their Track Progress folder, and collect students’ folders.

For Lighter Support

- As with previous assessments, if students seem unsure of how to respond to the open-ended questions on the Track Progress: Collaborative Discussion handout, provide examples of statements that answer the questions about previous improvements and goals for future improvement that are directly connected to the criteria within the handout to help students create clear self-reflection and concrete, attainable personal targets such as the following:

- “I have improved at posing questions during collaborative discussions.”

- “In the future, I will improve my participation in a collaborative discussion by making more of an effort to acknowledge new information expressed by others.”

For Heavier Support
