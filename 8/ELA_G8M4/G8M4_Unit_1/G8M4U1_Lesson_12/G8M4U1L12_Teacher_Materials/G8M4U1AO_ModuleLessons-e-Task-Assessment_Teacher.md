End of Unit 1 Assessment: Collaborative Discussion: *Farewell to Manzanar*

SL.8.1a, SL.8.1b

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**QuickWrite**

To prepare for this discussion, QuickWrite in response to the following question (this is one of our module guiding questions):

- Based on your understanding of the text so far, what were the causes and impacts of Japanese American internment camps?

Remember to use details and examples from the unit texts to support and explain your thinking.

Responses will vary, but may include the following:

- Japanese American internment camps were ordered by President Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War II to incarcerate hundreds of thousands of Japanese Americans in the western United States. These camps were established out of fear and prejudice toward Japanese American people after the attack on Pearl Harbor.

- Internment camps uprooted people them from their homes and communities, stripped them of their rights, confiscated their personal property, and forced them to live and work in unjust and inhumane conditions.

**Collaborative Discussion**

You will participate in a collaborative discussion to discuss the above question and some additional questions as time allows.

Throughout the discussion, be sure to refer to the following materials:

- Your QuickWrite
