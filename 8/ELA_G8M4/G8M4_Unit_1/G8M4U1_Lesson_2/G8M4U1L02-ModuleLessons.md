Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.8.3 – Opening A: On an entrance ticket, students synthesize information from the infer the topic activity in Lesson 1, making connections among and distinctions between individuals involved in Japanese American internment.

- RI.8.4 – Work Time A: As they read the foreword, epigraphs, and chapter 1 of *Farewell to Manzanar*, students determine the meanings of words as they are used in the text.

- L.8.4 – Work Time A: As they read the foreword, epigraphs, and chapter 1 of *Farewell to Manzanar*, students use strategies to determine the meanings of words in the text.

- RI.8.3 – Work Time B: Students learn to analyze how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- RI.8.3 – Closing and Assessment A: Students share their note-catchers and collaborative explanation. They receive from, and provide feedback to, their peers to help refine their understanding about analyzing how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become ethical people by showing respect and empathy as they reflect on the Wakatsuki family’s experiences and working to become effective learners by collaborating as they work together with their peers throughout the lesson.

- In the chapter of *Farewell to Manzanar* read in this lesson, Jeanne’s father demonstrates integrity as he refuses to allow the FBI to take his dignity during his arrest.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- As students read and learn more about the events involved in Japanese American internment in *Farewell to Manzanar*, invite students to research particular aspects of this time period that are of interest to them, such as the different laws and acts passed to limit the rights of people of Japanese descent, Pearl Harbor, or other Japanese American internment experiences. Consider providing questions like the following to guide this exploration:

- Who were the key individuals involved? How are they connected? What distinctions are there between these individuals?

- What are the key ideas or events? How are these ideas or events connected? What distinctions are there between these ideas or events?

- Release more responsibility more quickly to students as they comprehend the tasks or concepts:

- Students who finish the entrance ticket quickly can answer similar questions about ideas and events around Japanese American internment: What are the ideas or events surrounding Japanese American internment? How are these ideas or events connected? What distinctions are there between these ideas or events?

- Allow those students who are able to read and identify gist independently to do so.

- An optional Mini Language Dive, intended for use after work with RI.8.3 in Work Time B, is available in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students have focused on inferring the topic of Japanese American internment. In this lesson, students draw on those inferences especially about individuals, ideas, and events as they begin to read and analyze *Farewell to Manzanar*.

Support All Students

- Note that there is a differentiated version of Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 2 used in Opening A in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Presenting learning targets in writing, orally, and if possible, accompanied by symbols will help students to understand the language within them. ▲

- Consider reading aloud the first several chapters of *Farewell to Manzanar* in these first lessons to ensure student comprehension, engagement, and enjoyment of the text. However, if all students are already engaged, determine how students will read the foreword, epigraph (quotes at the beginning of the chapter), and chapter 1 of *Farewell to Manzanar* to best support their comprehension, or give students choice to build empowerment and engagement in learning. Alternatives to read-alouds include another fluent reader (including students or an audiobook) reads aloud to the whole class, small groups, triads, or pairs; individuals read silently; or a combination of any of these. Also, as necessary, consider prehighlighting one or two key sentences in each subsection which articulate the gist.

- Provide the audiobook version of *Farewell to Manzanar* as an optional support for students’ comprehension throughout the module. ▲

- Chapter 1 describes the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the US government’s subsequent suspicion of Japanese Americans. Some passages in the chapter, though not graphic, may be upsetting for students to read and process. For example, one passage describes the morning when Jeanne’s father—“suddenly a man with no rights who looked exactly like the enemy” (7)—is taken away for interrogation by the FBI. As needed, create additional space for students to process the events of this chapter and practice empathy for Jeanne, her father, and her family. This may be done through a Chalk Talk, for instance, which would allow students to process quietly and in writing their answers to questions like, “How do you think Papa felt to have ‘become a man without a country’ (7)?”

- In Work Time A, present additional options for recording gist rather than just the sticky note, such as using a separate notebook, graphic organizer, using highlighters and annotating, or a voice recorder. Alternatively, give students options for expressing their understanding of gist (oral, written, or drawing). Also, build in different options for expressing comprehension of the text (written reflection, voice recording, or discussion with partners/groups). ▲

- Students may need additional support in understanding the characteristics of the genre of literary nonfiction. Help clarify for students that *Farewell to Manzanar* is a true story, and that while it may read like a novel, the characters and events within it are real.

- Students may need additional support with analyzing the authors’ methods in Work Time B. As needed, provide examples of relevant methods or invite students to find or create examples to share with classmates. ▲

- Pair students (especially ELLs) thoughtfully for pair share to build supportive and safe exchange. Vary these partners throughout the unit to expose students to diverse perspectives one on one. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson builds on the inferences students drew about the topic of Japanese American internment in Lesson 1. Students begin reading the module anchor text, *Farewell to Manzanar*, in a supportive in-class reading format that includes time to discuss and record the gist of each chapter. After reading, students are introduced to RI.8.3 and work with connections and distinctions among individuals, ideas, and events in the text and begin to use the Connections and Distinctions: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catcher to track their analysis. An Authors’ Methods anchor chart is introduced to help students identify particular language within the text that provides insight into connections and distinctions.

- ELLs may find it challenging to navigate a new and unfamiliar topic as they begin reading *Farewell to Manzanar*. Familiarity with the topic will vary among students, and some may need more support than others in understanding the historical context of Japanese American internment. Additionally, some students may need help in understanding that *Farewell to Manzanar* is a nonfiction text and not a novel. Remind students of the resources they explored during the Infer the Topic protocol and make these Infer the Topic resources, as well as other resources about Japanese American internment, available to students, as needed, to help them build understanding alongside their reading of the anchor text.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.A.1, 8.I.A.2, 8.I.B.6, and 8.II.A.1.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Connections and Distinctions note-catchers to ensure students understand how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in *Farewell to Manzanar*. Because this is the first of several lessons focused on this work, it is okay if students are still developing their understanding; use evidence and observations about their work during Work Time B and in Closing and Assessment A to make decisions about needed supports or additional instruction.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue to read *Farewell to Manzanar*, working in pairs or small groups toward independence in their analysis of how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in *Farewell to Manzanar*.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.8.3 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **1**, **Lesson** **2** or the optional **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **1**, **Lesson** **2** ▲. Students will need their **Infer** **the** **Topic**: **I** **Notice** / **I** **Wonder** **note** - **catcher** from Lesson 1 to complete this entrance ticket. Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique to review their responses. Refer to **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **1**, **Lesson** **2** (**answers** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

- With students, use the vocabulary strategies on the **Close** **Readers** **Do** **These** **Things** **anchor** **chart** to deconstruct the word *distinction* (recognition of differences). Record the word on the **academic** **word** **wall** with translations in home languages, where appropriate, and invite students to record the word in their **vocabulary** **logs**.

For Lighter Support

- This lesson is the first in a sequence of lessons with a focus on work with RI.8.3. In Opening A, stop after each learning target has been read to ask students what they think they will be doing in this lesson. Invite students to rephrase the learning target in their own words to ensure comprehension and build a strong foundation for the tasks in this lesson and the two that follow.

For Heavier Support

- Guide students to annotate their copies of Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 2 with synonyms and/or definitions for the terms *connections* and *distinctions*. This will help with carrying out the task at hand, while also building understanding of these terms as students begin their work with RI.8.3 throughout this unit.

Work Time

A. Read *Farewell to Manzanar*: Foreword, Epigraphs, and Chapter 1 – RI.8.4, L.8.4 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can determine the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary in chapter 1 of *Farewell to Manzanar*.”

- Distribute the text ***Farewell to Manzanar***, and ask students to examine the cover picture and read the title, subtitle, and back cover.

- Prompt students to Think-Pair-Share:

“Based on what you learned in the infer the topic activities in Lesson 1 and your examination of the cover, title, and subtitle, what do you think this text will be about?” (the author’s childhood experience of living in Manzanar, a Japanese American internment camp)

- Read aloud the first page of the foreword, up to “where my family spent three and a half years” (ix), and ask students to Turn and Talk:

“Who wrote the foreword?” (Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston)

“Who wrote the book?” (Jeanne and her husband, James)

“What was the Houstons’ purpose in writing the book?” (to describe and explain life in the camps)

- Continue reading aloud the foreword from “We began with a tape recorder” to “with the impact these years have had on my entire life” (ix–x). Prompt students to Turn and Talk:

“How did writing the book affect Jeanne?” (It brought up a lot of emotions and let her deal with those emotions and the memories of living in the camps.)

- Finish reading aloud the foreword, and ask students to Turn and Talk:

“How did the Houstons write this book? What kind of book is it?” (They gathered lots of information, personal stories, and historical details. The book is a memoir, the story of a family, not a historical book.)

“What is the gist of the foreword?” (Houstons wrote the book to tell about life in Japanese American internment camps, which helped Jeanne process her internment experience.)

- Record this gist on the **Gist**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **anchor** **chart**. As necessary, consult the **Gist**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **anchor** **chart** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Repeated routine: Read the epigraph (quotes at the beginning of the chapter) and chapter 1 in *Farewell to Manzanar*. Use the **Text** **Guide**: ***Farewell to Manzanar* (for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students who are ready to read independently or in small groups should be released to do so. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky** **notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary in their vocabulary logs, update the Gist: *Farewell to Manzanar* anchor chart, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Refer to the Gist: *Farewell to Manzanar* anchor chart (example for teacher reference) and **Work** **to** **Become** **Ethical** **People** **anchor** **chart** as needed.

- Prompt students to Turn and Talk:

“What is the gist of the epigraphs?” (Article: Japanese Americans interned for disloyalty but none were disloyal. Poem: Life’s challenges have given me wrinkles, but nature renews me.)

- If students need additional support in interpreting the figurative language in the poem, ask them to Think-Pair-Share:

“What is another way of saying that life has ‘left her footprints on my forehead’? What is the speaker saying about what life has been like and how it has affected the speaker’s face?” (Life has been challenging and given the speaker wrinkles.)

“Consider the images in the rest of the poem. What helps to renew the speaker or wipe the footprints from the speaker’s forehead?” (Nature renews the speaker.)

“What is the gist of chapter 1?” (Japan bombs Pearl Harbor, US naval base; the US government confiscates the property of and arrests people of Japanese descent living on the West Coast.)

- If students do not finish reading the chapter within the allotted reading time, distribute **Synopsis**: ***Farewell to Manzanar,*** **Chapter** **1** to each student to review the key details from the chapter.

- With students’ support, record the meanings of *naturalization* (the act, on the part of a government, of granting full citizenship to a foreign-born person), *alien* (someone who lives in a country who is not a citizen of that country), *evacuees* (people who have been removed from a place, especially for safety), *evacuation* (the removal of citizens, soldiers, or the like from an endangered place), *Issei* (first generation; people born in Japan), *Nisei* (second generation; people born in the United States; children of people born in Japan), *Sansei* (third generation; children of people born in the United States) and *saboteur* (a person who attacks or damages something, usually in secret) on the academic word wall and the **domain** - **specific** **word** **wall**, with translations in students’ home languages. Write synonyms or sketch a visual above the words to scaffold students’ understanding. As necessary, review the term *concentration* *camp* from Module 3. Invite students to record these words in their vocabulary logs.

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What examples of habits of character were evident in this chapter?” (Responses will vary, but may mention how Jeanne’s father demonstrates integrity as he refuses to allow the FBI to take his dignity during his arrest.)

- Remind students that over the course of this unit, they will continue to track gist and habits of character.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Work Time

B. Analyze Connections and Distinctions: *Farewell to Manzanar*, Chapter 1 – RI.8.3 (20 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, events, and ideas in chapter 1 of *Farewell to Manzanar* to develop my understanding of the text.”

- Distribute and introduce the **Connections** **and** **Distinctions**: ***Farewell to Manzanar* note** - **catcher**. Chorally read the directions. Point out that there are two authors for this text, hence the reference to “authors” as plural. Also remind students not to refer to the people in *Farewell to Manzanar* as characters as this text is narrative nonfiction; while it reads like a novel, it is, in fact, an informational text.

- Direct students’ attention to the word *significant* in the directions on the note-catcher.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What does the word *significant* mean?” (Responses will vary, but may include: important, worthy of attention, noteworthy, having particular meaning.)

- Explain that specific content in a text can have varying levels of significance. Likewise, the connections and distinctions made in a chapter by the authors will also have varying levels of significance. Remind students that they’ll be looking for connections and distinctions that seems to hold importance for the chapter and/or the whole book.

- Explain that authors use various methods to create connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, and events to help readers build understanding of the text. Careful readers take note of how a writer makes connections and distinctions among those individuals, events, and ideas. Explain that starting in this lesson, students will analyze some of those connections and distinctions and how they are made in *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- Display and introduce the **Authors’** **Methods** **anchor** **chart**. Remind students that they have learned about and worked with all these methods throughout the year and in previous years. Briefly, review the methods listed and their definitions. Explain that students will be learning more about each method and adding examples from the text to the anchor chart throughout this module. Explain that students are going to apply this beginning understanding about authors’ methods to chapter 1.

- Review the provided sample from chapter 1, modeling the thinking needed to complete it as well as how it shows the directions for the table. Refer to the Authors’ Methods anchor chart as needed when adding the methods. Note that the sample uses exposition/narration and reflection as its methods.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“Exposition/narration is direct explanation of a topic. The authors use narration when they tell the story of how Mama and Jeanne reacted. Why might an author use exposition/narration when writing a text?” (Responses will vary, but may include: it’s an efficient and quick way to convey information; it is clear and direct for a reader to process; it provides context and background to help situate readers before moving to more complex ideas, concepts, events.)

“Why might it be important to use other methods along with exposition when writing a text?” (Responses will vary, but may include: to make the writing more engaging and interesting to read, to make it more creative, to provide evidence to develop the ideas presented in exposition, to bring in other perspectives besides the authors’.)

“Reflection is direct thoughts of an individual shared with the reader. The authors use reflection when they tell how Jeanne remembers clinging to her Mama’s legs and not understanding what is happening. Why might an author use reflection when writing a text?” (Responses will vary, but may include: it’s an effective way for the writer to step into the moment with additional information gained with the passage of time; it adds another layer of meaning and lets the reader better understand what the writer has learned about this moment that she may not have understood or thought about at the time it originally happened.)

- Direct students to read the explanation for the sample.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What do you notice about the content of the first sentence of explanation?” (It names the pairing, the distinction, the methods used, and the location in the text.)

“What do you notice about the content of sentences 2 through 4?” (These sentences explain Mama’s reaction; they paraphrase evidence from the text to support the explanation.)

“What do you notice about the content of sentences 5 through 7?” (These sentences explain Jeanne’s reaction; they use evidence from the text to support the explanation; sentence 5 starts with “in contrast,” which highlights that this is a distinction).

“What do you notice about the content of sentences 8 and 9?” (These sentences explain the significance of this moment in the text and the meaning of the distinction.)

- Let students know they’re going to work as a class to complete this work for chapter 1. Focus students on the chapter 1 table on the note-catcher. Point out that one additional distinction (fishing trips) and one connection (Papa/enemy) for chapter 1 are provided in the note-catcher.

- Direct students to pages 6 and 7, and ask them to review the section that makes the connection between Papa and “the enemy.”

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What methods are used to convey this connection?” (Simile and description.)

- Call on students to share their initial thoughts. As students share, be sure to unpack methods terms and definitions as needed and add examples from chapter 1 for relevant methods used to the Authors’ Methods anchor chart. Refer to the **Authors’** **Methods** **anchor** **chart** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as necessary.

- Direct students to work with a partner to complete the Explanation box for this connection. Remind them to use the sample and their analysis of the sample to help them construct their explanations. Refer to **Connections** **and** **Distinctions**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **note** - **catcher** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Explain that students will share their explanations for feedback in the closing.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time B, as time allows, invite students to find examples of the methods listed on the Authors’ Methods anchor chart from previous modules or from independent research reading texts. Students can share and discuss their examples in small groups or with the class as a whole.

- In Work Time B, invite students to participate in a Mini Language Dive to explore how the authors use comparison to make a connection (RI.8.3). This Mini Language Dive also gives students the opportunity for work with a relative clause, a useful structure for description that students can apply in their own speaking and writing.

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from *Farewell to Manzanar*. Provide ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Invite students who need lighter support to predict some of the questions that the Language Dive may ask. This will improve students’ metacognition and challenge their awareness of the most interesting or meaningful elements of the sentence. Students may also choose to carry out one of the following:

- Paraphrase the sentence using your own words.

- Underline all noun phrases, circle all verb phrases, and star all adjective and adverb phrases. What words do you have left? What are the functions of these phrases?

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time B, to help students understand the concepts on the Authors’ Methods anchor chart, preselect additional examples for each method from previous texts used in previous modules. This will help students to better understand each method within the context of texts and topics they are deeply familiar with.

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from *Farewell to Manzanar*. Provide ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Encourage students who need heavier support to independently reflect on this sentence and its meaning before the next lesson. Students may also choose to carry out one of the following:

- Make a guess about what the “chunks” of the sentence might be.

- Use a dictionary to look up the word *prowling*, and select the best definition for the word as it is used in this sentence.

Closing and Assessment

A. Pair Share – RI.8.3 (5 minutes)

- Direct pairs to join another pair and share their explanations. Each pair will give one star and one step to help improve their explanation.

- As students meet, circulate, and review the responses and discussion to ensure students are developing a beginning understanding about how to analyze how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- Once pairs are done sharing, encourage them to make revisions to their note-catchers. Also field any new questions about the specifics of the explanation or the note-catcher. Explain that they will continue to analyze how connections and distinctions within a text help to develop our understanding of the individuals, events, and ideas in the text during the rest of Unit 1 and Unit 2.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- ELLs may find reading unfamiliar texts challenging. In preparation for the at-home reading assigned as homework, help students recall strategies for reading unfamiliar texts, generating a list as a class. Invite them to practice these strategies while reading from *Farewell to Manzanar* independently, at home. Examples:

- Chunk the text into manageable amounts, e.g., sentences or paragraphs.

- Circle unfamiliar words.

- Use context or a dictionary to define unfamiliar words.

- Annotate unfamiliar words with synonyms.

- Underline important people, places, and things.

- Read aloud.

- Read repeatedly.

- Silently paraphrase the chunks.

- Summarize what you read for someone else, perhaps first in your home language.

Homework

A. Analyze Connections and Distinctions

- Students finish completing the note-catcher for chapter 1 as needed.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread chapter 2 (pages 9–20) of *Farewell to Manzanar* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.
