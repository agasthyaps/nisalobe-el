5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

RI.8.3

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

He was suddenly a man with no rights **who looked exactly like the enemy.** (from page 7 of *Farewell to Manzanar* by Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston and James D. Houston)

**Lesson 2 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after Work Time B.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target (**I can analyze how the authors make connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in *Farewell to Manzanar****)* and RI.8.3 by providing an example of how an author makes connections between individuals using comparison.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses a simile (**like the enemy**) within a relative clause (**who looked exactly like the enemy**) with the purpose of describing Papa and comparing him to the enemy.

- Transfer: **who** + verb + **like** + object when interpreting descriptions of individuals and events on the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment and to provide description during the collaborative discussion in the End of Unit 1 Assessment.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **He was suddenly a man with no rights <u>who looked exactly like the enemy.</u>**

- Ask:

“What is this sentence about?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **who looked exactly like the enemy**.

- Ask:

“Whom is this chunk describing?” (Papa)

“Can you figure out which noun phrase in this sentence the relative pronoun who is replacing?” (It is replacing a man with no rights, which in this sentence refers to Papa.)

- As needed, briefly review basic information about relative clauses (Relative clauses describe the noun or noun phrase that they follow. Relative clauses usually begin with **that**, **which**, **who**, or **where**, and these words replace the subject of the clause, which is the noun or noun phrase that comes directly before the relative clause.)

- For heavier support, display two sentences to help students see how the relative clause has been formed:

> **He was suddenly a man with no rights.**
>
> **The man with no rights looked exactly like the enemy.**

“Why do you think the authors used a relative clause to provide this description?”  
(To make their writing more concise. They could have used two sentences to provide the same information, but it would be choppy and harder to read.)

“Can you find the simile in this chunk? How do you know?” (The simile is like the enemy. The word like helps us identify this.)

“Who is the enemy that Papa is being compared to?” (The Japanese. During World War II, the United States was fighting with Japan.)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **He was suddenly a man with no rights <u>who looked exactly like the enemy.</u>**

- Ask:

“What if we move the relative clause who looked exactly like the enemy somewhere else in the sentence?” (It would be grammatical to move the relative clause after he, because who, the noun he, and the noun phrase the man with no rights all refer to Papa, but the purpose of the relative clause is to give us more information specifically about why Papa was a man with no rights. A relative clause must follow the noun or noun phrase it describes.)

“How does this sentence help us understand the causes of Japanese American internment?” (Responses will vary, but should include that the authors compare Papa to the enemy to help the reader understand the historical context and the Japanese American experience. Japanese Americans, because of the heritage and appearance, were often viewed as enemies to the United States during World War II. This led the government to eventually send them to camps like Manzanar.)

“How can we use description and similes in our speaking or writing?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all replies.)

- Ask:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target:  
I can analyze how the authors make connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in Farewell to Manzanar?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is someone \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
>
> noun **who** + verb + **like** + noun

- Say:

“Use this frame to describe someone using a relative clause with a simile inside of it. This can be a friend, a family member, a celebrity, or someone else you know.”

- Responses will vary, but may include:

> **<u>My sister</u>** is someone **<u>who swims like a fish</u>**.
>
> noun **who** + verb + **like** + noun
