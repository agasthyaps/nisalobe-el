**“Surviving Poston’s Desert Heat: Cellars, Fans, Ponds, and Gardens”**

by Roy Kakuda

We arrived in Poston (Colorado River Relocation Center) in May of 1942. Everyone was told that the air temperature would rise above 115 deg. F. in the summer. The water system was not fully functional, and the canals to bring water for agriculture were in the process of construction. Many decided that a cellar would be cooler than the black tarpaper barracks. The soil was soft and dusty which required the cellar walls to be reenforced. Only a few inmates could gather enough material to make a cellar deeper than three to four feet.

The other cooling option was to make or buy a swamp cooler but that required materials or money for a home swamp cooler and a supply of cooling water. Our barrack (Block 38 Barrack 2) was composed of the Kakuda, Aoyama, and Yamamoto families. We decided to dig cellars until water became available. We dug 3 to 4 foot pits under our barracks and used the 18 inch gap between the ground and the barrack to crawl in and out of the cellar. I remember taking naps in our and the nursery school cellars during the heat of the day. The ground was so dusty that when you crawled in or out the cellar or when the wind blew you were covered in dust.

When the heat of the day became bearable we would slip on our homemade getas (elevated wooden shoes) and happi coats (Japanese light-weight robe) and go to the shower room to cool off in the showers and wash off the dirt. So many people were digging cellars that the piles of dirt from the cellar construction became a problem. It was decided to make a large dirt pile near the camp front gate. The pile became so large that to me, a child of 3 year, that it became a huge mountain. To beautify the mountain it was turned into a Japanese garden. The garden was later used by many as a place to take photos.

As water became more available, the inmates began to make the equivalent of swamp coolers by passing air through a wet material using an electric fan. This moisted air would cool the barracks by evaporation unless we were in the monsoon season where the atmosphere was already moisted. Then the swamp coolers were ineffective. I remember jostling with my siblings for a breath of the cool moistened air. The swamp coolers required a constant stream of water so the inmates added water pipes to the barrack faucets. The pipe that fed the damp material had holes spaced to evenly wet the material. You can see the water stain on the barrack walls in the photos below.

Poston was lucky because we had the Colorado River as a water supply. Water wells drawing water from the river supplied the water needs for swamp coolers, trees, and gardens. Our sister camp at Gila River initially had swamp coolers but they were removed because of Hila River’s water shortage.

When my father was se\[n\]t to Idaho as a farm labor\[er\] he earned enough money to buy a mail order swamp cooler. It was more than a month’s salary if he worked in the camp. As a cook in the camp he earned only \$16 per month. In Idaho he earned more than \$160 per month. Because my father earned a living salary outside of the camp, when he came back to the Poston, he refused to work in the camp for \$16 per month so he had to pay a fee to live in the camp he was not permitted to leave.

Instead, he and his neighbors landscaped our yards by building koi ponds, planting trees, and creating cooling pathways. Poston was still stifling hot in the summer, a dust storm in the wind, and freezing cold in the winter but it became more of a home.

**“Life in the Camp”**

by Norman Mineta, from an interview by Duff Griffith for the Japanese American Project of the Oral History Program at California State University, Fullerton

Heart Mountain was the largest of the relocation camps, with about 10,000 people living there. We lived in barracks, and each family had a room about 15 wide by 20 five feet long. This would house a family of anywhere from four to seven people. This was your living room and bedroom. Each one had a potbelly stove for warmth, one light, and an army cot for each person. Everything was right in this one room. I would say that the length was alright, but width-wise, it was a little narrow. Because our living space was so small, we were closely supervised as kids.

To use the bathroom, we went to the shared latrines. To eat, we went to the mess hall.

We ate as a family, but not in our room. We had meal tickets that corresponded to a mess hall—the yellow mess, the red mess, or the blue mess—and you would come through the line and the mess steward would punch your ticket for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.

We also had a governmental structure in camp where each block would have a block council, and the block council would then elect a block manager. My dad was block manager.

We had some flare-ups in Heart Mountain, but nothing like the riot. Once a rock was thrown through our barrack’s window. This was because some people did not agree with my family’s beliefs. My brother-in-law was very active in the Japanese American Citizen’s League (JACL). JACL decided in the beginning of the war to cooperate with the U.S. government because that would prove our American patriotism. JACL was going to cooperate fully with the authorities in making sure that the relocation went off as smoothly as possible. Other Japanese Americans did not believe that we should cooperate with the American government because the camps were unconstitutional, and they knew that my brother-in-law was the executive director of the JACL. I think it was those people who objected to the JACL’s position who threw the rocks and broke two of our windows.

**Introduction and First Letter to Clara Breed**

by Louise Ogawa

Clara Estelle Breed, also known as “Miss Breed,” was the children’s librarian at the San Diego Public Library from 1929 to 1945. Miss Breed was fond of all children, including the many Japanese American children and teenagers who used to frequent the East San Diego branch library where she worked. Before World War II, Miss Breed was a mentor to many Nisei children who visited the library.

As the United States entered the war, these young Nisei were removed from their homes and placed in concentration camps. Shocked and outraged, Miss Breed helped her young friends by becoming a lifeline to the outside world. She handed out stamped and addressed postcards at the railroad station on the day of their departure and encouraged them to write.

Upon receiving their letters, Miss Breed responded with books, care packages, and immeasurable emotional support. Yet, her commitment to her Japanese American friends did not end with the letters and packages she regularly sent. Recognizing the injustice that the United States had committed against the Japanese American community and seeing the need for others to speak out on their behalf, Miss Breed wrote various articles about the internment both during and after the war. Her actions, like those of the many people who reached out and helped Japanese Americans during this time, were all the more remarkable because of the widespread fear and hatred that was associated with anything Japanese.

After the war, Japanese Americans were allowed to return to their homes on the West Coast. Although Miss Breed no longer worked at the Children’s Library, having been appointed to the position of Head Librarian in 1945, she continued to exchange letters with many of her Japanese American friends until her death at the age of 88 in 1994. She is remembered by all of her correspondents, now in their 60s and 70s, as a woman who restored their faith in themselves and in others during a time when this faith was sorely tested.

November 30, 1942

Dear Miss Breed,

Since I did not do any house moving in Santa Anita, I’m doing double duty here. I’ve moved again. This time I hope it will be permanent. My new address is now: Blk 328 -11- A.

Since 6 weeks of school life in camp has become similar to the life in San Diego. We now have a school paper. At the present there is a contest going on in submitting names for the school. The winning title will receive a year’s subscription to Life Magazine.

Friday, Nov. 27th, I enjoyed the movie, How Green Was My Valley. With it I saw a news reel about the sailors in training in San Diego. When I saw Balboa Park and the Naval Training Station, I became too homesick for words. All the former San Diegans began to clap and hurrah as soon as they saw a glimpse of our hometown.

I hope you had a nice Thanksgiving, even though the world is in such a turmoil. We had a wonderful Thanksgiving. The mess hall was beautifully decorated with artificial flowers. On the sides of each table was a vase of flowers and in the center was a spray of fresh fruits on fresh green leaves. We had turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, mince pie, peas, potatoes, fruit salad and a choice of fresh fruits. The whole block consisting of about 350 people sat before the beautifully decorated table, gave their thanks and ate together—recalling the happy moments of the past and hoping for a brighter future. It was a wonderful meal!! I never expected to have such a nice Thanksgiving dinner this year. This year there certainly was more things to be thankful for—at least for me there is.

The boys who went out to work on the sugar beets in Colorado came home just in time to enjoy the Thanksgiving dinner with their families. All the boys who went out to work—Idaho, Colorado, Nebraska, Wyoming—are all back home now in good health. But there is still a few boys out working in Oregon. They transferred from Idaho to Oregon.

A friend who returned from Colorado related the following incident to me. He said, while in town a few boys entered a restaurant to have a bite to eat. The first thing the waitress asked was “Are you Japs?” When they replied “yes” she turned her back on them and said they don’t serve Japs. So they had to go to another restaurant to eat. Here is another incident which disgusted the boys. When the boys asked a policeman where a certain store was he replied—  
“I don’t serve Japs.” One of the boys became angry and remarked— “Alright be that way—what do you think we came out here for? We didn’t come to be made fun of—we came to help out in this labor shortage.” Then the policeman apologized and showed them to the store. This boy said he certainly was glad to return to camp where there is no unfriendliness. Of course, he knows and we all know that there are people all over the world who hate certain races and they just can’t help it. But I am sure when this war is over there will be no racial discrimination and we won’t have to doubt for a minute the great principles of democracy.

One discouraging thing which occurred here is the building of the fence. Now there is a fence all around this camp. I hope very soon this fence will be torn down. I always seem to rattle on and on about myself. Three pages is enough for me, I think. Pretty soon I will be writing a autobiography.

I do hope you are just fine and I can just see you scurrying around the library without a moment of rest. How is everything? Please don’t over work yourself and please be careful of your health for these wintery days are so cold.

Most sincerely,

Louise Ogawa

Please do write during your leisure time.

January 6, 1942

Dear Miss Breed,

I received the sweater and my brother’s shorts. Thank you very very much for going through so much trouble for me. You need not have hurried in buying them. I wish you had shopped during your leisure time. Thank you again. The shorts are just fine. They fit perfectly. My sweater is excellent. I just love it!!! I am sorry I did not mention the price. Hearing that sweaters have gone up I did not write the price. No, you need not worry about the cost because I intended to pay about that much.

I was very glad to hear you liked the flowers. I wish I could have sent 10 dozen Am. beauty roses (real ones) to show my appreciation for everything you have done for me.

In my last letter I said the fence was torn down—well, it is up again. This time a few feet further out. We have been told that the reason for the fence building was so the cattle won’t come near our homes. In other words cattle is going to be grazed outside the fence. But as yet, we have not seen any. Yes, I think the fence tends to weaken the morale of the people.

New Years I attended the New Year Festival which was held in Camp II. It was held 3 days, Jan 1st, 2nd, and 3rd. There were various exhibits. The Camp II Industry exhibit—displayed various kinds of things made by the department. Education was very interesting too. There the works of the school children were displayed. Agriculture was another. In this building were many different kinds of vegetation. They were very green and looked as fresh as a daisy. The one I enjoyed most was the Arts and Crafts. The longest line was in front of this building. My girl friend and I actually waited half an hour in line. It was worth the waiting time, I thought. Men have gone to cut mesquite trees and have made lovely flower vases out of them. The crooked branches and the bumpiest ones make the prettiest vases. In the vases there were many varieties of artificial flowers. Many beautiful cases were made too. Such things as ash trays, book ends, pencil holders, fruit baskets, vases, little jewelry chests, and crochet and checker sets were made out of mesquite.

When we saw the rolls and rolls of beautiful artificial flowers—chrysanthemums—in a green house, after standing in the hot sun, it gave us a refreshing feeling. I wish you could have been there.

We had our annual “mochi tsuki”; making rice cakes. Our parents were very happy to be able to eat “mochi” again. No one ever dreamed of eating them again. The govt. is very good to us and I am truly grateful.

We now have oil stoves in our homes and school. But it does little good because you have to be near the stove in order to receive any heat. By keeping all the windows closed the room may become warm, but we were warned against it. Several people have been sent to the hospital because they did not leave any windows open—they inhaled the fume which comes out of the stove. In school the stove is in one corner and I am in the opposite corner so the warmth does not come near me. It certainly took a long time to get the stoves because of too much red tape involved. We still have no books to study out of. We are taught the progressive way. It is like a lecture form. The teacher talks and we take notes. When test time comes we have to study our notes. I hope by next semester we will be able to study from books.

I have been having trouble about my credits because we did not get credit for the last semesters work. I am lacking 1/2 credit for graduation this June. But with the help of our Vice principal, Mr. Tashiro, I will be able to graduate.

We now have a school constitution. A student from each Case Studies class (history and English classes) formed the Constitutional Convention. At the present time it is being ratified. Next week we are going to have election of Student Body officers.

This morning we had an assembly at which time we had the opportunity to hear Mr. Head, project director; Mr. Popkins, construction director and Dr. Casey, Education. Mr. Popkins showed us the plans of building a new school. He stated that Japanese-American architects drafted the plans. The building is to be made out of adobe. The adobe bricks are going to be made here.

The movie for this Friday night is “Confirm or Deny” I am very anxious to see it.

As a Christmas gift we, the students of Poston III High School, received \$500.00 from the McKinley High School of Honolulu—this is to buy athletic equipments. Dr. Casey, who is our Superintendent of Schools in Poston is a former principal of McKinley High School.

Now, I must answer your questions before I forget about them. Yes, many varieties of X’mas cards were made here in Poston. I do not know who the artist is that made the card I selected. I wish I knew. There is no art school here. Yes, there is a famous artist here in Poston. I do not know much about him. The little I know of him is—his name is Mr. Isamu Noguchi, a famous sculptor. He has gone to New York on a short “furlough.” He expects to return in a few months.

As time marches on, more and more Poston seems like a home to me. After leaving home for a visit to Camp 1 or 2, it certainly feels good to be home again. No longer is the thought of being in a camp afloat in my mind. But every time I see the fence, it seems like a dark cloud has lifted and a realization of camp life comes before my eyes. Often I use to think as I laid on my pillow, What will happen to be if I had to live in this camp for 5 year?” but now, I don’t seem to think about camp. I guess I have adopted myself to this situation. But many a time, I have wished with all my heart that I could go back to San Diego.

Yes, we can hear conversation through the partition. We can hear every word our neighbor is saying.

The apt. is divided into 4 units. There is no closet or chest of drawers to keep our clothes in. Father made a closet to put our clothes in. We keep just the necessary amount hung in the closet. The rest is still packed in our suitcases.

Yes, the food shortage has affected us. We have had no butter or egg for about two months. We have enough meat, though. Just tonite we had steak, mash potato, spinach and rice for supper. Oh yes, about the menu for a week. I am sorry I did not send it to you. To be honest—it slipped my mind. But this time I shall be sure to keep the menu for a week and send it to you just as soon as a week is up. We are allowed 1 tablespoon of sugar to 1 cup of coffee. We eat rice only once a day now. We have fresh milk. It comes all the way from California. We have tea too but it is black. Yes, Mr. Anderson does wear a wig. Margaret noticed today that he has no eyebrows. Could this be possible?

The school paper is published once a week.

I certainly was surprised to hear of the film shortage. I don’t blame you for wanting to take a picture of a 8 month old baby. I imagine he or she is very cute. I certainly wish we were allowed to have cameras. I’d like to snap our living quarters, school etc. It will be such a nice souvenir and a good remembrance.

Miss Breed, do you know if shower caps are on the shortage list too?

I would very much like to have:

2 hole note-book paper lined—2 pkg. or 1

1 eraser

1 little pencil sharpener like the ones in a pencil box.

Please do not rush this because I am not in a hurry. Please remember your work comes before my shopping!

Thank you!

Please do write during your leisure time and let me know how everything is with you.

As I count the pages, I have written 4 pages. I never realized how much I was writing. I imagine by the time you finish the 2nd page, you’ll become hungry.

Most sincerely,

Louise Ogawa
