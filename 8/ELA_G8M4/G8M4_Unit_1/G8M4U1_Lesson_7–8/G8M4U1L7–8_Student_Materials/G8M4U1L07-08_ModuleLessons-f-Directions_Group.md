1.  Form groups of four, and number yourselves 1–4.

2.  Gather a set of four different-colored markers, a response chart, texts, and loose-leaf paper. Each member of the group chooses a color and uses it for the duration of the activity.

3.  Examine the mystery text, and individually annotate and text code it as you work to determine the topic and any important information from the mystery text.

4.  Discuss the topic and important information from the mystery text with your small group. Then, in the outer box of the response chart, student 1 records the group’s ideas in the space labeled “Student 1,” drafting on loose-leaf paper as necessary.

5.  Individually read or examine the common text, annotating and text coding, marking **N** on any new information you learn.

6.  Discuss with your small group the new information you learned from the common text. Then in the second box of the response chart, student 2 records the group’s ideas in the space labeled “Student 2,” drafting on loose-leaf paper as necessary.

7.  Distribute one expert text from the expert text folder to each member of your group.

8.  Individually read or examine your expert text, annotating, text coding, and marking **N** on any new information you learn. You may want to take notes on loose-leaf paper as well.

9.  Share with your small group the new information you learned from your expert text. Once all members have shared their expert text, student 3 records a summary of all the new information learned from the expert texts in the space labeled “Student 3,” drafting on loose-leaf paper as necessary.

10. Finally, in the middle box of the response chart, student 4 creates a graphic illustration of all the group’s learning on the topic in the space labeled “Student 4,” drafting on loose-leaf paper as necessary.
