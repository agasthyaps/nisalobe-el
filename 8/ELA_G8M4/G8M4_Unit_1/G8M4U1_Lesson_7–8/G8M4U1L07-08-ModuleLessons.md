Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.8.1 – Opening A: On an entrance ticket, students analyze a photograph from a Japanese American internment camp, citing several pieces of evidence to support analysis of the image.

- RL.8.1 – Work Time A: Students use evidence from informational texts to build background knowledge on other Japanese American internment experiences.

- RI.8.1 – Work Time A: Students use evidence from literary texts to build background knowledge on other Japanese American internment experiences.

- RI.8.1 – Closing and Assessment A: In a Chalk Talk protocol, students examine their classmates’ informational text syntheses about other Japanese American internment experiences.

- In this lesson, students focus on becoming effective learners by persevering through challenging texts, collaborating with group-mates on a chart paper representation of learning, and taking initiative with roles in the group.

- The Think-Pair-Share, Building Background Knowledge, and Chalk Talk protocols are used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning. Students engage in the following new protocol in this lesson (instructions for which appear at the first point of use in the lesson and in the Classroom Protocols document located on the Tools page \[http://eled.org/tools\]):

- **Building** **Background** **Knowledge** demonstrates how quickly people can become interested in a topic, build background knowledge, and use that knowledge to become better and more informed readers of complex text. The protocol adapts easily to content in many disciplines, and the design ensures that all students read, think, and contribute. The protocol is particularly useful in introducing a topic because it fosters curiosity and builds in immediate feedback about learning.

- **Chalk** **Talk** is a written protocol in which students respond in writing, in a central place (such as a piece of chart paper), to an important, open-ended question—silently. It is a way to promote discussion and awareness of issues, perspectives, or academic challenges. Chalk Talks bypass the social roadblocks that often impede classroom communication and ensure that all voices are heard. A Chalk Talk is also an excellent way to promote awareness of patterns and problems, as students reflect on the information they have shared.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release more responsibility more quickly to students as they comprehend the tasks or concepts. For example, if students are familiar with the Building Background Knowledge protocol or they quickly understand the directions for the protocol, release them to complete the steps at their own pace.

- Also, extend learning by asking students to model tasks:

- Allow those students who have historical background knowledge of other Japanese American internment experiences to create their own informational texts for use in future classes for this activity.

- Allow students who have skills with image analysis to model image analysis and/or lead discussions with the class or a small group about their notices and wonders with regard to the photograph in this lesson.

- During the Building Background Knowledge activity, assign the expert text “Introduction and Letters to Clara Breed” to students ready for a reading challenge.

- Encourage students to express what they have learned from their independent research reading using multimodalities. Students could create a collage, podcast, poem, or game to synthesize their learning.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students have focused on analyzing how the text and film of *Farewell to Manzanar* develop ideas, individuals, and events. In this lesson, students learn about other Japanese American internment experiences with similarities and differences to those portrayed in the anchor text.

Support All Students

- At this point, students should be reading the texts independently. However, if some or all students need more support, read several paragraphs aloud and release students to read independently, in pairs, or in small groups. ▲

- Students may be overwhelmed by the number of texts and steps in the Building Background Knowledge protocol. If so, distribute one text at a time, and ensure students understand the task for that text. ▲

- Some students may have an easier time reading shorter texts. During the expert texts portion of Building Background Knowledge protocol, ensure that these students work with either “Surviving Poston’s Desert Heat: Cellars, Fans, Ponds, and Gardens” or “Life in the Camp.” ▲

- The subject matter in the texts in this lesson includes descriptions of incidents of racism as well as inhumane conditions in the internment camps. Continue to monitor students to determine if issues surface from the content of these texts that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually. To support students in processing this content, ask: “What habit of character did you use as you read and discussed these texts?” Students may need to draw on perseverance, empathy, and compassion as they read and discuss this content, being sensitive to their own and others’ reactions to the information presented.

- To support ELLs, this lesson features two protocols: Building Background Knowledge and Chalk Talk. During the Building Background Knowledge protocol, students explore a set of complex informational texts to learn about other Japanese American internment experiences with similarities to and differences from those portrayed in *Farewell to Manzanar*. In the Chalk Talk protocol, students respond to the readings silently and then share their responses with the class. This supports ELLs in expressing themselves in an equitable way that bypasses some of the challenges associated with exchanging information orally.

- ELLs may find it challenging to navigate the informational texts during the Building Background Knowledge protocol. Consider having ELLs focus on the shorter texts available to make the task as accessible as possible. During Chalk Talk, some ELLs may find it difficult to capture their thinking in writing without first processing orally. Provide an opportunity for those students who benefit to discuss their responses before beginning the formal protocol.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.A.1, 8.I.B.6, and 8.I.B.7

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ response charts regarding what students know, what they have learned, and their new learning.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will return to the anchor text *Farewell to Manzanar* to continue analyzing the experiences of the Wakatsuki family.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Assign students to groups, with four per group.

- For each group, prepare a set of four different-colored markers, a piece of chart paper, loose-leaf paper, and the following texts:

- Mystery text: “In Response to Executive Order 9066” by Dwight Okita (one per student)

- Common text: “Japanese Relocation during World War II” from the *National Archives* (one per student)

- Expert texts (one folder per student group, with one copy of each of the following per folder): “Surviving Poston’s Desert Heat: Cellars, Fans, Ponds, and Gardens” by Roy Kakua, “Life in the Camp” by *Scholastic*, “Introduction and Letter from Louise Ogawa, November 30, 1942” by Louise Ogawa, and “Introduction and Letter from Louise Ogawa, January 6, 1942” by Louise Ogawa)

- On chart paper, create a response chart for each group. Draw a box to create a fairly wide frame for the poster. Draw a smaller box inside the first. The boxes will create three spaces for representing learning. To see a sample chart, refer to the Building Background Knowledge Response Chart.

- Prepare a research reading share using the Independent Reading Sample Plans document (see the Tools page: http://eled.org/tools) or use another independent reading routine for students to reflect on and share what they have learned about the module topic from their independent work.

- Ensure there is a copy of Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lessons 7–8 at each student’s workspace.

- Review the Building Background Knowledge protocol directions in preparation for leading the activity.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous modules to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.8.1 (10 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **1**, **Lessons** **7** – **8**.

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique to review their responses. Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What do we learn about people’s experiences in other internment camps from this photo?” (We learn that some people worked on government or military projects for the war.)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Build Background Knowledge – RI.8.1 (45 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can draw inferences using evidence from texts to build background knowledge about other Japanese American internment experiences.”

- Inform students that today they will participate in a new protocol, called Building Background Knowledge. Remind students that they may have experienced this protocol in previous years. Explain that this is an excellent protocol for working together to build knowledge about other Japanese American internment experiences.

- Ask students to form groups of four and number themselves 1–4. As they do so, distribute to each group a **set** **of** **four** **different** - **colored** **markers**, **a** **piece** **of** **chart** **paper**, **Mystery** **and** **Common** **Texts**, **Expert** **Texts** **folders**, ***Farewell to Manzanar***, **loose** - **leaf** **paper**, and **response** **chart**. Ask students to each choose a marker that they will use for the duration of the protocol. Remind students that they will be collaborating in groups, so they should keep in mind the discussion norms by referring to the **Discussion** **Norms** **anchor** **chart**.

- Distribute the **Building** **Background** **Knowledge** **Protocol**. Review items 1–4 of the directions with students, explaining that in the Building Background Knowledge protocol, they will first examine a mystery text in their groups, individually taking notes, annotating, and coding the text. Explain that students may want to take notes about the mystery text on a piece of loose-leaf paper. Next, they will discuss the mystery text in their group and the student who is numbered 1 will record bullets or a web of notes in the outer box on the group’s response chart that shows the group’s understanding of the text. As necessary, display the mystery text and model or ask volunteers to model annotating and coding a portion of the text. ▲ Release students to individually examine, annotate, text code, and take notes on the mystery text.

- After several minutes, ask students to share their annotations and notes with their groups as student 1 records his or her ideas in bullets or a web in the outer box on the group’s response chart, drafting on loose-leaf paper as needed. If necessary, display a piece of chart paper and model recording some notes, or ask volunteers to do so in order to support students’ understanding of the task. ▲

- Once each student 1 has recorded his or her group’s understanding of the mystery text, discuss it as a class. Ensure that students understand that although the poem was written by a man, the speaker is a young girl. Ask students to Think-Group-Share:

“To whom is the speaker writing? How do you know? What is Executive Order 9066? Review page xiv of *Farewell to Manzanar* as necessary.” (She is speaking to the US government that issues Executive Order 9066, which allowed the government to remove people of Japanese descent from their homes and intern them in camps.)

“Why does she say that she has ‘always felt funny using chopsticks’ and her favorite food is hotdogs?” (She wants to show the US government that she is American.)

“What happens between her and her best friend Denise?” (Denise accuses her of being a traitor.)

“How does this experience compare to experiences Jeanne described in *Farewell to Manzanar*?” (Like the speaker, Jeanne experienced racist and unjust accusations of being a traitor after she got out of camp—a woman called her and Kiyo “dirty Japs” and told them to “go back to Japan” \[168\].)

“What does this similarity suggest about the experiences of many Japanese Americans before and after the war?” (Many Japanese Americans experienced racism and unjust accusations before and after the war.)

- Review items 5–6 of the Building Background Knowledge protocol. Ensure that students understand that they will each examine a common text, individually taking notes, annotating, and text coding it, paying specific attention to any new information they learn and marking it with an *N*. Explain to students that they may want to take notes about the common text on a piece of loose-leaf paper. As necessary, display the common text, and model or ask volunteers to model annotating and coding a portion of the text. ▲ Release students to individually read, annotate, code, and take notes on the common text.

- After several minutes, ask students to share their annotations and notes with their groups as student 2 records his or her ideas in bullets or a web in the second box on the group’s response chart, drafting on loose-leaf paper as needed. If necessary, display a piece of chart paper and model recording some notes, or ask volunteers to do so in order to support students’ understanding of the task. ▲

- Review items 7–10 of the Building Background Knowledge directions. Ensure that students understand that each member of the group will now examine a different expert text, individually taking notes, annotating, and text coding it, marking *N* on any new information they learn. Explain to students that they may want to take notes about their expert text on a piece of loose-leaf paper. Release groups to distribute an expert text to each member of their group. Students can individually read or examine, annotate, and take notes on their expert text.

- After several minutes, ask students to share the new information they learned from their expert text with their groups. Once all members have shared their expert text, student 3 records a summary of all the new information learned from the expert texts in the middle box of the response chart, drafting on loose leaf paper as needed. Model as necessary, or ask volunteers to do so to support students’ understanding of the task. Students can use the model sentences as frames if needed.▲

- Finally, direct student 4 of each group to create a graphic illustration of all the group’s learning on the topic in the middle box of the response chart, drafting on loose-leaf paper as necessary.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time A, before students read the common text, remind them to pause after reading each paragraph to jot down a gist. If they are unable to understand a paragraph enough to record a gist, they should Turn and Talk with a partner to figure out the gist of the paragraph together. Taking time to record gists will support comprehension.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time A, to support students in reading the common text, draw together a group of students who need heavier support and read aloud the common text, pausing at the end of each paragraph for students to Turn and Talk to tell the gist, highlight keywords and phrases, and even illustrate the text in the margins. Review students’ gists, highlights, and illustrations before moving on to the next paragraph. Taking time to record gists and highlight the text will ensure comprehension.

- In Work Time A, to gradually release responsibility in the expert text portion of the protocol, encourage students to join with their peers who have the same expert text to read or examine and discuss their text together before sharing with their groups. Circulate to ensure students understand and can speak about their texts. As necessary, provide the following sentence frames for students to practice in pairs and then use with their groups:

- My expert text was about . . .

- From the text, I learned . . .

Closing and Assessment

A. Chalk Talk – RI.8.1 (10 minutes)

- Post each group’s response chart on the wall. Also, near the chart paper, post the **Chalk** **Talk** **Directions** **and** **Norms**. Read aloud the Directions and Norms, modeling each step on the board for students who need more visual support. ▲ Remind students to leave substantive, thoughtful sticky notes that go beyond “good job.” Invite students to model exemplary sticky notes before beginning the Chalk Talk.

- Release students to begin the Chalk Talk, ensuring that students respond to at least one of the posted questions at every station they visit in the allotted amount of time. Ask students to study one another’s response charts, noticing similarities and differences. Invite students to record compliments, similarities, and differences on **sticky notes** beside students’ response charts and respond to one another’s sticky notes.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- To ensure students can fully participate in the Chalk Talk protocol, draw them together in a group and provide sentence frames they can use on their sticky notes:

- Yes! I also learned that . . .

- It is a good connection because . . .

- Wow! This surprises me because . . .

- On this part I wonder . . .

Closing and Assessment

B. Share Independent Research Reading – RL.8.10, RI.8.10 (15 minutes)

- Remind students that the purpose of research reading is to build their content knowledge on the topic so many of the ideas and domain-specific vocabulary words become familiar. This makes complex texts easier to read and understand. Remind students that they are expected to read independently for 20 minutes each day for homework, logging their reading and choosing and responding to a prompt in their independent reading journals.

- Explain that when a person is honest and follows through tasks like homework, this demonstrates integrity. Consult the **Work** **to** **Become** **Ethical** **People** **anchor** **chart** to review *integrity* as necessary.

- Refer to the **Independent** **Reading** **Sample** **Plans** located on the Tools page (http://eled.org/tools) to guide students through a research reading share, or use another routine.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. QuickWrite about Other Internment Experiences

- Students complete **Homework**: **QuickWrite** **about** **Other** **Internment** **Experiences** to write about how one of the texts read in these lessons relates to the experiences or events in *Farewell to Manzanar*.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread chapter 7 (pages 54–58) of *Farewell to Manzanar* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.
