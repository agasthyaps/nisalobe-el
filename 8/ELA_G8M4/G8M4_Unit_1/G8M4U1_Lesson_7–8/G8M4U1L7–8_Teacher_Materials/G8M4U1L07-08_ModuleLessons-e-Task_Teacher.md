(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Draw boxes on chart paper as shown in the diagram below to create one response chart for each group. Then students will record key details from their group’s discussion of the mystery text (student 1), the common text (student 2), the expert texts (student 3), and all the texts (student 4). Possible student responses follow the diagram.
