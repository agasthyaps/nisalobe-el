Chalk Talk Directions and Norms

SL.8.1, SL.8.5

**Chalk Talk Directions**

1.  Each participant individually moves through the stations with a different-colored pencil, marker, or pen and several sticky notes. If classroom supplies are limited, sign your name by your comments.

2.  Choose a station, move to that station, and read, listen to, or view the text. If three participants are already at that station, then make another choice and move to a different station.

3.  Each participant writes on the chart paper of that station, making at least one comment.

4.  Because this is a celebration of learning, provide positive, celebratory feedback.

5.  Once finished reading, listening, viewing and commenting, move silently to another station.

6.  Participants read, listen to, or view the new text and comment once again, repeating this step as many times as possible in the time allotted.

7.  When others have written comments on chart paper, participants search for patterns and themes. Participants jot down these noticings on a sticky note or put a star by a comment they’ve seen more than once. Participants should be prepared to share patterns and themes.

8.  At the conclusion of the Chalk Talk, participants share patterns and themes aloud with the whole class.
