Homework: QuickWrite about Other  
Internment Experiences

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** QuickWrite about how one of the texts read in these lessons relates to the experiences or events in *Farewell to Manzanar*.

Responses will vary but may include: The text “Surviving Poston’s Desert Heat: Cellars, Fans, Ponds, and Gardens” relates to *Farewell to Manzanar* because it shows how unlivable the conditions were in the camps. In the article, the author relates how he and the other internees at Poston were overwhelmed by the extreme heat. The summer in the desert was so hot and the camp facilities were so inadequate that internees had to dig cellars underneath their barracks and lie in them to escape the heat. They also had to build their own swamp coolers, which they paid for themselves and were expensive. The authors of *Farewell to Manzanar* focus more on the disgusting latrines as well as the dust and cold which flowed into the poorly built barracks at Manzanar. However, both texts emphasize the unlivable conditions of the camps.
