“At work on camouflage nets at the Japanese internment camp in Santa Anita, California.” Photograph. 1942. *Library of Congress*. Web. Public domain.

Read the caption. What do you see? What do you wonder?

I see people (men) working on a big net. They seem to be weaving it by hand. The caption tells me that the net is a camouflage net. I wonder if it is for war. The caption tells me that the people are at work at a Japanese American internment camp in Santa Anita, California, so I know that this takes place in another camp like Manzanar.

What do you think is happening in this scene?

Prisoners of Japanese descent are working while imprisoned at a camp in Santa Anita, California. They are making a camouflage net, probably for use in World War II.
