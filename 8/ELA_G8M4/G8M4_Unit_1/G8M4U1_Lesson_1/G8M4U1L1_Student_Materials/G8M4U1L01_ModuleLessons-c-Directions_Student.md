3.  When you hear the teacher play music, move around the classroom with your partner and swap resources with other pairs. Continue swapping resources with new pairs as the music plays. When the music stops, you and your partner should have one new resource in your hands. If you have a resource you have seen previously, quickly and quietly swap it with a nearby pair.

4.  With your partner, repeat steps 2 and 3 until time is called.
