**Directions:** As you enter class, read the following excerpt from the foreword of *Farewell to Manzanar*. Then, answer the questions that follow.

When we first considered writing a book about the **internment** of Japanese Americans during World War Two, we told a New York writer friend about the idea. He said, “It’s a dead issue. These days you can hardly get people to read about a live issue. People are issued out.”

“I know it,” my husband said. “I’m issued out myself. The issue isn’t what we want to write about. Everybody knows an **injustice** was done. How many know what actually went on inside? If they think anything, they think concentration camps. But that conjures up Poland and Siberia. And these camps weren’t like that at all.” (ix)
