Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.8.4 – Opening A: On an entrance ticket, students determine the meaning of words and analyze the impact of specific word choices on meaning and tone.

- RI.8.4 – Work Time A: As they read chapters 3–4 of *Farewell to Manzanar*, students determine the meaning of words as they are used in the text.

- RI.8.3 – Work Time B: Students independently analyze how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- RI.8.3 – Closing and Assessment A: Students complete an exit ticket to assess their ability to analyze how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- RI.8.4 – Closing and Assessment A: Students complete an exit ticket to assess their ability to determine the meaning of words as they are used in the text.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become ethical people by showing respect and empathy as they reflect on the Wakatsuki family’s experiences and working to become effective learners by taking responsibility for their own learning as they work independently.

- In the chapter of *Farewell to Manzanar* read in this lesson, Woody demonstrates empathy and compassion for his family and perseverance as he works to improve their living conditions. Also, the old woman in the latrine shows compassion and empathy for Mama’s desire for privacy by loaning her the cardboard screen.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- As students read and learn more about the events involved in Japanese American internment in *Farewell to Manzanar*, invite students to research particular aspects of this time period that are of interest to them, such as other Japanese American internment experiences. Consider providing questions like the following to guide this exploration:

- Who were the key individuals involved? How are they connected? What distinctions are there between these individuals?

- What are the key ideas or events? How are these ideas or events connected? What distinctions are there between these ideas or events?

- Release more responsibility more quickly to students as they comprehend the tasks or concepts:

- Students who finish the entrance ticket quickly can read more of the Power of Words Handbook and share the main ideas and key details with their classmates.

- Allow those students who are able to read and identify gist independently to do so.

- An optional Mini Language Dive, intended for use after work with RI.8.3 in Work Time B, is available in Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students have focused on working as a class to analyze how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in *Farewell to Manzanar*. In this lesson, students continue practicing this analysis with independence in preparation for the assessment.

Support All Students

- Consider reading aloud the first several chapters of *Farewell to Manzanar* in these first lessons to ensure student comprehension, engagement, and enjoyment of the text. However, if all students are already engaged, determine how students will read chapters 3–4 of *Farewell to Manzanar* to best support their comprehension, or give students choice to build empowerment and engagement in learning. Alternatives to read-alouds include another fluent reader (including students or an audiobook) reads aloud to the whole class, small groups, triads, or pairs; individuals read silently; or a combination of any of these. Also as necessary, consider prehighlighting one or two key sentences in each subsection which articulate the gist.

- In chapters 3–4, there are descriptions of the poor conditions of the camp, including shack-like rooms, group dining, bathing, and bathroom facilities and the illnesses that result from these poor conditions. Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this chapter that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually. To support students in processing this content, ask: “What habit of character did you use as you read and discussed this excerpt?” Students may need to draw on perseverance, empathy, compassion as they read and discuss this content, being sensitive to their own and others’ reactions to the information presented.

- Also, in chapter 3, Jeanne’s brother uses the term *Japs* to describe the family. Explain to students that this is an offensive term that should not be used in class except when quoting the text.

- As in previous lessons, in Work Time A, present additional options for recording gist rather than just the sticky note, such as using a separate notebook, graphic organizer, using highlighters and annotating, or a voice recorder. Alternatively, give students options for expressing their understanding of gist (oral, written, or drawing). Also, build in different options for expressing comprehension of the text (written reflection, voice recording, or discussion with partners/groups). ▲

- When pairing students in Work Time B and in Closing and Assessment A, group ELLs with partners who have more advanced or home language proficiency. The partners with greater language proficiency can serve as a model, initiating discussions and providing implicit sentence frames, for example. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson follows a similar format to Lesson 2. Students continue to read *Farewell to Manzanar* and track connections and distinctions in the text using a note-catcher and engage in discussion about connections among and distinctions between ideas, individuals, or events in the text. This exchange provides an opportunity for ELLs to not only process content and engage in analysis but also to build oral skills.

- ELLs may find it challenging to navigate work with significant ideas during the Closing and Assessment of this lesson. Encourage ELLs to refer to gist notes and the Connections and Distinctions: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catcher, as needed. Discuss the concept of significant ideas in advance, and pair students strategically with supportive peers to help them confidently participate in discussion.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.A.1, 8.I.A.2, 8.I.B.6, and 8.II.A.1.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Connections and Distinctions note-catchers to ensure students understand how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in *Farewell to Manzanar*.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue to read and analyze *Farewell to Manzanar* in the mid-unit assessment, focusing on how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.8.4 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **1**, **Lesson** **5**. Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique to review their responses. Refer to **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **1**, **Lesson** **5** (**answers** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Explain to students that while these new terms are helpful in discussing and understanding the experience of Japanese Americans, the authors of *Farewell to Manzanar* chose to use the term *internment* and therefore that term is used in this module. Also, explain that throughout the module, students will read more about these terms and the diverse experiences and responses of Japanese Americans to internment. Additionally, explain that language is a living entity in many ways, and people’s changing understandings are often reflected in changing language. In Unit 3, as they read more contemporary texts, students will explore and use terms like *incarceration* and *forced* *removal* to discuss this period in history.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read *Farewell to Manzanar*, Chapters 3–4 – RI.8.4, L.8.4 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can determine the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary in chapters 3–4 of *Farewell to Manzanar*.”

- Repeated routine: Read chapters 3–4 in ***Farewell to Manzanar***. Use the **Text** **Guide**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** (**for** **teacher** **reference**) for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students who are ready to read independently or in small groups should be released to do so. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky** **notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary in their **vocabulary** **logs**, update the **Gist**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **anchor** **chart**, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Refer to the **Gist**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **anchor** **chart** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) and **Work** **to** **Become** **Ethical** **People** **anchor** **chart** as needed.

- If students do not finish reading the chapter within the allotted reading time, distribute **Synopsis**: ***Farewell to Manzanar,*** **Chapters** **3** – **4** to each student to review the key details from the chapter.

- Prompt students to Turn and Talk:

“What is the gist of chapters 3–4?” (On the first morning in Manzanar, Jeanne’s family wakes up covered in dust; Woody guides them to fix holes and cracks in their barrack. The camp is unlivable: buildings are unfinished, the clothes are too big and US army castoffs, the food is inedible, the bathrooms have poor or no plumbing and are not private.)

- With students’ support, record the meanings of *assert* (to state with force or confidence), *cubicle* (any very small room or partitioned space, as in an office or dormitory), *partitions* (a wall or partial wall that separates or divides space), *latrine* (a toilet for use by many, with or without plumbing, as in a camp or a military barracks), *subordinate* (make less important than), and *desolate* (without the things that are necessary or desirable for life; very lonely or without hope) on the **academic word** **wall** and **domain** - **specific** **word** **wall**, with translations in students’ home languages. Write synonyms or sketch a visual above the words to scaffold students’ understanding. Invite students to record these words in their vocabulary logs.

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What examples of habits of character were evident in this chapter?” (Responses will vary, but may mention how Woody demonstrates empathy and compassion for his family and perseverance as he works to improve their living conditions. Also, the old woman in the latrine shows compassion and empathy for Mama’s desire for privacy by loaning her the cardboard screen.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time A, to provide additional support with participle phrases after the optional Mini Language Dive, invite students to summarize the different ways in which - *ing* words can function in English (as verbs, nouns \[gerunds\], or adjectives). To help students continue to build linguistic knowledge of these forms, invite them to find examples from *Farewell to Manzanar* of each. Students can then explain whether the - *ing* word they have located is a participle, a gerund, or a verb and what clues within a sentence they used to make the determination.

Work Time

B. Analyze Connections and Distinctions: *Farewell to Manzanar*, Chapters 3–4 – RI.8.3 (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in *Farewell to Manzanar* to develop my understanding of the text.”

- Ask students to retrieve the **Connections** **and** **Distinctions**: ***Farewell to Manzanar* note** - **catcher**.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What is one success you are experiencing with the connections and distinctions analysis so far?” (Responses will vary, but may include: I can determine if something is a connection or a distinction; I can identify the methods used to convey it.)

“What is one challenge you are experiencing? What steps might you take to help you with that challenge?” (Responses will vary, but may include: I sometimes find it hard to know whether something is significant or not, or I have a hard time writing the explanations even though I know what I want to say; I can talk things through with my partner; I can reread the text; I can ask my partner questions.)

- Direct students to keep in mind their successes and challenges as they work with a new partner.

- Focus students on the chapters 3 and 4 table on the note-catcher. Point out that the distinctions and connections for these chapters are again provided in the note-catcher.

- Direct students to work with a partner to add in the methods for each of the listed distinctions and connections on the Connections and Distinctions: *Farewell to Manzanar* note-catcher. Remind them to use the **Authors’** **Methods** **anchor** **chart** as needed. Then direct them to discuss the explanation for the connection in chapter 3 (Woody’s/Papa’s personality) or the first connection in chapter 4 (military life/internment life). Then students can write the explanation. Pairs can choose or can be assigned the connection for the explanation.

- Using a total participation technique, such as **equity sticks**, call on a few pairs to share their initial thoughts. Refer to **Connections** **and** **Distinctions**: ***Farewell to Manzanar*** **note** - **catcher** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**). As students share, be sure to unpack methods, terms, and definitions as needed and add examples from chapter 3 for relevant methods used to the Authors’ Methods anchor chart. Refer to the **Authors’** **Methods** **anchor** **chart** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as necessary.

- Explain that in the next lesson, students will have the first of two assessments focused on connections and distinctions and how they help us understand the text. This first assessment will not include the explanation writing, but the one in Unit 2 will. Assure students that they will have more practice writing explanations and getting feedback before that time. The first assessment is composed of selected response and short constructed response items, similar to those on this lesson’s exit ticket.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time B, invite students to participate in a Mini Language Dive to explore how the authors compare Woody and Papa (RI.8.3). Building on the Language Dive in Lesson 3, this Mini Language Dive also gives students the opportunity for further work with L.8.1a, as it features a participle phrase functioning as an adjective.

Closing and Assessment

A. Exit Ticket – RI.8.3 (10 minutes)

- Distribute **Exit** **Ticket**: **Unit** **1**, **Lesson** **5**. Direct students to complete the questions. Collect and review the responses to check for understanding. Refer to **Exit** **Ticket**: **Unit** **1**, **Lesson** **5** (**answers** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- The last question on students’ exit tickets challenges students to name a significant idea about Mama that is conveyed through connections and distinctions in this chapter. Using a total participation technique, invite students to share the ideas they generated. As needed, use strategic combinations of Conversation Cues to help students expand and deepen their thinking.

“Can you say more about that?” (Goal 1)

“What in the text makes you think so?” (Goal 3)

“Who can add on to what your classmate said?” (Goal 4)

- Draw students’ attention to the **Significant** **Ideas** **anchor** **chart**. Add the following significant idea: Mama has a deep sense of personal dignity, which is threatened by the conditions at Manzanar.

- Ask:

“How do the authors convey this significant idea? You can refer to your note-catchers and exit tickets.” (Responses will vary, but may include: through distinctions between Mama’s and Woody’s attitudes to highlight Mama’s outrage at the conditions at Manzanar; through dialogue from Mama—“Animals live like this”; through descriptions of Mama reacting to the disgusting latrines.)

- Invite students to briefly revisit earlier chapters for other passages that convey this significant idea about Mama. If students are struggling to locate passages independently, invite them to work in pairs or triads to examine the passage from chapter 2, in which Mama is offered humiliatingly low prices by a dealer for a precious set of china (12–13). As students report ideas aloud, add relevant notes to the anchor chart. Refer to **Significant** **Ideas** **anchor** **chart** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- Invite students to share what their partners said to promote attentive listening, retelling, paraphrasing, and peer language modeling. Since students are accustomed to sharing out their own answer, explain why this is helpful and provide them with frames and a model first: “My partner (or name of student) said \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.”
