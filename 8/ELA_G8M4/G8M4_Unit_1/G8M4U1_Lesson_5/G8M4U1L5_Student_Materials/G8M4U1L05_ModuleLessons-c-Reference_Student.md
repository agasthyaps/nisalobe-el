**Chapter 4 “A Common Master Plan”**

- Jeanne and her family stand in line for 30 minutes for food at breakfast.

- Jeanne shares an observation that the camps were not ready for people to come live in them, and the people were not prepared to live in the camps. She describes things as being chaotic.

- Jeanne and her family get clothing from the War Department, but most of it is too big for them.

- Jeanne and others are constantly sick with stomach pains, first from the typhoid vaccine and then from rotten food.

- The bathrooms are crowded and dirty and offer no privacy. This embarrasses and frustrates Mama and others. The people in the camp feel insulted at the lack of privacy but feel powerless to do anything about it.
