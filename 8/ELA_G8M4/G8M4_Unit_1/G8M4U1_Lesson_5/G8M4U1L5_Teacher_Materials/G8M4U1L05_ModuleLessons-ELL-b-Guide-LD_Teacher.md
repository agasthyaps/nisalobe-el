5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

RI.8.3, L.8.1a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

He put his hands on his hips and gave Kiyo a sternly comic look, **squinting at him through one eye the way Papa would when he was asserting his authority.** (from page 23 of *Farewell to Manzanar* by Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston and James D. Houston)

**Lesson 5 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after Work Time B.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target (**I can analyze how the authors make connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in *Farewell to Manzanar****)* and RI.8.3 by providing an example of how an author makes connections between individuals using comparison and description. The sentence also helps to address L.7.1a, as it contains a participle adjective phrase (**squinting at him through one eye the way Papa would when he was asserting his authority**).

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses a participle phrase with the purpose of describing a point of comparison between two important individuals in *Farewell to Manzanar*, Woody and Papa.

- Transfer: **-ing** participle + prepositional phrase to interpret descriptions of individuals and events on the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment and to provide description during the collaborative discussion in the End of Unit 1 Assessment.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **He put his hands on his hips and gave Kiyo a sternly comic look, <u>squinting at him through one eye the way Papa would when he was asserting his authority.</u>**

- Ask:

“What is this sentence about?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **squinting at him through one eye the way Papa would when he was asserting his authority.**

- Ask:

“What do you notice about the language structure of this chunk?” (Responses will vary, but may include that it is a participle phrase.)

“Can you figure out who or what this participle phrase is describing?” (He, which in this sentence refers to Woody.)

- As needed, review the structure and function of participle phrases. Participle phrases begin with an **-ing** participle. These phrases function as adjectives because they modify, or describe, a noun in a sentence.

“Why do you think the authors provide this description of Woody?” (to provide a specific comparison between Woody and Papa)

“Which phrase in this chunk tells us this is a comparison?” (The chunk the way Papa would tells us this is a comparison.)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **He put his hands on his hips and gave Kiyo a sternly comic look, <u>squinting at him through one eye the way Papa would when he was asserting his authority.</u>**

- Ask:

“What if we move the participle phrase squinting at him through one eye the way Papa would when he was asserting his authority to the front of the sentence?” (The sentence is grammatical, and it still mostly makes sense, since this participle phrase is describing he \[Woody\], but it becomes slightly harder to understand because within the participle phrase, him refers to Kiyo; the participle phrase is at the beginning of the sentence, we don’t yet know that him refers to Kiyo.)

“How does this sentence use the methods of description and comparison to help make connections between individuals in Farewell to Manzanar?” (Responses will vary but should include that the authors describe how Woody puts his hands on his hips and the way in which he looks at Kiyo with the purpose of comparing Woody’s and Papa’s assertiveness and authoritativeness.)

“How can we use description and comparison in our speaking or writing?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all replies.)

- Ask:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target:  
I can analyze how the authors make connections among and distinctions between individuals, ideas, or events in Farewell to Manzanar?” (Responses will vary.)
