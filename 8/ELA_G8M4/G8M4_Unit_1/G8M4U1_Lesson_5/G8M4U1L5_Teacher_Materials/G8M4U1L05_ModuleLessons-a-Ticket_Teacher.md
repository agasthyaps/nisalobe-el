**Directions:** As you enter class, read the following excerpt from the “Power of Words Handbook,” and complete the table below.

**EVACUATE/EVACUATION**

The dictionary defines this verb/noun as “the process of temporarily moving people away from an immediate and real danger, such as a fire, flood, shoot-out, or bomb threat” (*Merriam-Webster Dictionary*, 2011, para. 1). Its usage to describe the forced removal by the federal government of over 110,000 Japanese and Japanese Americans from their homes on the West Coast and Arizona is not accurate. They were not “evacuated” to protect them from a disastrous environment. By using these words, the government only made it seem that these individuals were being “helped.”

**RECOMMENDATION:** The phrase **forced removal** should be used instead—which more accurately describes the lack of choice provided to Japanese Americans who were ordered to leave their homes.

**RELOCATE/RELOCATION**

These terms suggest that people voluntarily moved from one location (private homes) to another (War Relocation Authority camp). Their usage obscures the fact that the US military forced “all Japanese persons, both alien and non-alien” to leave their homes and many of their belongings behind, often with less than a week’s notice. See elsewhere in this document an image of a publicly posted US Army notice notifying Japanese Americans to “evacuate.”

**RECOMMENDATION:** The phrase **forced removal** should be used instead—which more accurately describes the lack of choice provided to Japanese Americans who were ordered to leave their homes.

**INTERNMENT**

As pointed out earlier, this word has a legal definition that refers to the confinement or impounding of enemy aliens in a time of war (*Merriam-Webster Dictionary*, 2011). Most of the several tens of thousands of people of Japanese ancestry who were incarcerated in WRA camps during World War II were American citizens; thus, the term does not apply. A few thousand mostly Issei men were held in the Army and DOJ internment camps, but with the family reunification program and Nikkei from Latin American countries, the total exceeded 17,000 men, women, and children.

**RECOMMENDATION:** The word **incarceration** more accurately describes those held in WRA camps. **Incarcerate** is generally defined as to confine or imprison, typically as punishment for a crime. This term reflects the prison-like conditions faced by Japanese Americans as well as the view that they were treated as if guilty of sabotage, espionage, and/or suspect loyalty.

| Word                | Which term does the “Power of Words Handbook” suggest instead of the listed word, and why?                                                                         |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| evacuate/evacuation | **The term *forced removal* should be used because Japanese Americans had no choice about leaving their homes.**                                                   |
| relocate/relocation | **The term *forced removal* should be used because Japanese Americans were ordered to leave their homes.**                                                         |
| internment          | **The word *incarceration* should be used because the Japanese Americans were held in prison-like conditions, and they were treated as if they were enemy spies.** |
