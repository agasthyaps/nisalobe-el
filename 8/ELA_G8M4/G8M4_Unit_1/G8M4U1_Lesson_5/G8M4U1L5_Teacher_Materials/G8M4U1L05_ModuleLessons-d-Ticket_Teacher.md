RI.8.3, RI.8.4

(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Complete the following questions about chapters 3 and 4.

1.  This question has two parts. First, answer Part A. Then, answer Part B and Part C.

**Part A**

Reread this sentence from chapter 3:

“Her eyes **blazed** then, her voice quietly furious. ‘Woody, we can’t live like this. Animals live like this.’” (24).

Which word from the sentence has a similar connotation to and helps the reader to understand the meaning of the word **blazed**? (RI.8.4)

2.  eyes

3.  quietly

4.  <u>furious</u>

5.  animals

**Part B**

Given the context of the paragraph, what does the connotation of the word **blazed** convey about Mama’s attitude toward the camp that the answer from Part A does not? (RI.8.4)

Responses will vary but may include: *Blazed* has a much more active and aggressive connotation than *furious*. They both suggest that Mama was upset and angry, but *blazed* suggests that even though her voice is quiet, her anger is accompanied by great passion and energy ready to reveal themselves. It shows that Mama was not just sad or passive or accepting of the conditions.

**Part C**

Which piece of evidence from chapter 4 <u>best</u> conveys the distinction between Woody’s attitude toward the camp and Mama’s attitude toward the camp (as shown in the answer to Part B)? (RI.8.1, RI.8.3)

1.  “In later years he would tour the country with Mr. Moto” (22).

<!-- -->

6.  “Woody mimicked Papa’s voice. ‘And I can tell the difference. So be careful’” (23).

7.  “. . . Woody came over and put his arms around her shoulder” (23).

8.  <u>“He’d keep smiling when everyone else was ready to explode” (24).</u>

9.  Based on your understanding of the chapter, how do the authors convey the connection between life in the internment camp and the feelings of humiliation and shame? (RI.8.1, RI.8.3)

10. by explaining how Mama and the women in camp altered the army-issue clothing

11. by describing the effects of the immunizations on the children in camp

12. <u>by including the anecdote about Mama’s experiences in the latrines</u>

13. by comparing the climate of coastal California with that experience in Manzanar

14. Reread this sentence from chapter 4:

“She would quickly **subordinate** her own desires to those of her family or the community, because she knew cooperation was the only way to survive” (30).

Given the context of the chapter, what does the word **subordinate** convey about Mama? (RI.8.4)

Responses will vary but may include: Mama didn’t think of herself or her own needs. Instead she thought of her family and the others in camp and endured whatever was necessary.

15. What significant idea about Mama is conveyed through the connections and distinctions in this chapter? (RI.8.3)

Responses will vary but may include: Mama has a deep sense of personal dignity, which was threatened by conditions at Manzanar.
