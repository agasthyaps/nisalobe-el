Close Reading Guide: *Farewell to Manzanar*, Chapter 7

RI.8.3, SL.8.1

(For Teacher Reference)

**Purpose and Notes**

- The purpose of this close read is for students to analyze chapter 7 of *Farewell to Manzanar* to understand the main figure, Papa. Students will see how his life is connected to the historical events in the text and see the distinction between Papa’s experience of being American and his interrogator’s experience. To do so, they will focus on key incidents and lines of dialogue in the text. In addition, they will determine the meanings of key words and phrases in the text, including figurative and connotative meanings, and explore the impact of specific words and phrases on meaning and tone. In this close read, students will focus only on pages 54–58 of *Farewell to Manzanar*.

- For the sake of time, the students have preread the pages as the previous lesson’s homework. During this lesson, provide a second reading of pages 54–58 as a read-aloud in class.

- Read these pages aloud, and prompt students to follow along, reading silently. From time to time, have students reread portions of the text aloud in a Readers Theater fashion in order to answer text-dependent questions.

- Students work in pairs for this close read. Since part of this will be done in Readers Theater fashion, students should be paired with this in mind. (If the Readers Theater sections are too challenging, read these aloud instead.)

- A note-catcher along with text-dependent questions provide an opportunity for students to think, talk, and write in order to analyze the text.

- Continue to use discussion protocols (e.g., Turn and Talk, cold call, and total participation techniques) to engage all students in collaborative discussion about the text.

<td>Before reading</td>

<li><p>Distribute the Close Read note-catcher.</p></li>
<li><p>Explain that we’re about to reread and zero in on an important section in the book.</p></li>
<li><p>Cold-call on students to quickly establish the gist of this section, that Papa is being interrogated at Fort Lincoln where he is being held prisoner.</p></li>
<li><p>Using a total participation technique, ask: “We read that Pearl Harbor has been bombed by the government of Japan, and America has become deeply fearful of anyone with Japanese ancestry. In these early days of the war, Japan seems to be winning. We know that Papa has been arrested and taken away from his family in California. How are those events connected to this moment where he is today?” (Papa is being held as a sort of prisoner in an interrogation camp in North Dakota. Because he is of Japanese descent, he is suspected of helping the enemy. His loyalty to America or Japan is being questioned.)</p></li>

<td>Read aloud page 54 to the top of page 55 (“Port Arthur in nineteen five”).</td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Direct students to read silently as you read aloud.</p></li>
<li><p>Cold-call on students to ask: “Why might it be important to the interrogator that Papa attended a military school?” (Japan’s military has just attacked America.) If needed, point out to students that Japan was becoming known for having a powerful and ruthless military system. (The interrogator seems to be worried that Papa is still connected to the Japanese military.)</p></li>
<li><p>Remind students that often we can tell a lot about a person’s ideas by what they say or do. Direct students to Turn and Talk with a partner for one minute about this question:</p></li>
<li><p>“What does Papa’s response show about how he felt about military life as a young man in Japan?” (Papa quit the school because he didn’t like all the marching. This indicates that he was not interested in a military life.)</p></li>

<li><p>Working as partners, direct students to discuss, and then record in their note-catchers, their responses to item 1:</p></li>
<li><p>“If you were filming this part of the conversation between Papa and the interrogator, what tone of voice would you have Papa use?” (Responses will vary, but students should note that Papa seems very sure of himself in all his answers. He shows his knowledge of both fishing and ocean travel. He is not rude, but he does not defer to the interrogator.)</p></li>

<li><p>Direct students to read aloud this section in pairs in Readers Theater fashion.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask students to Turn and Talk with their partner and respond in their note-catcher to the questions in item 2. Use a total participation technique to review student responses:</p></li>
<li><p>“What does this conversation show about Papa’s feelings/ideas about the war?” (Responses will vary, but students should note that Papa feels very critical of the military of both countries. He is sad about the war.)</p></li>
<li><p>“What do you think Papa means when he says, ‘Yes, it is still my country’? (He means that even though he thinks the Japanese military is wrong, he still loves Japan as his country).</p></li>
<li><p>“Why does Papa’s answer about Japan being his country seem to be so important to the interrogator? What distinction are the writers drawing between Papa and the interrogator?” (This is the reason Papa is here, to determine where his loyalty as a person of Japanese descent lies. The interrogator’s job is to find out if Papa will support America or Japan in the war.)</p></li>

<td>Read aloud from the middle of page 57 (“Do you feel any loyalty to Japan?”) to the bottom of page 58.</td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Direct students to read silently as you read the text aloud.</p></li>
<li><p>Direct students to discuss with their partners the following questions. Use a total participation technique to review responses:</p></li>
<li><p>“Why do you think the writers indicate ‘silence’ when the interrogator asks ‘Do you feel any loyalty to Japan?’” (Papa seems to need time to think about his next responses. He knows this is an important question.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask, “Who asks the question ‘How old are you?’” (Papa asks.)</p></li>
<li><p>Direct students to count the number of questions Papa asks the interrogator from here to the end of the chapter. (He asks seven questions.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask students to Turn and Talk and then write to answer these questions from item 3 on their note-catcher. Cold-call to review student responses:</p></li>
<li><p>“What does the number of questions Papa asks show about who is controlling the conversation at this point? How does this support what we know about Papa?” (Papa is very sure of his ideas and values. He knows what he thinks and seems to have thought about his situation a lot.)</p></li>
<li><p>“What does the conversation show us about the distinction between Papa and the interrogator?” (As a person of Japanese descent, Papa has no rights as a citizen, even though he has been in America for many years longer than the interrogator. The interrogator, in contrast, is a full American. He does not have to worry about belonging to this country, as Papa does.)</p></li>
<li><p>“Why is this distinction important for the story?” (It reminds us what a difficult position Papa is in. It even reminds us what a difficult position all the internees are in.)</p></li>

<tr class="even">
<td>Read aloud page 58.</td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Direct students to reread aloud, in Readers Theater fashion, page 58.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask, “What does Papa mean by his last question to the interrogator?” (He means that he wants the interrogator to think about how hard it is to choose between two people that you love. Papa wants the interrogator to understand his position.)</p></li>
<li><p>Explain that often in life feelings are not simple, and people have what we call “conflicted feelings” about something. When this happens, a person can feel two very different feelings about something at the same time.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask students to Turn and Talk then write to answer items 4–6 on their note-catcher. Use a total participation technique to review student responses:</p></li>
<li><p>“How is Papa’s last statement here an example of ‘conflicted feelings’?”</p></li>
<li><p>“Why do you think Papa uses the analogy of a mother and a father here? What does this analogy show about Papa’s feelings about both America and Japan?” (Just as he loves his parents equally, he loves his two countries equally and just wants them to stop fighting.)</p></li>
<li><p>“If you were filming this last statement of Papa’s, what tone of voice might you choose to have him use? What expression might you have on his face?” (Responses will vary, but could include: sad, thoughtful, regretful.)</p></li>
<li><p>“Why do you think the writers choose to end the chapter with this question of Papa’s? What significant idea do they want us to understand about Papa?” (They want to leave us with the idea that Papa loves both Japan and America, and that this war between them is very personally painful for him.)</p></li>
