RI.8.3

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** After the close read, answer the following question.

1.  What is one significant idea about Papa that is supported by this chapter? What evidence makes you think so? (RI.8.3)

In your response, be sure to include a clearly stated and significant idea about Papa and evidence from the text that supports your statement.

Responses will vary, but may include: One significant idea about Papa is that he feels conflicted because of his loyalties to both the United States and Japan. The interrogator wants Papa to indicate which of these two countries Papa feels connected to. When he asks Papa, “You say Japan is still your country?” (57), it’s evident that he believes that it isn’t possible to “have” two countries. Papa has to choose. Papa, on the other hand, feels deep connections to both places. He was born in Japan and has family there, but he has lived in the United States even longer than the American-born interrogator (57). He uses an analogy to talk about his feelings about the countries, comparing them to his mother and father and saying how he just wishes they would stop fighting.
