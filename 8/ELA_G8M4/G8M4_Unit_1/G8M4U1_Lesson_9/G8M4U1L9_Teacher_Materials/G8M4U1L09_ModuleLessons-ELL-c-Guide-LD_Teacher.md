5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

SL.8.1a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

It is the kind of thing **that always happens when military men are in control**. (from page 65 of *Farewell to Manzanar* by Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston and James D. Houston)

**Lesson 5 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after Work Time A.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target (**I can engage effectively in a collaborative discussion about a significant idea in the text by being prepared, drawing on my notes, and following rules for collegial discussions**) and SL.8.1a. This sentence addresses a significant idea in the text (the idea of internment was created out of dangerous and unsupported assumptions) and supports students in probing and reflecting on the question: **What were the causes and impacts of Japanese American internment camps?** This question is both a module guiding question and the discussion prompt for the End of Unit 1 Assessment.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses a relative clause (**that always happens when military men are in control**) phrase with the purpose of providing description.

- Transfer: **that** + verb phrase to provide description when discussing significant ideas from the text during the collaborative discussion in the End of Unit 1 Assessment.

- Note: A new significant idea from *Farewell to Manzanar* will be added to the Significant Ideas anchor chart during this Mini Language Dive.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **It is the kind of thing <u>that always happens when military men are in control</u>**.

- Ask:

“What is this sentence about?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **that always happens when military men are in control.**

- Ask:

“What noun phrase in the sentence is this relative clause describing?” (It is describing the kind of thing.)

“Which word helps us recognize this as a relative clause?” (The word that helps us recognize this as a relative clause.)

“Can you think of other words that can start relative clauses?” (Some other words are which, who, and where.)

“Can you figure out who military men are?” (Those in charge of a government’s military. The military includes armies, navies, and other groups that defend a country during wars.)

“What does it mean to be in control?” (to make decisions or to guide)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **It is the kind of thing <u>that always happens when military men are in control</u>**.

- Ask:

“What happens if we separate this sentence into two sentences?” (We end up with It is the kind of thing and The kind of thing always happens when military men are in control. The first sentence, while grammatical because it has a subject and a verb, doesn’t really make sense because the kind of thing requires a description in order for the reader to know what it is referring to. Putting that description in a separate sentence makes things choppy and harder to understand because the link between the kind of thing and its description is more separate.)

“What is Papa referring to in this sentence when he says It?” (the attack on Pearl Harbor)

“How does this sentence help us to understand the causes of Japanese American internment?” (The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor caused the United States to see Japan as an enemy. This led to fear and prejudice against innocent Japanese Americans.)

- Synthesize students’ ideas, and add the following significant idea to the Significant Ideas anchor chart: **Internment was created out of dangerous and unsupported assumptions.** Give students a moment to reflect.

“How does this sentence connect to the significant idea that internment was created out of dangerous and unsupported assumptions? (It suggests that the military might be responsible for making dangerous assumptions based on fear and prejudice, leading to problems.)

“How can we use description and comparison in our speaking or writing?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all replies.)

- Ask:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target:  
I can engage effectively in a collaborative discussion about a significant idea in the text by being prepared, drawing on my notes, and following rules for collegial discussions)?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is the kind of thing \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
>
> noun phrase **that** + verb phrase

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

- Say:

“Use this frame to talk about something that caused Japanese American internment.”

- Responses will vary, but may include:

> **<u>Prejudice</u>** is the kind of thing **<u>that led to Japanese American internment</u>**.
>
> noun phrase **that** + verb phrase
