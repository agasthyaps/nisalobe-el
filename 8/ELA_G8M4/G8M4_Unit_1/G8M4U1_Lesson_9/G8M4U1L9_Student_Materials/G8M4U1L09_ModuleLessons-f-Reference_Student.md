**Chapter 7 “Fort Lincoln: An Interview”**

- Papa is interviewed by the US government.

- The interviewer asks Papa what he was carrying in barrels on his fishing boat, suspecting him of delivering oil to a Japanese ship. Papa explains the barrels contained bait for fishing.

- The interviewer asks Papa what his opinion is of the bombing of Pearl Harbor. He says he is sad for both the United States and Japan. He also says that he would not want his sons to serve in the military because he doesn’t believe war is necessary.

- The interviewer asks about Papa’s loyalty to Japan and asks him who he wants to win the war. He uses a metaphor to explain how he feels about the war: The experience is like his mother and father fighting. He doesn’t want either side to win. He just wants it to end.
