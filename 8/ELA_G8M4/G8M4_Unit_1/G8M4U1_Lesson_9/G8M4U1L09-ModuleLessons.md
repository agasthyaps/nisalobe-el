Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.8.3 – Opening A: On an entrance ticket, students describe distinctions between events made in chapter 5 of *Farewell to Manzanar* and relate them to a significant idea conveyed in the text.

- RI.8.3 – Work Time A: Students analyze how connections are made across individuals, events, and ideas in chapter 7.

- RI.8.3 – Work Time B: Students consider connections made across the text and use this information to identify and write a significant idea conveyed about Papa in the text.

- SL.8.1 – Closing and Assessment A: Students participate in a collaborative discussion about a significant idea about Papa that is found in the chapter.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners by showing respect to classmates during the close read and collaborative discussion.

- In Work Time A, students participate in a close read of chapter 7 of *Farewell to Manzanar*. During this close read, students analyze how the text makes connections among individuals, ideas, and events. The Close Reading Guide lists the text excerpts, key questions to ask students, and required instructional moves. Continue to use discussion protocols (e.g., Think-Pair-Share, Conversation Cues, and total participation techniques) to engage all students throughout the close read.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- For homework, students preread chapters 8 and 9 of *Farewell to Manzanar*. Invite students to write their own close read questions, modeling them after the questions they encounter during the close read of this lesson. Student-generated questions should center on distinctions and connections made among individuals, ideas, or events in chapters 8 and 9.

- The close read of Work Time A centers on chapter 7 of the text, which depicts an interrogator questioning Papa’s loyalties to Japan and the United States. The chapter is presented entirely in dialogue. Challenge students to rewrite a portion of the chapter in prose, incorporating and embedding direct and partial quotes and paraphrases of the content. This exercise will reinforce students’ understanding of the chapter, as well as provide the opportunity to practice bringing direct quotes into prose, which may be useful as students begin their literary argument essays in Unit 2.

- An optional Mini Language Dive, intended for use after work with SL.8.1a after the close read in Work Time A, is available in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Earlier in the unit, students analyzed connections made in *Farewell to Manzanar* across individuals, ideas, and events to build a deep understanding of the text. This work is revisited during the close read of this lesson, as students read and analyze chapter 7 of *Farewell to Manzanar*. Also, in the previous two lessons, students read supplemental informational texts that described experiences of internment beyond those of the individuals in *Farewell to Manzanar*. These texts provide context that helps students understand significant ideas in chapter 7.

Support All Students

- Note that there is a differentiated version of Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 9 used in Opening A in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Students may need additional support with recording their answers on their note-catchers. Consider sitting those students in a group together for additional support when necessary. ▲

- In chapter 7, during Papa’s interview, he compares the relationship between Japan and the United States to a relationship between two parents fighting. Be mindful that this may be a sensitive topic for some students. As needed, seek the support of a school guidance counselor for further suggestions on how to help students navigate this content.

- Students may need additional support working independently to prepare for the text-based collaborative discussion. Consider grouping ELLs and students who require additional support with peers who have strong language proficiency. ▲

- Create a supportive and inclusive classroom environment by reminding students that everyone is working toward getting better at class discussions. Be sure to highlight and praise growth and development rather than relative performance. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson features a close read of chapter 7 of *Farewell to Manzanar* with a culminating task and a practice collaborative discussion connected to chapter 7 of the text. This work will help to prepare students for the End of Unit 1 Assessment in Lesson 12, in which students will discuss the causes and impacts of Japanese American internment camps. Students will also be introduced to the concept of significant ideas and consider how significant ideas in a text differ from central ideas. This will further help students to prepare for the End of Unit 1 Assessment and will, in general, provide students with a tool for making meaning of *Farewell to Manzanar* and of other texts they encounter in this module and beyond.

- ELLs may find it challenging to differentiate between significant ideas and central ideas in *Farewell to Manzanar*. Doing so will require a deep understanding of both isolated events and ideas and overarching themes, all of which require a solid grasp of language to interpret. Support students in noticing and identifying what they can, and assure them that they will continue to build proficiency in identifying significant ideas in the unit and throughout the Module. ELLs might also find it challenging to articulate their ideas during the collaborative discussion. Use Conversation Cues and sentence starters to support students in navigating this task effectively.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.A.1, 8.I.A.2, 8.I.B.6, and 8.II.A.1.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Close Read: *Farewell to Manzanar*, Chapter 7 note-catchers and culminating task to ensure that students understand how the chapter makes distinctions and connections across people, ideas, and events and supports a significant idea in the text.

- Monitor students’ participation in the collaborative discussion during Closing and Assessment A to ensure that students are following discussion norms.

- The End of Unit 1 Assessment features a collaborative discussion similar to that in Closing and Assessment A. Consider reviewing the End of Unit 1 Assessment Recording Sheet prior to the collaborative discussion of this lesson to better understand what will be expected of students on the assessment. If students struggle during Closing and Assessment A to meet any of the criteria on the recording sheet, additional support can be offered during the lessons leading up to the end of unit assessment.

Down the Road

- In the following lessons, students will continue to read *Farewell to Manzanar* and watch another corresponding segment of the film. The format of the collaborative discussion in Closing and Assessment A of this lesson will be revisited during End of Unit 1 Assessment. Also, in Unit 2, students have the opportunity to write a pair practice essay about Papa, which may draw from ideas generated during this lesson’s close read.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Ensure there is a copy of Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 9 at each student’s workspace.

- Strategically group students into pairs for the close read of Work Time A. Be mindful of students’ needs when selecting students to work together. For example, consider pairing ELLs who need heavier support with ELLs who need lighter support, rather than with students who do not need any additional support understanding English. A smaller difference in range of language ability may help prevent one student from dominating the activity. ▲

- Preview Close Reading Guide: *Farewell to Manzanar*, Chapter 7 (for teacher reference), Close Read: *Farewell to Manzanar*, Chapter 7 note-catcher (example for teacher reference), and Close Reading Culminating Task: *Farewell to Manzanar*, Chapter 7 (example for teacher reference) to become familiar with what is required of students.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Times A and B: Students may complete their note-catchers and culminating task using an online word-processing platform such as http://eled.org/0158.

- Work Time A: For students who will benefit from hearing the texts read aloud multiple times, use a text-to-speech tool such as http://eled.org/0103. Note that to use a web-based text-to-speech tool, an online doc will need to be created—for example, http://eled.org/0158, containing the text. ▲

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous modules to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.8.3 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **1**, **Lesson** **9** or the optional **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **1**, **Lesson** **9** ▲.

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, draw students’ attention to the **Significant** **Ideas** **anchor** **chart**, and add the significant idea presented in the entrance ticket: Manzanar pulled the Wakatsuki family apart. Use a total participation technique to review students’ responses to the second question on the entrance ticket, and add relevant notes to the anchor chart.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons. Tell students that the habit of character focus of this lesson is respect.

For Lighter Support

For Heavier Support

- During Opening A, invite students who need heavier support to use Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 9 ▲. This resource includes a simple graphic organizer to help students organize and record their thinking.

Work Time

A. Close Read: *Farewell to Manzanar*, Chapter 7 – RI.8.3 (20 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze how the text makes connections among and distinctions between individuals, events, and ideas in chapter 7 of *Farewell to Manzanar*.”

- Focus students on the **Close** **Readers** **Do** **These** **Things** **anchor** **chart** and remind them that digging into the text deeper can help them understand it better, so they are going to dig deeper into chapter 7 of *Farewell to Manzanar* through close reading.

- Move students into predetermined pairs. Use the **Close** **Reading** **Guide**: ***Farewell to Manzanar,* Chapter** **7** (**for** **teacher** **reference**) to set the purpose of the close read and to guide students through a close read of this chapter of ***Farewell to Manzanar***. Distribute and display the **Close** **Read**: ***Farewell to Manzanar,* Chapter** **7** **note** - **catcher**. Refer to the guide for how to integrate the note-catcher. Also as necessary, draw on the **Synopsis**: ***Farewell to Manzanar***, **Chapter** **7** to guide students in reading the text.

- Refer to Close Reading Guide: *Farewell to Manzanar*, Chapter 7 (for teacher reference) and **Close** **Read**: ***Farewell to Manzanar,* Chapter** **7** **note** - **catcher** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as necessary.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time A, invite students to participate in a Mini Language Dive to explore textual evidence connected to a significant idea: that prejudice was a cause of Japanese American internment camps (SL.8.1a). As in the Mini Language Dive in Lesson 2, this Mini Language Dive also gives students the opportunity for further work with a relative clause, a useful structure for description that students can apply in their own speaking and writing. Help students to notice the connection and similarities between the structure of the sentences in both Language Dives.

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from *Farewell to Manzanar* to explore a significant idea from the text in preparation for the collaborative discussion during End of Unit 1 Assessment. Provide ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Invite students who need lighter support to predict some of the questions that the Language Dive may ask. This will improve students’ metacognition and challenge their awareness of the most interesting or meaningful elements of the sentence. Students may also choose to carry out one of the following:

- Paraphrase the sentence using your own words.

- Underline all noun phrases, circle all verb phrases, and star all adjective and adverb phrases. What words do you have left? What are the functions of these phrases?

For Heavier Support

- To extend work with relative clauses after the optional Mini Language Dive in Work Time A, invite students to practice combining sentences to provide a cohesive description using restrictive (essential) relative clauses beginning with *that*. Use the following pairs of sentences:

- Japanese American internment was something. Something was based on fear of others.

- Manzanar was a place. A place had simple, uncomfortable barracks.

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from *Farewell to Manzanar* to explore a significant idea from the text in preparation for the collaborative discussion during End of Unit 1 Assessment. Provide ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Encourage students who need heavier support to independently reflect on this sentence and its meaning before the next lesson. Students may also choose to carry out one of the following:

- Make a guess about what the chunks of the sentence might be.

- Use a dictionary to look up the word *emasculation*, and select the best definition for the word as it is used in this sentence.

Work Time

B. Culminating Task – RI.8.3 (5 minutes)

- Display and distribute **Close** **Reading** **Culminating** **Task**: ***Farewell to Manzanar***, **Chapter** **7**. Read the question aloud for students and field any clarifying questions before students work independently to complete the culminating task.

- Monitor students’ work as they complete the task, referring to **Close** **Reading** **Culminating** **Task**: ***Farewell to Manzanar***, **Chapter** **7** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as needed.

- Refocus the whole group. Tell students that their responses to the culminating task will help them participate in a collaborative discussion about Papa.

Closing and Assessment

A. Collaborative Discussion – SL.8.1 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can engage effectively in a collaborative discussion about a significant idea in the text by being prepared, drawing on my notes, and following rules for collegial discussions.”

- Tell students that they will participate in a collaborative discussion based on the prompt from the culminating task. This discussion will help students practice for the end of unit assessment, which features another collaborative discussion to answer a different question. In both discussions, students will follow discussion norms and draw upon preparation (in this case, their answers to the prompt on the culminating task).

- Draw students’ attention to the **Discussion** **Norms** **anchor** **chart**. Give them an opportunity to reread the items on the chart. Remind students that effective participation in a discussion requires more than sharing their thoughts aloud; it also requires listening to others, asking questions to better understand what others are saying, and answering questions to clarify their own points.

- Focus students on the **Work** **to** **Become** **Ethical** **People** **anchor** **chart**. Remind students that it is not easy for everyone to participate in a discussion. Uplift the habit of respect in preparation for the discussion.

- Turn and Talk:

“What does respect look like during a collaborative discussion?” (Responses will vary, but may include: listening carefully and quietly as others share ideas; building on the ideas of others; disagreeing politely.)

- Begin the discussion, using the question from the culminating task. Remind students that their responses should be supported with evidence from the chapter.

“What is one significant idea about Papa that is supported by this chapter? What evidence in the text makes you think that?” (Responses may vary, but are likely to be variations of the idea that Papa feels conflicted because of his loyalties to both the United States and Japan.)

- As needed, use Goal 4 Conversation Cues early in the discussion to spark students’ contributions and help them think with others to expand the conversation.

“How is what \_\_\_\_ said the same as/different from what \_\_\_\_ said?”

“Do you agree or disagree with what your classmate said? Why?”

“Who can add on to what your classmate said?”

“Who can explain why your classmate came up with that response?”

- Make sure to reduce the use of Conversation Cues as the discussion progresses so that students assume ownership over the discussion and direct their responses to one another.

- As the discussion culminates, draw students’ attention again to the Significant Ideas anchor chart. Cold-call students to share their understanding of the significant idea about Papa from this chapter and how it is conveyed. Invite students to also reference evidence from other passages in the text that also convey this significant idea (e.g., Papa burning the Japanese flag in chapter 1). Add relevant notes to the anchor chart.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, respect, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- Before the collaborative discussion, review the Conversation Cues students have been using while practicing speaking skills associated with SL.8.1. Work as a class to generate a list of sentence starters based on these, and other phrases, that students can refer to during the text-based discussion.

For Heavier Support

- In advance of the collaborative discussion, prepare individual sticky notes for students that include a list of sentence starters based on Conversation Cues that students can refer to during the discussion when they wish to elaborate or clarify information. These might include things like the following:

- ““, do you mean \_\_\_\_\_?”

- “Sure. I think that \_\_\_\_\_.”

- “OK. One example is \_\_\_\_\_.”

- “No, sorry, that’s not what I mean. I mean \_\_

Homework

A. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread chapters 8 and 9 of *Farewell to Manzanar* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.
