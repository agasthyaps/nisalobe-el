Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.8.8 – Opening A: On an entrance ticket, students answer questions about relevant evidence.

- RI.8.8 – Work Time A: Students sort relevant and irrelevant information on a topic.

- RI.8.6 – Work Time B: Students complete sections of their Delineate an Argument: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 3 graphic organizer and analyze how the author acknowledges and responds to conflicting viewpoints.

- RI.8.8: Work Time B – Students complete sections of their Delineate an Argument: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 3 graphic organizer as they review and evaluate the argument and claims in section 3 of the text.

- RI.8.6 – Closing and Assessment A: Students give examples of conflicting viewpoints on a variety of real-world situations.

- The Think-Pair-Share and Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocols are used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of the curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- In this lesson, students practice becoming effective learners, showing perseverance as they learn how to delineate and evaluate arguments and analyze the nuances of their validity. Students also practice effective collaboration as they work with a variety of partners throughout the lesson.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- In this lesson, students review section 3 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* for their work on the Delineate Argument: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 3 graphic organizer. Provide time for students to read all of chapter 5.

- Continue to invite students to research more about factory farms, feedlots, and animal processing to better understand the history of industrial meat. Students can share what they learn through these interviews in small groups or with the class.

- Invite students to find additional texts and resources with conflicting viewpoints that center around the same topic as this lesson’s excerpts from *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* (industrial farming). Support students to identify where irrelevant evidence is presented or in identifying false statements and fallacious reasoning that may exist.

- Find additional interviews, speeches, or video on industrial farming, and allow students to evaluate the speaker’s point of view, reasoning, and use of evidence and rhetoric. Help students identify any fallacious reasoning and point out any exaggerated or distorted evidence.

- As appropriate for students, use the Delineate an Argument: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 3 graphic organizer in Work Time B with more or less scaffolding.

- Additional text excerpts from *Chew* *on* *This* by Eric Schlosser and Charles Wilson discuss similar topics as section 3 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* and add depth and further foundational understanding about topics such as feedlots, slaughterhouses, industrial food processing, and the meat industry for students. Using pages 151–156 and 159–163 of *Chew* *on* *This*, have students identify the arguments presented to analyze the relevance and sufficiency of the evidence and the soundness of the reasoning.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students examined the Delineate Argument: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 3 graphic organizer, focusing on the main claim, supporting points, and relevance and sufficiency of evidence. In this lesson, students look at irrelevant evidence and conflicting information. Previously, students also discussed the author’s point of view and examined how the author responded to or acknowledged conflicting viewpoints. During this lesson, students dig deeper into the author’s point of view by analyzing arguments he raises in the text. Students also examine evidence that is relevant or irrelevant to the claim in this section of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*.

Support All Students

- Presenting learning targets in writing, orally, and, if possible, accompanied by symbols, will help students to understand the language within them. ▲

- Note that section 3 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* brings up potentially sensitive topics such as slaughtering animals, CAFOs (Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations), and references animal treatment at feedlots. Some students and their families may find these topics upsetting. Allow time for students to process or respond to these topics during individual, small group, or full class discussion, and reach out to families as needed.

- When grouping students in partners to review the Delineate an Argument: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 3 graphic organizer in Work Time B, group ELLs with partners who have more advanced or native language proficiency. The partners with greater language proficiency can serve as a model, initiating discussions and providing implicit sentence frames, for example. Use the same grouping in future lessons if this grouping was successful. This will support students in building trust and becoming more comfortable and confident with their peers. ▲

- Preselect partners for students who would benefit from more advanced or native language proficiency for their work in Opening A and the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol used in Closing and Assessment A. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson builds on work with delineating arguments and relevant and sufficient evidence in Lesson 4. Students sort relevant and irrelevant evidence and then continue using the graphic organizer introduced in the previous lesson. They also consider how the author responds to conflicting viewpoints. In Closing and Assessment A, students engage in the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol to further consider relevant and irrelevant evidence. This activity includes work with tangible scenarios to help students better understand the concept of relevance.

- ELLs may find it challenging to identify relevant and irrelevant evidence and conflicting viewpoints. Students will benefit from support around working with unfamiliar vocabulary to help them understand information and ideas so that they can carry out work with analyzing relevancy and viewpoint. During the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol, pair students with supportive peers who can help them navigate discussion.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6, 8.I.B.7, and 8.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- Monitor students’ Delineate an Argument: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 3 graphic organizer work in Work Time B to ensure students capture accurate main claims, supporting points, and related evidence as identified with guidance.

Down the Road

- In future lessons, students will go back to examining the structure of specific paragraphs in *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, analyzing how the structure contributes to developing key ideas in the text. Students will discuss the author’s point of view and examine how the author responds to or acknowledges conflicting viewpoints prior to having another lesson on delineating argument and analyzing evidence in Lesson 6.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.8.8 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As they arrive, students complete **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **1**, **Lesson** **5**.

- Prompt students to Turn and Talk about their answers to the entrance ticket. Clarify any misconceptions about the relevant evidence they identified, and explain to students that today’s lesson will help them examine evidence that is unrelated, or *irrelevant*, to claims an author presents.

- Using a preferred classroom routine, collect or review the answers to **Homework**: **Delineate** **Arguments**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma***, **Section** **3**. Refer to **Homework**: **Delineate** **Arguments**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma***, **Section** **3** (**answers** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as needed.

Work Time

A. Sort Relevant and Irrelevant Evidence – RI.8.8 (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can distinguish between relevant and irrelevant evidence.”

- Ask students to find a partner and Turn and Talk to review their understanding of the word *relevant*:

“Remind your partner, what does *relevant* mean?” (*Relevant* means something that is connected or applicable.)

“What is relevant evidence? Why is it important to include relevant evidence when making an argument?” (Relevant evidence is connected to the claim and helps illuminate the point being made to the reader.)

- Explain to students that in addition to looking at evidence that is connected to the claim, it is also important to be able to identify irrelevant evidence. Ask partners to Think-Pair-Share:

“What does the word *irrelevant* mean?” (*Irrelevant* means something that does not apply or is not connected.)

“What is irrelevant evidence?” (Irrelevant evidence is not connected to the claim and does not help the reader understand the point being made.)

- With students’ support, record the meaning of the term *irrelevant* on the **academic** **word** **wall**. Invite students to record the term in their **vocabulary** **logs**.

- Display and distribute the **Sort** **Relevant** **and** **Irrelevant** **Evidence** **note** - **catcher**, and prompt students to capture the definitions of *relevant* and *irrelevant* in the spaces provided.

- Read the directions aloud while students follow along. Distribute a sheet of **Relevant** **and** **Irrelevant** **Evidence** **sorting** **strips** to each pair. Direct partners to cut out the strips and sort the given evidence, naming each piece as relevant or irrelevant and sorting them into piles as indicated on the note-catcher. Use the **Sort** **Relevant** **and** **Irrelevant** **Evidence** **note** - **catcher** (**answers** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as needed, and answer any questions that students have about sorting the evidence.

- Once partners have completed their sorting, prompt them to join another partner group, forming quads. Direct quads to Think-Pair-Share, and discuss:

“Was there any evidence that was hard to categorize? Why?” (Responses will vary.)

“Identify one more piece of relevant evidence and one more piece of irrelevant evidence for the argument being made.” (Responses will vary.)

“Can you think of other examples, in real life, where you will need to analyze and sort relevant and irrelevant evidence?” (Responses will vary, but may include: when analyzing political candidates and the policies they support, or when investigating a topic of interest to them, etc.)

- Explain to students that they will now analyze relevant and irrelevant evidence from section 3 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Work Time

B. Irrelevant Evidence and Conflicting Viewpoints – RI.8.8 (20 minutes)

- Review the learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can evaluate an argument, assessing whether Michael Pollan’s evidence presented on the topic of industrial farming is relevant.”

“I can evaluate an argument, analyzing how Michael Pollan responds to conflicting viewpoints.”

- Explain to students that they will continue using the **Delineate** **an** **Argument**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma,* Section** **3** **graphic** **organizer** that they started in the previous lesson. Display the graphic organizer, and direct students to retrieve their copies.

- Focus students on the first question at the end of the graphic organizer on irrelevant evidence. Explain that in *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* there is not much irrelevant evidence because Pollan has done careful research and is presenting information and evidence that align to his beliefs. It is important, however, to be able to recognize information that may be irrelevant to an author’s claim. Because of that, this question will help them practice identifying what irrelevant information might look like.

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“Why is it important to identify irrelevant information when you are delineating an argument?” (Responses will vary, but may include the idea that knowing an argument well also means you can distinguish between evidence that does and does not support the argument.)

- Prompt partners to read through the options given for potential pieces of irrelevant evidence, discussing each option and determining the best response. Use **equity** **sticks** to call on a student to share his or her answer and the reasoning behind it. (Students should identify that answer A is irrelevant because, although it is a true statement, it does not connect to the main claim Pollan is making about industrial farming in this section of the text.).

- Ask students to Turn and Talk:

“Can you think of another piece of evidence that would be irrelevant to his claim?” (Responses will vary but should reference evidence from the section that does not connect to the claim.)

- Prompt students to think about how they know if evidence is relevant or irrelevant, and then invite them to Turn and Talk:

“What are some strategies you can use to identify irrelevant evidence in the future?” (Responses will vary, but may include that irrelevant evidence will be off topic, it could be distracting, it might be interesting but not in support of the main claim, etc.)

- Focus students on the second question on the Delineate an Argument: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 3 graphic organizer, which asks students to think about conflicting viewpoints that are presented in the text. Remind students that an important aspect of delineating arguments is looking for places where conflicting points of view are presented or implied and noting how the author acknowledges or responds to those viewpoints. Thoughtful authors think about what other points of view on a topic might look like. They make sure they address these conflicting points of view in their own arguments.

- Display and ask students to retrieve their copies of the **Author’s** **Purpose** **and** **Point** **of** **View**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma*** **note** - **catcher**. Prompt students to also retrieve their copy of ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma*** and open to page 63. Direct students to read aloud with their partners, starting at “Only certain animals . . . ” and ending on page 65 at “ . . . fast food indeed.”

- Ask:

“What is Michael Pollan’s viewpoint on how cattle should be fed?” (He believes that cattle have evolved to eat grass.)

“What is the conflicting viewpoint that is implied in this section?” (Cattle should be raised on corn.)

“How does the author respond to the conflicting viewpoint?” (by pointing out that cattle raised on corn mature more quickly and can be sold for beef earlier, which benefits the industrial farmer, yet cattle have stomachs that evolved to eat grass, and eating a diet of grass takes them more time to mature.)

- As students share, record their responses at the bottom section of the displayed Purpose and Point of View: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* note-catcher, under “Conflicting Viewpoint.” Note the page number and topic, the viewpoint the author addresses, and the author’s conflicting viewpoint. Instruct students to follow along and record responses on their own note-catchers. Refer to **Author’s** **Purpose** **and** **Point** **of** **View**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma*** **note** - **catcher** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Focus students back on their Delineate an Argument: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 3 graphic organizer, and explain to students that they will look for ways that Pollan responds to the conflicting viewpoints presented about how cattle are fed. Direct partners to reread the last question on the graphic organizer and select the appropriate response. As necessary, refer to **Delineate** **an** **Argument**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma,* Section** **3** **graphic** **organizer** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Use a total participation technique to review responses and discuss as a group, addressing any questions that arise about conflicting viewpoints.

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“How does Michael Pollan make his argument stronger by presenting this alternate viewpoint?” (Pollan acknowledges the claim that feeding cattle corn is healthy, and then counters it with the details of various illnesses cattle may experience. By providing evidence against the conflicting viewpoint, he strengthens his own claim.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- To help students better understand conflicting evidence, invite them to make claims about everyday topics (e.g., school, television, food) for their classmates to provide conflicting evidence to.

For Heavier Support

- To help students better understand conflicting evidence, invite them to provide conflicting evidence to claims about everyday topics. For example:

- Television is a waste of time.

- Students should be able to use cell phones in class.

- Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.

- Students should have four hours of homework every night.

Closing and Assessment

A. Conflicting Viewpoints – RI.8.6 (10 minutes)

- Remind students that in this lesson, they learned to delineate arguments by recognizing irrelevant information and analyze conflicting viewpoints. Explain that they will practice using these new skills in familiar contexts.

- Prompt students to find a partner, and lead them through the following series of questions using the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol. Each situation presents a real-world scenario where varying viewpoints may exist. Prompt students to find a new partner in between each question.

- Situation 1: Getting a new cell phone. Should you be allowed to get a new cell phone since yours is a hand-me-down?

“What is the viewpoint you may have?” (Responses will vary, but may include: I think I should have a new cell phone.)

“What reason supports this viewpoint?” (Responses will vary, but may include: the phone I have is my brother’s old one, and it’s out of date.)

“What is a conflicting viewpoint your parents may have?” (You do not need a new cell phone.)

“What reason supports this viewpoint?” (Responses will vary, but may include: a phone being out of date doesn’t affect how well it works.)

- Situation 2: Increasing the driving age. The state you live in wants to increase the driving age from 16 to 18 in order to help reduce traffic accidents.

“What is the viewpoint you may have?” (Sixteen-year-olds should be able to get their driver’s license.)

“What reason supports this viewpoint?” (Responses will vary, but may include that most accidents happen from distracted drivers, regardless of their age.)

“What is a conflicting viewpoint the state may have?” (Citizens need to be eighteen years old before applying for a driver’s license.)

“What reason supports this viewpoint?” (Responses will vary, but may include that older drivers have fewer accidents than younger drivers.)

- Situation 3: Getting a summer job. Your parents want you to get a summer job at the local ice-cream shop.

“What is the viewpoint you may have?” (Responses will vary, but may include that teenagers should have time off in the summer after working hard in school all year.)

“What reason supports this viewpoint?” (Responses will vary, but may include that teenagers require many hours of sleep each night, and working long hours would get in the way of sufficient sleep.)

“What is a conflicting viewpoint your parents may have?” (You should have a summer job.)

“What reason supports this viewpoint?” (Responses will vary, but may include that jobs help teenagers learn valuable life skills like time and money management.)

- As time permits, invite two students to brainstorm additional situations and share them with their peers. Continue to present the situations and ask students to respond using the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- To help students navigate the Back-to-Back Face-to-Face protocol, strategically use Goal 1 Conversation Cues:

- “Can you say more about that?”

- “Can you give an example?”

- “So, do you mean \_\_\_\_\_?”

Homework

A. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 4 (pages 88–89, 91–93, 96–100), in preparation for studying an excerpt from the section in the next lesson.
