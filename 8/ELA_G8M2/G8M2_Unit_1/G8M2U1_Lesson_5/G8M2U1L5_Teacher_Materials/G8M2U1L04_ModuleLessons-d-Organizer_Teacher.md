<td>Purpose</td>
<td><p>What is the author’s purpose for writing this text? (RI.8.6)</p>
<p><strong>The author’s purpose is to show what the industrial farming system for raising cattle is like.</strong></p></td>

<td>Main Claim</td>
<td><p>What is the main claim of this section of text? (This may be implied.) (RI.8.8)</p>
<p><strong>Raising cattle in an industrial farm setting is a terrible way to raise beef.</strong></p></td>

<td>Supporting Point 1</td>
<td><p>What is one supporting point for the main claim? (RI.8.8)</p>
<p><strong>Cattle have evolved to eat grass, and when they are fed a diet of corn, they easily become sick.</strong></p></td>

<td>Relevant Evidence Used to Develop Point</td>
<td><p>What is the relevant evidence that supports this point? (RI.8.8)</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> <strong>“Basically, almost all of the cattle in the feedlot are sick. And it’s their corn-based diet that makes them ill” (70).</strong></p>
<p><strong>•</strong> <strong>“Feeding corn to a steer changes the chemistry of the rumen, making it acid and causing a kind of heartburn that in some cases can kill the animal, but usually just makes him sick” (72).</strong></p></td>

<tr class="odd">
<td>Supporting Point 2</td>
<td><p>What is one supporting point for the main claim? (RI.8.8)</p>
<p><strong>Feeding cattle, which are herbivores, parts of other animals can also make them sick.</strong></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Relevant Evidence Used to Develop Point</td>
<td><p>What is the relevant evidence that supports this point? (RI.8.8)</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> <strong>“Ground-up cattle brains were put into cattle feed and some of those cows got mad cow disease” (69).</strong></p>
<p><strong>•</strong> <strong>“For years, leftover beef scraps were ground up and put into cattle feed” (69).</strong></p>
<p><strong>•</strong> <strong>“Mad cow disease is a brain disease that is always fatal. It is spread by eating the brains of infected animals” (69).</strong></p>
<p><strong>•</strong> <strong>“Feather meal and chicken litter (that is bedding, feces, and discarded bits of feed from chicken farms) are accepted cattle feeds” (70).</strong></p></td>

<tr class="odd">
<td>Sufficient Evidence</td>
<td><p>Is the evidence presented in this text section sufficient? Why or why not? (RI.8.8)</p>
<p><strong>Responses will vary, but may include: The evidence presented in this section is sufficient because it presents enough information that helps the reader understand practices at feedlots. It makes the reader consider the negative aspects of industrial farming practices, and it helps the reader understand that the claim that there are better ways to raise beef than in an industrial setting makes sense.</strong></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Sound Reasoning</td>
<td><p>Is the reasoning shared in this text section sound? Why or why not? (RI.8.8)</p>
<p><strong>Yes, the reasoning in this text section is sound. The evidence is relevant and sufficient, and the sentences Michael Pollan uses are tied together logically so the reader can follow the author’s thinking. For example, on pages 72 and 73, Pollan provides evidence of how a corn-based diet can make cattle sick. After doing so, he explains this evidence and uses it to further support the point that cows become sick from the practices used in industrial farming. The reasoning on the bottom of page 72 and at the top of page 73 helps the reader connect the ideas presented about industrial farming practices back to the claim about better ways of raising cattle than how it is raised in an industrial setting.</strong></p></td>

**Directions:** Answer the questions about irrelevant evidence and conflicting viewpoints in this section of text.

1.  Which of the following pieces of evidence, if the author chose to include it, would be irrelevant to the author’s claim? (RI.8.8)

2.  <u>It takes many years of training to become a large-animal vet.</u>

3.  A corn diet can give cattle acidosis, which is too much acid in the rumen.

4.  Industrially raised animals require a diet of antibiotics to ensure they do not get sick.

5.  Many industrial farms watch out for sick animals and transfer them to separate areas for treatment.

6.  On page 70 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, it says:

“Compared to all of the other things we feed cattle these days, corn seems positively wholesome. Yet feeding corn to cattle goes against the natural order almost as much as feeding them beef.”

How does Michael Pollan respond to this conflicting viewpoint that corn is wholesome? (RI.8.6)

7.  by referencing research about the importance of more humane treatment of cattle

8.  by referencing research about the impacts of industrial beef on the environment

9.  by explaining specific ways in which the industrial food chain impacts human health

10. <u>by explaining the various illnesses corn-fed cattle may experience</u>
