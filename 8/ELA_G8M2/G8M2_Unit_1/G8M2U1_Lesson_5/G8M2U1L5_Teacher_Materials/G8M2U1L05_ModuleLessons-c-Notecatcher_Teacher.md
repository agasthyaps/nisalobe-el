RI.8.8

(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Directions**

Capture the definitions of **relevant** and **irrelevant** from your class discussion below:

- **Relevant** means: **something that is connected or applicable**.

- **Irrelevant** means: **something that does not apply or is not connected**.

You are a member of the student council and you are writing a proposal to try to convince the school cafeteria to serve pizza two days a week, instead of just one. You are collecting evidence to put in your proposal.

1.  Sort the evidence on the sentence strips into two piles: evidence that is relevant to the topic, and evidence that is irrelevant to the topic.

2.  Glue the strips into the chart below.

3.  Discuss your sorted evidence with another partner group.

<td><p><strong>Pizza is easier to make than some of the other meals on rotation in the school cafeteria, so it will be easier for the kitchen staff to have a familiar meal to cook.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pizza is healthy—it contains vegetables, dairy, and protein.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pizza is a low-sugar food, so it is a better choice for students than foods like sugary yogurt parfaits.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pizza is less expensive to make than the other meals on rotation in the cafeteria.</strong></p>
<p><strong>There are fewer dishes used to cook and eat pizza, which means clean-up is more efficient.</strong></p></td>
<td><p><strong>When students were polled about their favorite foods, the top items were chicken nuggets and tacos.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pizza is served in many restaurants around town.</strong></p>
