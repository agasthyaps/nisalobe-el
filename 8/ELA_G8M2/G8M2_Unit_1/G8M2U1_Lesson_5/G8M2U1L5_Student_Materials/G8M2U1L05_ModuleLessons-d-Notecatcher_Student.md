You are a member of the student council and you are writing a proposal to try to convince the school cafeteria to serve pizza two days a week, instead of just one. You are collecting evidence to put in your proposal.

1.  Sort the evidence on the sentence strips into two piles: evidence that is relevant to the topic, and evidence that is irrelevant to the topic.

2.  Glue the strips into the chart below.

3.  Discuss your sorted evidence with another partner group.
