**  
Directions:** Answer the questions about this section of text.

1.  Which of the following pieces of evidence, if the author chose to include it, would be irrelevant to the author’s claim? (RI.8.8)

2.  Guidelines for establishing and operating broiler chicken processing plants are overseen by the USDA and help regulate the treatment of chickens.

3.  The US population is steadily increasing, which means more eggs need to be produced. The average American eats about 250 eggs each year.

4.  More consumers are seeking out organic chicken each year because of their concerns about animal welfare, health, and the environment, which requires industrial organic farms to increase production.

5.  The USDA states that all chicken labeled organic means that it must be free-ranging and naturally raised, which includes being fed an organic diet.

6.  On page 149 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Michael Pollan writes: “Compared to conventional chickens, I was told, these organic birds have it pretty good.”

How does Pollan respond to this conflicting viewpoint that industrial organic chickens live in “pretty good” conditions? (RI.8.6)

7.  by referencing specific practices of raising conventional chickens

8.  by referencing research findings about the impacts of industrial chicken farming on the environment

9.  by referencing the fact that these birds are packed together and never actually go outside

10. by referencing research findings about the advantages of increased grazing areas for chickens
