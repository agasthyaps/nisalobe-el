<p><strong>Responses will vary, but may include:</strong></p>
<p><strong>“The machinery can turn a chicken from a clucking, feathered bird into a shrink-wrapped pack of parts in just ten minutes” (149).</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Twenty thousand is a lot of chickens. Inside the shed they formed a moving white carpet that stretched nearly the length of a football field” (149).</strong></p>

<td>Sufficient Evidence</td>
<td><p>Is the evidence presented in this text section sufficient? Why or why not? (RI.8.8)</p>
<p><strong>Responses will vary, but may include: The evidence presented in this section is sufficient because it presents enough information that helps the reader understand more about the reality of industrial organic farm practices. Michael Pollan shares evidence on the reality of organic chickens and how they are grown and processed rapidly. It makes the reader consider aspects of industrial organic farming practices that are only slightly better than industrial practices, which helps them understand that the claim Pollan presents makes sense.</strong></p></td>

<td>Sound Reasoning</td>
<td><p>Is the reasoning shared in this text section sound? Why or why not? (RI.8.8)</p>
<p><strong>Responses will vary, but should show understanding of the author’s reasoning. Sample response: The reasoning in this text section is sound. The evidence is relevant and sufficient and the sentences are tied together logically so the reader can follow the author’s thinking. For example, on pages 147–148 of the text, Pollan presents evidence about the reality of industrial organic chicken farms. He explains this evidence and uses it to support the point that even with labels like “free range,” many organic chickens live in factory farm conditions. This reasoning helps the reader connect the ideas presented about industrial organic farming practices back to the claim about industrial organic farming only being slightly better than industrial farming.</strong></p></td>

**Directions:** Answer the questions about this section of text.

1.  Which of the following pieces of evidence, if the author chose to include it, would be irrelevant to the author’s claim? (RI.8.8)

2.  Guidelines for establishing and operating broiler chicken processing plants are overseen by the USDA and help regulate the treatment of chickens.

3.  <u>The US population is steadily increasing, which means more eggs need to be produced. The average American eats about 250 eggs each year.</u>

4.  More consumers are seeking out organic chicken each year because of their concerns about animal welfare, health, and the environment, which requires industrial organic farms to increase production.

5.  The USDA states that all chicken labeled organic means that it must be free-ranging and naturally raised, which includes being fed an organic diet.

6.  On page 149 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Michael Pollan writes: “Compared to conventional chickens, I was told, these organic birds have it pretty good.”

How does Pollan respond to this conflicting viewpoint that industrial organic chickens live in “pretty good” conditions? (RI.8.6)

7.  by referencing specific practices of raising conventional chickens

8.  by referencing research findings about the impacts of industrial chicken farming on the environment

9.  <u>by referencing the fact that these birds are packed together and never actually go outside</u>

10. by referencing research findings about the advantages of increased grazing areas for chickens
