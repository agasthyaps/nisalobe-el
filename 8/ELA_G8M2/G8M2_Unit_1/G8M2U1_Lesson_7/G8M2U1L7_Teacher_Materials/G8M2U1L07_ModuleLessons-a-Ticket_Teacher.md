**Directions:** As you enter class, respond to the following prompts.

In the space below, write down one or two quotes from this section that stand out to you about the birth of organic food.

Responses will vary, but may include:

“The word *organic* has become a kind of shorthand for food that is healthier or more natural or chemical-free” (130).

“Once upon a time all food was ‘organic’” (131).

“The first Earth Day was held in April 1970. And the idea of organic food began to catch on” (132).

“\[T\]he word *organic* meant more than a method of farming. It meant living in harmony with nature instead of trying to control it” (132).

Be ready to share your sentences with a peer.
