Homework: Delineate an Argument:  
*The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 5

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Answer the following questions about delineating arguments after rereading pages 133–134, 147–150, and 153–155 from chapters 10 and 11 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*.

1.  In chapter 11 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Michael Pollan implies the central claim that industrial organic food is better than industrially raised food, yet it still has negative impacts on human health and the environment. Select one supporting point for this claim. (RI.8.8)

<!-- -->

1.  Industrial organic food always tastes better than conventionally raised food.

2.  Research has proven that industrial organic food and industrial food use similar amounts of pesticides in their practices.

3.  Industrial organic food comes from farms that use factory farming practices.

4.  <u>Industrial organic food is better for you and the environment because it contains fewer pesticides than conventionally grown food.</u>

5.  What is one piece of relevant evidence that supports this point? (RI.8.8)

6.  <u>Chemicals from pesticides used on conventionally grown food have been proven to cause cancer.</u>

7.  Pesticide use became widespread in the 1950s, after chemicals used in World War II were found effective for pest control on crops.

8.  Very little research has been done to determine the effects of low levels of these poisons.

9.  More research on the herbicide Atrazine, and its effects on humans, is needed.

10. Read pages 158–159, and select another supporting point for this claim. (RI.8.8)

11. <u>Although better for the environment overall, industrial organic food still uses many fossil fuels, which have a negative impact on the environment.</u>

12. Industrial food systems strip the soil of nutrients, and therefore many foods of healthy compounds that used to exist in them.

13. Industrial organic food is produced with less energy and fossil fuels than any other food system.

14. Industrial organic farming is the most sustainable food system consumers can choose.

15. What two pieces of relevant evidence support this point? (RI.8.8)

16. Soils of industrial farms are often lifeless because the pesticide use strips them of compounds called polyphenols.

17. <u>Food can travel over 1,800 miles from the farm to your grocery store, and can sometimes come from foreign countries.</u>

18. <u>Most of the fossil fuels used in the food industry are for processing and transporting food, rather than growing it.</u>

19. Industrial organic farming uses fewer sustainable practices, like renewable energy, than any other food system.
