Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.8.1 – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket by citing evidence from the text.

- RI.8.8 – Work Time B: Students complete sections of the Delineate an Argument graphic organizer as they review and evaluate the argument and claims in section 5 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*.

- SL.8.3 – Closing and Assessment A: Students watch “Farmers Markets” and evaluate the speaker’s argument and claims in a discussion with peers.

- The Think-Pair-Share and Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocols are used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of the curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- In this lesson, students practice becoming effective learners while collaborating with partners as they learn how to delineate and evaluate arguments and analyze their validity. This will help students strengthen their reading and analysis skills and will make them better able to formulate their own opinions and arguments.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- In this lesson, students read excerpts from chapters 10 and 11 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*. Provide time for students to read and review the entire chapters with peers or individually.

- Invite students to research more about industrial organic farming to better understand details of farm operations, history, products, and impact. Students can share what they learn in small groups or with the class.

- Invite students to find additional texts and resources from conflicting viewpoints that center around the same topic as this lesson’s excerpts from *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* (industrial organic farming). Support students to identify where irrelevant evidence is presented or in identifying false statements and fallacious reasoning that may exist.

- Find additional interviews, speeches, or videos on industrial organic farming, and allow students to evaluate the speaker’s point of view, reasoning, and use of evidence and rhetoric. Help students identify any fallacious reasoning and point out any exaggerated or distorted evidence.

- Students can research any industrial organic farms that operate in your state or area. Encourage students to learn more about their operations, practices, and production.

- As appropriate for students, use the Delineate an Argument graphic organizer in Work Time B and Closing and Assessment A with less or more scaffolding.

- In Closing and Assessment A, students view “Farmers Markets” from *Nourish: Short Films: 54 Bite-Sized Videos about the Story of Your Food*. Alternatively, the video can be accessed online at http://eled.org/0234. Then they discuss the argument presented and the supporting points and evidence. Invite students to fill out the optional Delineate an Argument: “Farmers Markets” graphic organizer in addition to their discussion. Similarly, provide time for students to view an additional video of their choice from this site, and fill out a corresponding graphic organizer.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- This lesson applies work students completed previously in delineating arguments and analyzing soundness and relevancy of evidence. In this lesson, students work on these same skills with increased independence, leading up to working completely independently later in the module.

Support All Students

- Presenting learning targets in writing, orally, and, if possible, accompanied by symbols, will help students to understand the language within them. ▲

- Note that section 5 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* addresses the concept of organic food. Pollan explains that organic food is grown without pesticides or fertilizer chemicals but is grown in far-away farms and sold by chain stores like Whole Foods, rather than grown and sold locally like organic used to imply. He raises the question of whether organic food is worth the extra cost and implies that it may be because we do not know the long-term effects of pesticides and fertilizers in our food, especially for children. He also discusses free-range chickens and the reality that these chickens are actually raised confined and do not go outside—they may be fed to grow so quickly that they cannot even walk. Some students or their families may find these topics to be new, challenging, or upsetting depending on their own eating habits, knowledge, access, or other factors. These topics may also be challenging for students who live in food deserts where they may not have access to organic food. Allow for time to process and respond to these topics during individual, small group, or whole-class discussion, and reach out to families as needed. Use thoughtful, strategic pairings, and discuss what types of food are available or affordable in students’ own neighborhoods and communities.

- In Work Time A, provide choice in how students read the excerpt: some students may prefer to read independently and silently, while others (especially ELLs) may wish to read aloud in groups with peers and/or with support. Still others may wish to read silently for a few pages and then process with a group. This format of choice could potentially be built into the reading time within each lesson. ▲

- As in previous lessons, in Work Time A, present additional options for recording gist rather than just the sticky note, such as using a separate notebook, using a graphic organizer, using highlighters and annotating, or using a voice recorder. Give students options for expressing their understanding of gist (oral, written, drawing). Also, build in different options for expressing comprehension of the text (written reflection, voice recording, discussion with partners/groups). ▲

- Students may need additional support with recording their answers on their graphic organizer in Work Time B. Sit those students in a group together to grow their independence with identifying the arguments and evidence with support when necessary. ▲

- When grouping students in partners to review the Delineate an Argument graphic organizer in Work Time B, group ELLs with partners who have more advanced or native language proficiency. The partners with greater language proficiency can serve as a model, initiating discussions and providing implicit sentence frames, for example. Use the same grouping in future lessons if this grouping was successful. This will support students in building trust and becoming more comfortable and confident with their peers. ▲

- Provide students with a link to the video used in Closing and Assessment A through sites such as Google Classroom or similar means so they can review the content multiple times at their own pace instead of in the large group setting.

- If watching the videos in Closing and Assessment A presents complications, read the transcript from videos aloud (from the blog posts associated with each video).

- To support ELLs, this lesson uses repeated routines and protocols to support productive analysis and discussion. Students read an excerpt from *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* and delineate an argument. In addition to reading from the text, students also watch a video. Linguistic input from different types of media will benefit ELLs and help to reinforce essential concepts related to the topic of food production.

- ELLs may find it challenging to analyze an oral argument. When analyzing an argument in a text, students can refer back to information as needed. When analyzing an argument in a video, students will not have the opportunity to do so in the same way. Consider using English-language subtitles while showing the video to offer multiple forms of linguistic input.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6, 8.I.B.7, and 8.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- Check gist statements to ensure students are recording quick notes about what the text is mostly about.

- Monitor and collect students’ Delineate an Argument graphic organizers during Work Time B to ensure students are on the right track for capturing accurate main claims, supporting points, and related evidence on an increasingly independent and accurate level.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will go back to examining the structure of specific paragraphs in *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, analyzing how the structure of supporting paragraphs contributes to developing key ideas in the text. Students will again discuss the author’s point of view and examine how the author responds to or acknowledges conflicting evidence and viewpoints.

- Student will have one more lesson where they can practice delineating an argument and analyzing evidence prior to their mid-unit assessment.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.8.1 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As they arrive, students complete **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **1**, **Lesson** **7**.

- Prompt students to Turn and Talk about their answers once they have completed the entrance ticket.

- Cold Call on students to share out the quotes they identified by asking:

“What quotes stood out to you from the text excerpt? Why?” (Responses will vary.)

- With students’ support, review information about the history of organic food. Refer to the **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **1**, **Lesson** **7** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as needed, and answer any clarifying questions. Tell students that the section 5 reading they do today explains more about the growth of organic food and farming.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 5 (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same process as with previous lessons for students to read section 5 of ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma*** using the **Text** **Guide**: ***The*** ***Omnivore’s Dilemma*** (**for** **teacher** **reference**). Instruct students to read the sections independently, and support struggling students as needed. If students do not finish reading the sections within the allotted reading time, distribute **Synopsis**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma,*** **Section** **5** to each student to review the key details from the section. As time permits, have students identify the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary, reflect on their reading as they choose, and record the gist on **sticky** **notes** using the following resources as appropriate: **vocabulary** **logs**, **academic** **word** **wall**, and **Work** **to** **Become** **Effective** **Learners** **anchor** **chart**.

- After reading, direct students to find a partner and Think-Pair-Share about the gist they determined and discuss their reactions to this section of text:

“What is the gist of section 5?” (There are pros and cons to industrial organic food. Better than industrial farming methods. Industrial organic food is grown without chemicals. May use similar methods as factory farming.)

“What were some of your reactions to things the author talked about in section 5?” (Responses will vary, but may include surprise that industrial organic food is grown in large monoculture and industrial/factory-type farms, or frustration that the term *free-range* is misleading, etc.)

“What questions did this bring up for you?” (Responses will vary, but may mention questions about different labels such as “organic” and “free-range” and what regulations are implied by them, or questions around comparing working conditions between industrial organic farms and industrial farms, etc.)

- Allow time for questions, and address any misconceptions students have about these text sections.

- Distribute two sticky notes to each student, and prompt students to label one “pros” and the other “cons.” Direct students to think about what they have just read, reflecting on the pros (advantages or positives) and cons (disadvantages or negatives) of industrial organic food. Ask students to identify and capture aspects of industrial organic farming that are positive on one sticky note and aspects that are negative on the other note.

- Prompt students to Turn and Talk, showing their sticky notes to one another and discussing the following questions:

“What is one pro related to industrial organic farming?” (Responses will vary, but may reference that the food is grown without pesticides or chemicals, which makes it better for the environment, animals, and humans.)

“What is one con related to industrial organic farming?” (Responses will vary, but may reference that since the food is produced in an industrial setting, the practices of animal treatment and feeding may resemble those on factory farms and use large amounts of fossil fuels.)

- Use **equity** **sticks** to collect answers from the group, and discuss responses.

Work Time

B. Delineate Arguments: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 5 – RI.8.8 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can delineate and evaluate the argument in *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, assessing whether the reasoning is sound and the evidence is relevant and sufficient.”

- Display and distribute the **Delineate** **an** **Argument**: ***The*** ***Omnivore’s Dilemma***, **Section** **5** **graphic** **organizer**. Tell students that they will continue the work they started in Lesson 4 around identifying argument and analyzing evidence and reasoning, but instead of working on this as a class like they did last time, they will work in partners.

- Explain to students that before they dive in and delineate the argument from this section, they should pause and identify Michael Pollan’s point of view and purpose for writing this section of text. Instruct students to retrieve their copies of the **Author’s** **Purpose** **and** **Point** **of** **View**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma*** **note** - **catcher**, and invite them to Think-Pair Share:

“What is Michael Pollan’s point of view in this section of text?” (Michael Pollan believes that industrial organic farming practices are far removed from the original intent behind the organic food movement. He thinks industrial organic farming is better than industrial farming practices, but only slightly better.)

“What is Michael Pollan’s purpose for writing this section of text?” (Michael Pollan writes this section to inform people about some of the realities of industrial organic farming practices.)

- Direct partners to read the first question from the Delineate an Argument: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 5 graphic organizer aloud together, discussing the choices presented for the main claim of this section of text. Use a total participation technique to share out student responses:

“What is the main claim of this text?” (Students should identify the correct response from the choices: “Industrial organic food is only a partial improvement over industrially produced food.”)

- Ask students to identify how they selected this main claim from the choices provided and share out responses to the group, encouraging them to reference the **Strategies** **to** **Answer** **Selected** **Response** **anchor** **chart** in their response. Note any high-leverage strategies that students used to select the claim.

- Remind students about the purpose Pollan had in writing this section of text on industrial organic farming, and prompt them to think about how understanding the purpose can help a reader determine the claim.

- Invite partners to preview the rest of the Delineate an Argument: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 5 graphic organizer together, making sure to note for students that some questions are selected response and some require constructed responses. Remind students that their task is to identify supporting points that align to this claim, determine evidence that is relevant, analyze the sufficiency of evidence and the soundness of reasoning, and note how Pollan acknowledges conflicting viewpoints.

- Direct students to review the Work to Effective Learners anchor chart, and prompt them to identify a goal they have regarding effective collaboration for the remainder of this work time. Field any questions students have about the task, and prompt them to complete the graphic organizer with their partner.

- As students work, circulate and use the **Delineate** **an** **Argument**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma***, **Section** **5** **graphic** **organizer** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as needed. Ensure students have named the correct supporting points, are identifying relevant evidence accurately, and are analyzing the soundness of reasoning used by Pollan in this section of text. Pull small groups of students who may need more guidance selecting supporting evidence. As needed, work with students on the final section of the note-catcher on soundness of reasoning.

- Display the example response for the sufficient evidence question from the Delineate an Argument: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 5 graphic organizer (example for teacher reference). Cold-call on one student to read the response aloud. Explain to students that this is a model response because it names whether or not there is enough evidence and explains how that evidence connects to the claim. Direct students to Think-Pair-Share with their partner:

“How is the example response similar to or different from your response?” (Responses will vary, but should name how their own response names (or does not name) the sufficiency of the evidence and comments on how the evidence connects to the claim.)

- Focus students on the example response for sound reasoning on the Delineate an Argument: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 5 graphic organizer (example for teacher reference). Cold-call on one student to read it aloud. Explain to students that this is a model response because it describes how the writer used connected sentences to describe the evidence and relate it to the supporting points, while also helping the reader connect the evidence to the main claim in order to see its validity. Direct students to Think-Pair-Share with their partner:

“How is the example response similar to or different to your response?” (Responses will vary, but should describe how their own response names (or does not name) the soundness of reasoning in this section of text.)

- Prompt students to return to their pro and con sticky notes, adding any new information to each note and saving them for use in Closing and Assessment A.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Closing and Assessment

A. Delineate an Argument: “Farmers Markets” Video – SL.8.3 (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can delineate a speaker’s argument and specific claims, evaluating the soundness of the reasoning and relevance and sufficiency of the evidence and identifying when irrelevant evidence is introduced.”

- Explain to students that they will now practice delineating arguments and identifying relevant evidence from a video instead of a text. Give students a moment to think about how it might be different to do this work with a video, and then direct students to Turn and Talk:

“What strategies might help you determine the argument, points, and relevant evidence as you watch the video?” (Responses will vary, but may include jotting down notes, watching the video multiple times, talking with a partner, etc.)

- Tell students that the video they will watch today is on farmers markets. Although this video is not directly related to their reading from today’s excerpt from the anchor text, it presents an important argument on the topic of food choices that they will analyze.

- Project the video, and explain to students that they will watch the video through one time for gist before trying to delineate the argument. Begin watching the **Video**: “ **Multiple Voices: Farmers Markets”** together. As it ends, prompt students to discuss the gist of the video with their partners.

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

What is the gist of the video?” (Farmers markets provide healthy food to a community and support local farmers.)

- Play the video one more time, prompting students to be thinking about the main claim, supporting points, and evidence presented. Make sure students know they will need to be particularly careful as they watch the video for a second time and determine the claim and use the strategies they mentioned earlier. Invite students to fill out the optional **Delineate an Argument: “Farmers Markets” graphic organizer** prior to their discussion.

- Prompt students to join with a partner, and lead them through the following series of questions. Use the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol, and prompt students to find a new partner after each question given below.

“What is the purpose in the video we just watched?” (The speaker hopes to inform viewers of the importance of farmers markets.)

“How can understanding this purpose help you identify the speaker’s claim?” (Responses will vary, but may include: knowing the purpose helps viewers narrow down and identify the claim because they know the speaker’s intention.)

“What is the main claim of this video?” (Responses will vary, but may include: it is important to support farmers markets in your local community.)

“What is one supporting point for this claim?” (Responses will vary, but may include: shopping at farmers markets helps support the farmers that bring communities good, wholesome, clean foods.)

“Name one piece of supporting evidence.” (Responses will vary, but may include: “It’s about having a relationship and taking responsibility for your food.”; “There’s so much opportunity for us to really acknowledge and honor the people who grow good, clean, whole foods and bring them to us.”; “I know that when I show up at the farmers market . . . my dollar is basically going back to the farmer who grew the food.”; “We are helping to strengthen our local economy, supporting our neighbors.”; or “It’s up to us to ensure that farmers can continue to do the work that they do and provide us with the fresh, healthy, local food that we all deserve.”)

“Is the evidence presented in this video relevant and sufficient?” (Responses will vary, but may include: The evidence presented in this video is related to the claim and is sufficient to help viewers consider shopping at farmers markets because the speakers bring up evidence connected to the claim. However, the evidence presented is not sufficient to convince someone to shop at farmers markets. Consumers would need to know more specific facts or details, like how much more do specific products cost at a farmers market, or exactly what profits the local farmers get, in order to be convinced to shop at farmers markets.)

- Explain to students that they will watch more of these videos during this unit as they learn to delineate and evaluate a speaker’s claims. Many of the videos have a similar purpose—to inform their audience about a particular topic related to farming, health, and food choices. Although the videos do present a claim that is supported by some evidence, these short videos are not long enough to have a fully developed argument, and because of this, the reasoning offered will be minimal. Students should keep this in mind as they complete graphic organizers in future lessons while watching videos.

- As time permits, direct students to review their Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 7 and discuss any similarities and differences between farmers markets and the original concept of organic food they read about in Opening A with their partner.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- As students watch Video: “Multiple Voices: Farmers Markets,” encourage them to generate a list of unfamiliar vocabulary that they hear while watching. After watching the video for the first time, allow students to work in groups to determine the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary before viewing for a second time.

For Heavier Support

- Print a transcript of the video for students to annotate while viewing. This will allow students to refer back to the information provided while delineating an argument. For the heaviest support, provide a translated version of the transcript for students to compare to the English-language version to help deepen understanding of the content.

Homework
