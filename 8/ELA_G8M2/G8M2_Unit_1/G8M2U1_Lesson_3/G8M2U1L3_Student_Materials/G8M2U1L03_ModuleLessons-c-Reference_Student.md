- Farmers used to grow their own seeds, but now seeds are genetically modified.

- Plants have certain weaknesses in the growing process, like being destroyed by pests or disease.

- To solve this problem and grow crops faster, seed companies modify the DNA of seeds by adding certain qualities from one plant to another. For example, if one plant is resistant to disease, scientists take that resistant trait from that plant and place it in the seed of a plant that is not resistant, so it can last until harvest.

- GMO seeds are patented by agribusiness. This means that they are the only ones who can produce and sell these seeds.

- In order for farmers to compete with other farmers for business, they have to keep buying GMO seeds from these corporations.

- Although farms in America are more productive than they’ve ever been, farmers do not make much money.

- The cost to buy corn is lower than the cost to grow it. As a result, farmers actually lose money.

- The government only gives subsidies to grow corn. Therefore, farmers cannot make much money from growing crops other than corn.
