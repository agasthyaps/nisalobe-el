Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.8.6 – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket on the function of a paragraph.

- RI.8.6 – Work Time A: Students read section 2 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* and determine the author’s purpose and point of view.

- RI.8.5 – Work Time B: Students analyze paragraph structures and how sentences in paragraphs develop key concepts in the text.

- RI.8.5 – Closing and Assessment A: Students answer questions focused on paragraph structure in Section 2 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* on an exit ticket.

- The Think-Pair-Share and Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocols are used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of the curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Students could read chapters 1, 2, and 3 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* and analyze the author’s point of view on other topics in the text.

- Students can conduct an internet search on the ingredients derived from corn mentioned on page 19 (e.g., MSG, glucose syrup, xanthan gum).

- Students can conduct an internet search to find more information about farmers and agribusinesses. They can locate short videos, interviews, and articles about the profits from industrial farming and the impact on farmers. Students can then write a reflection on their own point of view on agribusiness.

- Students may find more information about Monsanto and conflicting viewpoints about their GMO seeds and share this in small groups or with the whole class. Students can then participate in an organized discussion (e.g., Socratic Seminar) to exchange ideas about their research findings and opinions.

- If time permits, have students analyze the way the author implies that the integrity of seed companies is questionable. Display the Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart to review *integrity*, and ask:

“How do you think the author feels about agribusiness?” (It is not fair that seed companies profit while farmers struggle to feed their families.)

“The author describes how farmers only receive government subsidies to grow corn, but corn is sold for less than the cost to grow the crop. What do you think the author feels is the ‘right’ thing to do?” (Responses will vary, but may include: offer more subsidies to farmers, lower the price of GMO seeds, offer subsidies to grow other crops.)

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students analyzed the author’s purpose and point of view in *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*. In this lesson, students continue this work, as well as analyze paragraph structures and how they develop key concepts in the text.

- Students also answer selected response questions on the author’s purpose and point of view for homework, which builds upon their learning in the previous lesson.

Support All Students

- Note that section 2 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* brings up the idea that there is corn in most processed food that people eat, hidden within the ingredient lists. It notes that because of government subsidies, the price of corn stays cheap and farmers make less money, leading to bigger farms with fewer farmers and other effects, such as more fertilizer being used. It also brings up the concept of genetically modified organisms, or GMOs, and the fact that some people believe these are dangerous to consume. Some students and their families may have differing opinions from what Pollan suggests or may find these topics new or challenging based on their own knowledge and eating or shopping habits. Allow for time to process and respond to these topics during individual, small group, or full class discussion, and reach out to families as needed. Use thoughtful strategic pairing for discussions around these topics to ensure that all students feel comfortable.

- In Work Time A, provide choice in how students read the excerpt: some students may prefer to read independently and silently, while others (especially ELLs) may wish to read aloud in groups with peers and/or with support. Still others may wish to read silently for a few pages and then process with a group. This format of choice could potentially be built into the reading time within each lesson. ▲

- As in previous lessons, in Work Time A, present additional options for recording gist rather than just the sticky note, such as using a separate notebook, using a graphic organizer, using highlighters and annotating, or using a voice recorder. Give students options for expressing their understanding of gist (oral, written, drawing). Also, build in different options for expressing comprehension of the text (written reflection, voice recording, discussion with partners/groups). ▲

- Students may need support in understanding the concept of GMOs and hybrid plants. Consider showing images or videos to provide visual examples of how scientists use technology to create these seeds. It may also benefit students to see before and after images of original foods and the hybrid foods that result from genetic engineering to better understand this process. ▲

- When pairing students to answer selected and constructed response questions in Closing and Assessment A, group ELLs with partners who have more advanced or native language proficiency. The partners with greater language proficiency can serve as a model, initiating discussions and providing implicit sentence frames, for example. Use the same pairing in future lessons if this pairing is successful. This will support students in building trust and becoming more comfortable and confident with their peers. ▲

- In later grades, students will analyze how an author’s ideas or claims are refined by particular sentences, paragraphs, or larger portions of a text. Students might choose a longer text, perhaps the entirety of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, and write an analysis of how the author uses longer portions of text to refine his argument.

- In high school, students will analyze how an author or speaker uses rhetoric to advance that point of view or purpose. Students might analyze the use of rhetoric (the art of effective or persuasive speaking or writing, especially the use of figures of speech and other compositional techniques) within *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*.

- To support ELLs, this lesson follows a similar structure to that of the previous lesson. Students engage in supported in-class reading of the anchor text, *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, and answer selected and constructed response questions about the author’s purpose and point of view. Students also participate in a mini lesson on paragraph structure to consider how different types of paragraphs are used to present information within a text. This work will help to prepare students for the upcoming Mid-Unit 1 Assessment.

- ELLs may find it challenging to distinguish between different types of paragraphs, as this requires attention to nuance and the relationship between language usage and an author’s intention. Support students by breaking down paragraphs as much as possible to consider the intended meaning of each sentence. Encourage students to discuss the particular strategies they employ for determining types of paragraphs, author’s purpose, and elements of an argument.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6, 8.I.B.7, 8.I.B.8, and 8.II.B.4.

Assessment Guidance

- As students work in pairs to answer selected response questions in Closing and Assessment A, listen to student discussions to determine how close students are to understanding how to answer questions related to RI.8.5 to determine any common issues that could be used as teaching points for the whole group.

- Check student vocabulary logs for accountability in recording vocabulary.

- Check gist statements to ensure students are recording quick notes about what the text is mostly about.

- Review students’ exit tickets after the lesson to identify common issues in analyzing structure to use as teaching points for upcoming lessons on structure. See the Exit Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 3 (answers for teacher reference).

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue reading *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*. They will also delineate and evaluate the arguments in the text, assessing whether the reasoning is sound and the evidence is relevant and sufficient.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.8.6 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **1**, **Lesson** **3**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

- With students’ support, record the meanings of *conflicting* *viewpoint* (a perspective that is different from or disagrees with another; the opposition), *concept* (a big idea), and *structure* (the way in which the parts of something are arranged or organized) from the learning target to the **academic** **word** **wall**, with translations in students’ home languages. Write synonyms or sketch a visual above the words to scaffold students’ understanding.

- Invite students to record the words in their **vocabulary** **logs**. Prompt students to use the words in new sentences by either writing these sentences down or thinking of these sentences silently, then sharing with a partner. Add any relevant notes to the vocabulary strategies on the **Close** **Readers** **Do** **These** **Things** **anchor** **chart**.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- After students complete the entrance ticket, help them to refine their understanding of what a paragraph is and does by engaging the class in a discussion of the characteristics of paragraphs. Provide the following questions to help guide thinking:

- How many sentences are usually in a paragraph? (anywhere from two to ten)

- Why do writers use paragraphs? (to organize information in a way that helps the reader follow his or her ideas)

- How do writers decide when to begin a new paragraph? (when they are moving on to discuss a new topic, theme, or idea)

Work Time

A. Read *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 2, and Analyze Purpose and Point of View – RI.8.6 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze the author’s purpose and point of view in a text and explain how he acknowledges conflicting viewpoints.”

- Invite students to retrieve their copies of ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma*** and reread the gist they recorded for section 1.

- Instruct students to turn to page 17.

- Read aloud section 2 as students read along silently. Refer to the **Text** **Guide**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma*** (**for** **teacher** **reference**) for excerpt, questions, and vocabulary. If students are able to read independently or in small groups, group students accordingly, and set the time for them to read the excerpt. If students do not finish reading the section within the allotted reading time, distribute **Synopsis**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma***, **Section** **2** to each student to review the key details from the section.

- After reading the section, ask students to Think-Pair-Share about the gist they determined for the section of text:

“What is the gist of this section?” (Agribusinesses make major profits from farming.)

- Invite students to record the gist onto a **sticky** **note**, sticking it at the front of the chapter for quick reference. Alternatively, give students a different option for recording gist, such as writing a margin note or using a graphic organizer that they will return to in the future.

- Guide students to form partners to engage in the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol on the following questions:

“What is your reaction to the information in this excerpt?” (Responses will vary but may include: shock, disgust, disappointment, or interest in agribusiness, GMOs, corn.)

“What are you interested to learn more about now?” (Responses will vary, but may include: how corn is in most of our food, how GMOs are made, the lives of farmers.)

“When you go to the supermarket, what do you usually focus on?” (Responses will vary, but may include: locating my favorite foods, the price of foods.)

“How might this new information about our food change what you focus on in the supermarket?” (Responses will vary, but may include: focus on the ingredients or nutrition facts or GMO label.)

- Display the **Author’s** **Purpose** **and** **Point** **of** **View**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma*** **note** - **catcher**, and instruct students to retrieve their copies.

- Have students turn to page 49. Reread “The High Price of Cheap Corn.”

- Draw students’ attention to the following sentence:

“Doesn’t it produce cheap food for the American people?”

- Ask:

“Why do you think the author addresses the importance of ‘cheap food’ for the public?” (to point out that people want to pay less for food, people want cheap food)

- Using **equity** **sticks**, call on students and ask the following questions from the note-catcher:

“What topic is the author addressing?” (source of cheap food)

“What is the author’s attitude toward this topic?” (The cheap food Americans pay for is not cheap at all because their taxes pay for it through subsidies.)

“What is the author’s reason for writing this?” (to educate readers about the hidden costs in agribusiness and how it affects farmers)

“What words or ideas from the excerpt helped you determine that point of view?” (*problem, but, don’t really*)

“How does the author’s point of view add to our understanding of this topic?” (helps us understand why farmers do not make a lot of money from their crops)

- As students share, record their responses on the displayed Purpose and Point of View: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* note-catcher. Instruct students to follow along and record responses on their own note-catchers. Refer to **Author’s** **Purpose** **and** **Point** **of** **View**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma*** **note** - **catcher** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Remind students that they defined the term *conflicting* *viewpoint* (a perspective that is different from or disagrees with another; the opposition) in Opening A. Ask a volunteer to reread the definition aloud.

- Explain to students that the author introduces his viewpoint in the text, and, sometimes, the author may respond to a conflicting viewpoint as well.

- Ask:

“Why would the author address a conflicting viewpoint?” (The author anticipates where the reader might disagree and wants to provide additional evidence or reasons to support his point. The author knows that the reader might have a different opinion and wants to respond.)

“How does addressing a conflicting viewpoint help the author support his own thinking?” (It gives the author a chance to explain why he disagrees with the conflicting viewpoint.)

- Draw students’ attention to the following sentence:

“Your soft drink and hamburger may be cheaper, but that’s because taxpayers have already paid for part of it.”

- Ask:

“What is the conflicting viewpoint that is addressed in this section?” (Cheap corn produces cheap food for Americans.)

“How does the author respond to the conflicting viewpoint?” (by pointing out that food is not actually cheap because American taxes pay for the government subsidies used to produce the cheap corn)

- As students share, record their responses at the bottom section of the displayed Purpose and Point of View: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* note-catcher, under “Conflicting Viewpoint.” Note the page number and topic, the viewpoint the author addresses, and the author’s conflicting viewpoint. Instruct students to follow along and record responses on their own note-catchers. Refer to Author’s Purpose and Point of View: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* note-catcher (example for teacher reference).

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time A, as students read section 2 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, have them stop after each paragraph to paraphrase the information they have read. This will help to build comprehension, while also giving students the opportunity to practice paraphrasing and speaking skills.

Work Time

B. Mini Lesson: Analyze Paragraph Structure – RI.8.5 (20 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify the structure of a specific paragraph in a text and how it develops a key concept.”

- Using equity sticks, call on a student, and ask:

“What do you think you will look at when you analyze paragraph structure in a text?” (the way the paragraph is put together, the organization of sentences, relationship between sentences)

- Explain to students that the structure of paragraphs is purposeful and that sentences within paragraphs help develop an idea. Remind students that when they write, they structure their paragraphs to support their points. Throughout *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, students will analyze the structure of paragraphs and how these structures help develop key ideas in the text.

- Display the **Paragraph** **Structure** **anchor** **chart**.

- Explain to students that there are many types of paragraphs, but they will focus on four types: Compare/Contrast, Descriptive, Narrative, and Expository/Explanatory.

- Focus students on Part I of the anchor chart. Read aloud or ask volunteers to read aloud each paragraph type and definition.

- With students’ support, record the meanings of *compare* / *contrast* *paragraph* (paragraph that analyzes similarities and differences), *descriptive* *paragraph* (paragraph that describes something using sensory language or an observation of details), *narrative* *paragraph* (paragraph with a story sequence), and *expository* / *explanatory* *paragraph* (paragraph that explains a topic) on the **domain** - **specific** **word** **wall**, with translations in students’ home languages. Write synonyms or sketch a visual above the words to scaffold students’ understanding. Invite students to record these words in their vocabulary logs.

- Focus students on Part II of the anchor chart.

- Inform students that they will practice identifying types of paragraphs. They will also start to identify key concepts introduced by these paragraphs and sentences that develop those key concepts.

- Instruct students to turn to page 11. Focus students on paragraph 1. Ask a volunteer to reread the paragraph.

- Ask:

“What type of paragraph is this?” (compare/contrast)

“How do you know this is a compare/contrast paragraph?” (It compares/contrasts food traditions and Modern American experts on food.)

- As students share, record their responses in the second column, “Type of Paragraph.” See the **Paragraph** **Structure** **anchor** **chart** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Read aloud the selected sentence from this paragraph in the third column of the Paragraph Structure anchor chart. Explain that the sentence develops the concept that people do not know where our food comes from, which creates the “omnivore’s dilemma.”

- Instruct students to turn to page 17. Focus students on paragraph 2. Ask a volunteer to reread the paragraph.

- Ask:

“What type of paragraph is this?” (descriptive)

“How do you know this is a descriptive paragraph?” (It is a description of a supermarket.)

- As students share, record their responses in the second column, “Type of Paragraph.” See the Paragraph Structure anchor chart (example for teacher reference).

- Using equity sticks, call on a student, and ask:

“What sensory language does the author use to describe a supermarket?” (“shelves piled high,” “look again,” “brightly colored,” “mountain of corn”)

“What is the purpose of the author using this sensory language?” (to create a mental image for the reader)

- Read aloud the selected sentence from this paragraph in the third column of the Paragraph Structure anchor chart. Explain that the sentence appeals to the sense of sight to help readers imagine what the supermarket looks like and how most foods contain corn.

- Instruct students to turn to page 34. Focus students on paragraph 1. Ask a volunteer to reread the paragraph.

- Ask:

“What type of paragraph is this?” (narrative)

“How do you know this is a narrative paragraph?” (It tells a story about George’s grandfather.)

- As students share, record their responses in the second column, “Type of Paragraph.” See the Paragraph Structure anchor chart (example for teacher reference).

- Tell students that this paragraph uses sequence to tell a brief story of the author’s food investigation.

- Using equity sticks, call on a student, and ask:

“Which words or terms in this paragraph indicate that there is a sequence of events?” (“the very beginning,” “first,” and “then”)

- Read aloud the selected sentence from this paragraph in the third column of the Paragraph Structure anchor chart. Explain that the sentence develops the idea of the author working as a food detective by providing the reader with the history of farmers and seeds.

- Instruct students to turn to page 35. Focus students on paragraph 3. Ask a volunteer to reread the paragraph.

- Ask:

“What type of paragraph is this?” (expository/explanatory)

“How do you know this is an expository/explanatory paragraph?” (It gives information about hybrid corn.)

- As students share, record their responses in the second column, “Type of Paragraph.” See the Paragraph Structure anchor chart (example for teacher reference).

- Read aloud the selected sentence from this paragraph in the third column of the Paragraph Structure anchor chart. Explain that the sentence provides data to inform the reader about hybrid corn plants.

- Using equity sticks, call on a student, and ask:

“How do statistics help develop an expository/explanatory paragraph?” (They help us measure information using numbers and understand how much something is affected.)

- If productive, use a Goal 2 Conversation Cue to encourage students to listen carefully to one another and seek to understand the paragraph structure of this excerpt from *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*:

“Who can tell us what your classmate said in your own words?”

“Can you give an example?”

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- After the mini lesson on paragraph structure in Work Time B, invite students to look for other examples of the different types of paragraphs. Students can share their examples with the group and work together to use the criteria generated on the paragraph structure anchor chart to explore the structure of each one.

Closing and Assessment
