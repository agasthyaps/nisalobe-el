Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.8.5 – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket analyzing paragraph structure.

- RI.8.5 – Work Time A: Students analyze paragraph structures and how sentences in paragraphs develop key concepts in the anchor text.

- SL.8.1 – Closing and Assessment A: Students engage in a collaborative discussion about the structure of paragraphs in *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*.

- The Think-Pair-Share protocol is used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of the curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- In later grades, students will analyze how an author’s ideas or claims are refined by particular sentences, paragraphs, or larger portions of a text. Students might choose a longer text, perhaps the entirety of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, and write an analysis of how the author uses longer portions of text to refine his argument.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students analyzed paragraph structure in *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, and they continue structure analysis in this lesson.

Support All Students

- The Gallery Walk in Work Time A consists of stations in which students will read text from *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*. This activity is multimodal, providing visual, auditory, and kinesthetic access points to analyze paragraph structure. This will engage various types of learners in working toward their mastery of RI.8.5. ▲

- In Work Time A, students write their responses on one sheet of chart paper at each station. Instead of the one sheet, post two sheets of chart paper at each station, one for the paragraph and one for students to record their responses. Some students may benefit from this visual organization. Giving each group a different colored marker may also help students keep track of their group’s responses in the Gallery Walk and which stations they have visited and need to visit. ▲

- The directions to the Gallery Walk can be complex for some students. Displaying written directions to the Gallery Walk can help students with understanding, and students can refer to the directions throughout the activity. ▲

- Students may need a set amount of time at each station and a displayed visual/audio timer to help them keep track of the time they have at each station. Students may also benefit from verbal warnings so they may finish within the allotted time. ▲

- Creating a note-catcher, similar to the Paragraph Structure anchor chart, for students to keep track of various examples of paragraph types may help students with their analysis and may be used as a reference tool for students to review. ▲

- Students may need additional support collaborating with their peers during the Gallery Walk in Work Time A. Some students may struggle to share their ideas in their groups. Predetermine grouping to place struggling students in groups with the most peer support. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson builds upon work in previous lessons with paragraph structure. Students participate in a Gallery Walk to analyze different types of paragraphs. This activity helps students to continue to develop their understanding of the different ways that writers present information and how different types of paragraphs help writers to convey their points of view. The collaborative nature of the activity helps students to continue to build habits of character, and the opportunities for discussion promote oral skills development.

- ELLs may find it challenging to identify different types of paragraphs during the Gallery Walk activity. Encourage students to consider each sentence and to highlight and annotate as needed to help them work through the analysis required. When possible, allow students to engage in discussion in home-language groups to help them process the task and content with reduced linguistic interference.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6, 8.I.B.7, and 8.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- As students work in groups during the Gallery Walk activity, circulate to ensure students analyze the paragraph structures and understand how specific sentences contribute to the meaning of key concepts.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue reading *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, delineating and evaluating arguments in the text and assessing whether the reasoning is sound and the evidence is relevant and sufficient.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 9, and ensure there is a copy of it at each student’s workspace.

- Copy each of the following paragraphs from this lesson’s reading of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* and their citations onto four different sheets of chart paper, and post them around the room for the Gallery Walk in Work Time A:

- Paragraph 1 on page 169, from “Polyface Farm is the opposite of . . . ” through “ . . . from start to finish.”

- Paragraph 2 on pages 175–176, from “From the mix of green leaves . . . ” through “ . . . she can find.”

- Paragraph 3 on pages 178–179, from “Throwing and stacking fifty-pound bales . . . ” through “ . . . kept them from roaming.”

- Paragraph 4 on page 194, from “There’s one more secret . . . ” through “ . . . told me proudly.”

- Post the prompt questions students answer in the Gallery Walk in Work Time A.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous modules to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.8.5 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **1**, **Lesson** **9**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

- After students complete the entrance ticket, build in time for them to find other examples of narrative paragraphs in *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*. This will help students to continue to take notice of the structural characteristics of these types of paragraphs.

For Heavier Support

- After students complete the entrance ticket, build in time for them to discuss the structure of the paragraph on page 149 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* in detail. This will help students to take notice of the specific characteristics of the paragraph that make it descriptive.

Work Time

A. Gallery Walk: Paragraph Structure – RI.8.5 (30 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze the structure of a specific paragraph in a text and how it develops a key concept.”

- Remind students that they have had practice in analyzing paragraph structure in many of the previous lessons.

- Display the **Paragraph** **Structure** **anchor** **chart**, and have a volunteer review the definition of each paragraph type in Part I of the anchor chart.

- Explain to students that they will practice analyzing structure in a Gallery Walk. Point out that there are four different paragraphs around the room. Students will be split into four groups. There will be four rounds that each group will participate in to analyze an aspect of structure in all four paragraphs. For each paragraph, the group will respond to one of the following prompts:

<!-- -->

- “What type of paragraph structure does the author use?”

- “What is the key concept of this paragraph? Highlight or underline a sentence that develops this key concept.”

- “How does the quotation (sentence) contribute to developing the key concept?”

- “Why does the author include this paragraph, and what role does it play in the author’s overall purpose?”

<!-- -->

- Model the clockwise movement groups will use to move to each station. Consider visiting each station while explaining the directions.

- Use the following example to explain how students will move with their groups to each paragraph:

<!-- -->

- Group A will be assigned to paragraph 1, Group B to paragraph 2, Group C to paragraph 3, and Group D to paragraph 4.

- Round 1: Group A will visit and read paragraph 1 and identify the type of paragraph structure the author uses: Narrative, Expository, Descriptive, or Compare/Contrast.

While Group A is identifying paragraph 1’s type, Groups B, C, and D are identifying the paragraph type of the other three paragraphs around the room.

Group A moves to paragraph 2 while Group B moves to paragraph 3, Group C to paragraph 4, and Group D to paragraph 1.

- Round 2: Group A visits and reads paragraph 2. Group B already identified this paragraph type in Round 1. Group A reads their response. Group A will write a sentence identifying the key concept in the paragraph on the chart paper and identify a sentence in the paragraph that develops this key concept in the text. Students may underline or highlight the sentence on the chart paper.

Groups B, C, and D are also writing one sentence that identifies the key concept in the paragraph on their chart paper and underlining or highlighting a sentence in the paragraph that contributes to developing this key concept.

Group A moves to paragraph 3, while Group B moves to paragraph 4, Group C to paragraph 1, and Group D to paragraph 2.

- Round 3: Group A visits and reads paragraph 3. Group B already wrote a sentence identifying the key concept in the paragraph and identified a sentence in the paragraph that develops this key concept in the text in Round 2. Group C already identified the paragraph type in Round 1. Group A reads all that has been written so far. Now Group A will write a brief explanation of how the selected sentence develops the key concept. Refer students to the Paragraph Structure anchor chart as necessary.

Groups B, C, and D are also writing a brief explanation of how the selected sentence in their paragraphs develops the key concept.

Group A moves to paragraph 4, while Group B moves to paragraph 1, Group C to paragraph 2, and Group D to paragraph 3.

- Round 4: Group A visits and reads paragraph 4. Group D already identified the paragraph type in Round 1. Group C wrote a sentence identifying the key concept in the paragraph and identified a sentence in the paragraph that develops this key concept in the text in Round 2. Group B wrote a brief explanation of how the selected sentence develops the key concept in Round 3. Group A reads all that has been written so far. Now Group A will write a brief explanation of why the author includes this paragraph and what role it plays in the author’s overall purpose.

<!-- -->

- After explaining the directions, answer any clarifying questions.

- Organize students into four groups.

- Focus students on the **Work** **to** **Become** **Effective** **Learners** **anchor** **chart**. Remind students that it says at the top that effective learners are people who develop the mindsets and skills for success in college, career, and life.

- Ask a volunteer to read aloud the habit of character: “I collaborate. This means I can work well with others to accomplish a task or goal.”

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share to review the following questions:

“What does collaboration look like? What might you see when people are collaborating?” (See Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart.)

“What does collaboration sound like? What might you hear when people are collaborating?” (See Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart.)

- Explain to students that their learning in this activity requires everyone in the class to collaborate in order to be successful.

- Have Group A stand at paragraph 1, Group B stand at paragraph 2, Group C at paragraph 3, and Group D at paragraph 4.

- Instruct students to read the paragraph and identify the type of paragraph structure the author uses on the chart paper.

- When all groups have finished, signal for students to move clockwise to the next posted paragraph.

- Instruct students to read the new paragraph and what has been written so far. Then, they should write a sentence identifying the key concept in the paragraph on the chart paper. Students also identify a sentence in the paragraph that develops this key concept in the text.

- When all groups have finished, signal for students to move clockwise to the next posted paragraph.

- Instruct students to read the new paragraph and what has been written so far. Then, they should write a brief explanation of how the selected sentence develops the key concept.

- When all groups have finished, signal for students to move clockwise to the next posted paragraph.

- Instruct students to read the new paragraph and what has been written so far. Then, they should write a brief explanation of why the author includes this paragraph and what role it plays in the author’s overall purpose.

- Refocus the class, and instruct students to return to their seats.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- After the Gallery Walk, invite students to rewrite the paragraph they analyzed as a different type of paragraph (i.e., narrative to descriptive). This will help students to think carefully about the defining features of each type of paragraph and help them to consider how they can use a variety of paragraph types in their own writing.

For Heavier Support

- In advance of the Gallery Walk, annotate each paragraph to help direct students’ attention to characteristics that will help them determine the type. Students can also add further annotations as they analyze the paragraphs to help with processing.

Closing and Assessment

A. Whole-Class Share (10 minutes)

- Ask a volunteer from Group A to read aloud the analysis of paragraph 1:

“What type of paragraph structure does the author use?” (Compare/Contrast)

“What is the key concept of this paragraph?” (The author compares Polyface Farm and George Naylor’s and Earthbound farms.)

“Highlight or underline a sentence that develops this key concept” (“Their farms run like factories.”)

“How does the quotation (sentence) contribute to developing the key concept?” (This sentence contributes to developing the concept that Polyface Farm has a more natural farming process than the Naylor and Earthbound farms.)

“Why does the author include this paragraph, and what role does it play in the author’s overall purpose?” (This paragraph includes a description of an industrial farm to support the author’s point of view on local sustainability.)

- Ask a volunteer from Group B to read aloud the analysis of paragraph 2:

“What type of paragraph structure does the author use?” (Descriptive)

“What is the key concept of this paragraph?” (The author uses details to describe how a cow eats grass.)

“Highlight or underline a sentence that develops this key concept.” (“The cow opens her meaty wet lips, curls her sandpaper tongue around the bunched clover like a fat rope, and rips the mouthful of tender leaves from its crown.”)

“How does the quotation (sentence) contribute to developing the key concept?” (This sentence contributes to the developing concept that grass plays an important role in food production.)

“Why does the author include this paragraph, and what role does it play in the author’s overall purpose?” (This paragraph includes a description of a cow’s experience on a local farm to support the author’s point of view on how farm animals should be treated.)

- Ask a volunteer from Group C to read aloud the analysis of paragraph 3:

“What type of paragraph structure does the author use?” (Narrative)

“What is the key concept of this paragraph?” (The author tells a brief story of his experience working on Joel Salatin’s farm.)

“Highlight or underline a sentence that develops this key concept.” (“Then we sped up the rutted dirt road and soon bumped to a halt at the upper pasture.”)

“How does the quotation (sentence) contribute to developing the key concept?” (This sentence contributes to developing the concept that the farming process of local sustainability requires hard labor and long days of working on the farm.)

“Why does the author include this paragraph, and what role does it play in the author’s overall purpose?” (This paragraph includes a narrative to support the author’s respect for the hard work on local farms.)

- Ask a volunteer from Group D to read aloud the analysis of paragraph 4:

“What type of paragraph structure does the author use?” (Expository/Explanatory)

“What is the key concept of this paragraph?” (The author specifies the topic of corn feed for pigs and explains why it is important.)

“Highlight or underline a sentence that develops this key concept.” (“Because there’s nothing a pig enjoys more than getting tipsy on corn, and there’s nothing a pig is better equipped to do than root it out with his powerful snout and exquisite sense of smell.”)

“How does the quotation (sentence) contribute to developing the key concept?” (This sentence contributes to developing the concept that the farmer uses the nature of pigs for natural food production.)

“Why does the author include this paragraph, and what role does it play in the author’s overall purpose?” (This paragraph includes an example to support the author’s point of view on local farming.)

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.
