Mid-Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Structure, Determine Point of View, and Evaluate Arguments

(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** This assessment has two parts. In Part I, you will analyze the claim, points, and evidence presented by a speaker in a short video. In Part II, you read a new text and answer questions about the author’s purpose, claim, points, and evidence and analyze how the structure of particular paragraphs develops and refines key ideas about where our food comes from.

Part I: Analyze a Claim in a Video

**Directions:** Watch the video twice, then fill in the graphic organizer with information from the video and answer the questions that follow. (SL.8.3)

Part II: Analyze a Claim in a Text

**Directions:** Read the text excerpt about food additives. Then, fill in the missing parts of the graphic organizer and answer the questions that follow.

**Excerpt from *Chew on This* by Eric Schlosser and Charles Wilson**

Studies have found that the color of a food can influence the way people think it tastes. Brightly colored foods seem to taste better than bland-looking foods, even when their flavors are exactly the same. The color additives in children’s foods have become increasingly bold. According to IFF, kids are now drawn to outrageous colors and foods that change color in your mouth. Foods that are strawberry-flavored no longer need to be pink; grape-flavored foods don’t need to be purple. Bright blue and green colorings are quite popular, regardless of the food’s flavor. Boys are more likely than girls to try goods that are strangely colored (like purple French fries and purple ketchup) or foods that do strange things in your mouth (like Mega Warheads, which turn your tongue blue).

The popularity of unnatural colors, however, has led to accidental poisonings. Some laundry detergents and window-washing fluids are the same bright blue color as drinks such as Frost Gatorade. Small children have tried to drink these toxic liquids, thinking they will taste delicious. For thousands of years people could judge the safety of a food by its color. Foods that were dangerous or had gone bad often didn’t look right. If your red meat turned green or blue, you’d probably decide not to eat it. The widespread use of bold food coloring has made it harder to see if something’s wrong with your food. And some poisonous liquids, deliberately given unnatural colors so that nobody will drink them, now remind toddlers of their favorite drinks.

The US government claims that the color and flavor additives widely used in processed foods are safe. That may not always be the case. Carmine can cause allergic reactions in some people. Tartrazine, a yellow food coloring, can cause hyperactivity, headaches, rashes, and an increased risk of asthma in some children. It has been banned in Norway, Finland, and Austria but is still used by food companies in the United States and Great Britain. Tartrazine can be found in British and American sodas, candies, chewing gum, Jell-O<sup>TM</sup>, and butterscotch pudding mixes, among other things.

A number of scientists now worry that eating so many different chemicals in processed foods may not be good for young children. A study conducted in 2004 at the University of Southampton in England looked at the behavior of 277 children who were three to four years old. Over a series of weeks the researchers gave each child either a fruit drink or a drink made with artificial colors and flavors that tasted exactly the same. The kids never knew which drink they were getting. They seemed much more hyperactive when they had the drink full of artificial ingredients than when they had the fruit juice. Each of the widely used chemical additives may be safe to eat by itself, but the safety of eating a large combination of additives in every meal remains unknown. “We assume that because these things do not make us drop dead, they’re safe,” says Dr. Vyvyan Howard, a leading expert on toxic substances at the University of Liverpool in England. “It’s not true. In my opinion, I would recommend that kids just stay away from them.”
