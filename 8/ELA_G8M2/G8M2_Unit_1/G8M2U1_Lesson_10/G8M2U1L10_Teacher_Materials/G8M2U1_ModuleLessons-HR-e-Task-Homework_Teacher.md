Homework: Delineate Arguments:  
*The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Afterword

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Answer the following questions about delineating arguments after reading pages 323–328 from the afterword of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*. (RI.8.8)

1.  On page 323, Michael Pollan writes, “I suspect that reading this book will complicate your eating life.”

What is complicated about the choices we have to make regarding food? What does Pollan hope consumers will think about as a result of reading this book?

Responses will vary, but may include: Pollan acknowledges that learning more about our farming industries, and where our food comes from, presents dilemmas for consumers. Once you know about factory farming, or HFCS, for example, one has to make choices about whether or not to support the industries that create these products when you make the choice of whether or not to consume their products. He hopes that regardless of the conclusions readers come to regarding their food choices, they can now make choices that are more informed.

2.  What is the central claim of this section of text?

    1.  <u>Consumers can “vote with their fork” and help create a better world by making more sustainable food choices.</u>

    2.  Consumers should become vegetarians and stop eating meat in order to solve the “omnivore’s dilemma.”

    3.  Students should tell their schools to make better food choices in cafeterias.

    4.  All families should become informed consumers and change the way they are eating to veganism.

3.  What is one supporting point for this claim?

    1.  Fast food is a terrible choice for consumers to make. It harms the environment, animals, and human health.

    2.  <u>Making small choices, like eating meat from CSAs or drinking less soda, will have a positive impact on the environment, your health, and local farmers.</u>

    3.  Eating local foods and eating seasonally are the only ways to have a positive impact on farmers, your health, and the environment.

    4.  All people should make responsible food choices and eat a vegetarian diet consisting of food derived only from plants.

4.  On page 324, Michael Pollan writes, “But whatever conclusion readers come to, they are more thoughtful about their choices—they act now out of knowledge rather than ignorance, and that’s the most important thing.”

What does this statement mean to you? What conclusions about the “omnivore’s dilemma” are you making in your own life and in your own food choices?

Responses will vary, but may include: Having more information helps people feel knowledgeable and in control of the choices they make as consumers. Knowing where food comes from can impact what we buy, how we make up our diets, and what priorities we have when it comes to food. In my own personal life, I want to make food choices that rely on less industrial meat and will work to inform my family and help them see the negative impact of these products on the environment. I will also look for ways to support local farms and go to at least two farmers markets this summer to learn more about the local foods available in my area.
