5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

RI.8.6, L.8.1a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

When people know about their food, they **start considering quality and not just price.** (from page 216 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* by Michael Pollan)

**Lesson 10 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after students read the text in Work Time A.

Rationale

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target (**I can determine an author’s point of view and analyze how the author addresses conflicting evidence or viewpoints**) and RI.8.6 by presenting students with an opportunity to analyze the author’s point of view. This sentence also helps students to address L.8.1a by providing an opportunity to explain the function of a gerund phrase.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses a gerund phrase (**considering quality and not just price**) with the purpose of explaining the result of an action.

- Transfer: verb + gerund + \[object\] when writing an argument essay in Unit 3 of this module. Students will also transfer their knowledge of this structure when delineating arguments on the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **When people know about their food, they <u>start considering quality and not just price</u>.**

- Ask:

“What is the gist of this sentence?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **they start considering quality and not just price.**

- Ask:

“What action does this chunk tell us about?” (People begin prioritizing the quality of food over how much it costs.)

“What causes people to take this action? How do you know?” (Being informed about food. We know this from the information in the first clause in the sentence.)

- Underline start in red, and invite students to do the same on their note-catchers. 

- Ask:

“What is the direct object of the verb start?” (considering quality and not just price)

- Underline considering quality and not just price in blue, and invite students to do the same on their note-catchers. 

- Remind students that direct objects are nouns and that in the Language Dive in Lesson 2, they saw how an infinitive phrase could function as a noun and the direct object of a verb. Tell them that the phrase **considering quality and not just how much it costs** is a gerund phrase functioning as a noun. Gerunds are words that have the same form as **-ing** verbs but function as nouns. A gerund <u>phrase</u> is a phrase that begins with a gerund.

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **When people know about their food, they <u>start considering quality and not just price</u>.**

- Ask:

“What if we replace considering quality and not just price with an infinitive phrase?”  
(The meaning stays almost exactly the same. The verb start can be followed by a gerund or an infinitive, and the difference in meaning between the two is quite subtle. Using a gerund implies that the action will be ongoing and continuous, whereas an infinitive suggests it may be done only once.)

- Note: If necessary, remind students that an infinitive is formed with **to** + infinitive. For heavier support, display the infinitive phrase **to consider quality and not just price** to help students make the comparison.

“What does this sentence tell us about Michael Pollan’s point of view?” (It tells us he believes that the quality of food is important and that spending a bit more to get food that is of a higher standard is worth it.)

- Ask:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does this Mini Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target: I can determine an author’s point of view and analyze how the author addresses conflicting evidence or viewpoints?”(Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

> **After I finish my breakfast, I start \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**
>
> gerund phrase
>
> (gerund + \[object\] = gerund phrase)
>
> (verb + **-ing** = gerund)

- Say:

“Use this frame to talk about your morning routine in your own words with your partners.”

- Sample response:

> **After I finish my breakfast, I start <u>brushing my teeth</u>**.
>
> gerund phrase
>
> (gerund + \[object\] = gerund phrase)
>
> (verb + **-ing** = gerund)
