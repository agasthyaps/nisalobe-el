<p><strong>We should eat seasonally.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Eating seasonally is fun!”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“You get the opportunity to be creative. You go out, you go to the farmers market and you can taste, and it’s like a Sunday morning adventure. Then you come home and prepare this food, and it’s amazing!”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“The joy of eating seasonally is fresh produce.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>Responses will vary, but may include: The evidence presented in this video is related to the claim and is sufficient to help viewers consider eating locally; however, the evidence presented is insufficient to convince someone to eat seasonally.
