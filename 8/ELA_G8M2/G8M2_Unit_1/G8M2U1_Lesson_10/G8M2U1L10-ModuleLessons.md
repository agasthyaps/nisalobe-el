Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.8.8 – Work Time A: Students complete sections of their Delineate an Argument graphic organizer as they review and evaluate the argument and claims in section 7 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, noting evidence for each point and assessing whether the reasoning is sound and the evidence is relevant and sufficient.

- SL.8.3 – Closing and Assessment A: Students watch a video as they fill out their Delineate an Argument graphic organizer to analyze the speaker’s argument and claims, as well as evaluate the evidence presented for sufficiency and relevance.

- The Think-Pair-Share and Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocols are used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- In this lesson, students practice becoming effective learners as they collaborate while practicing how to delineate and evaluate arguments and analyze their validity. This will help students strengthen their reading and analysis skills, and will make them better able to formulate their own opinions and arguments.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- In this lesson, students read excerpts from chapters 16 and 17 as well as the Afterword of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*. Consider providing time for students to read and review the entire chapters with peers or individually.

- Invite students to find additional texts and resources from conflicting viewpoints that center around the same topic as this lesson’s excerpts from *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* (local food). Support students to identify where irrelevant evidence is presented, or in identifying false statements and fallacious reasoning that may exist.

- An optional Mini Language Dive, intended for use after students read *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* in Work Time A, is available in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Consider finding additional interviews, speeches, or video on local food and allowing students to evaluate the speaker’s point of view, reasoning, and use of evidence and rhetoric. Help students identify any fallacious reasoning and point out any exaggerated or distorted evidence.

- Invite students to research more about local, sustainable agriculture to better understand the details of its operations, history, and impact. Students can share what they learn in small groups or with the class.

- Students can research any local sustainable farms that operate locally. Encourage students to learn more about their operations, practices, and production, and reach out to farmers to see if an interview or visit is possible.

- As appropriate for students, consider using the Delineate an Argument graphic organizer in Work Time A and Closing and Assessment A with less, or more, scaffolding.

- In Closing and Assessment A, students view a video from *Nourish: Short Films: 54 Bite-Sized Videos about the Story of Your Food* and complete their Delineate an Argument in a Video graphic organizer. If there is time, allow students to view an additional video of their choice and fill out a corresponding graphic organizer.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Students have been working through a series of alternating lessons on structure and author’s point of view, and delineating and evaluating arguments. These lessons scaffolded the skills and tasks related to each standard. In this lesson, students continue this work on analyzing arguments, completing the tasks with independence.

Support All Students

- Presenting learning targets in writing, orally, and, if possible, accompanied by symbols, will help students to understand the language within them. ▲

- During Opening A, students engage in a series of questions to grapple with their understanding of local farms. Consider researching the answers to the questions and sharing with students to deepen their understanding of the local farming landscape in their particular geographical area.

- Note that section 6 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* presents Pollan’s and others’ perspective that shopping locally allows people to know where their food comes from, keeps money local, and helps them trust the quality of what they are eating. This excerpt also addresses the concept that people get what they pay for and that, as Americans learn more about their food, they may be more willing to spend more for quality food. Pollan brings up the idea of eating seasonally and the fact that this takes sacrifices to find out and eat what is growing, and that it is hard work to eat healthily and sustainably. Finally, he posits that grass-fed meat is better for humans than corn-fed. Some students or their families may find these topics to be new, challenging, or even frustrating depending on their own eating habits, knowledge, access, or other factors. This topic may also be challenging for students who live in food deserts where they may not have access to locally grown, seasonal, or grass-fed food. Allow for time to process and respond to these topics during individual, small group, or full class discussion, and reach out to families as needed. Use thoughtful strategic pairing for discussions, and consider having a discussion with students about what types of food are available or affordable in their own neighborhoods and communities.

- In Work Time A, provide choice in how students read the excerpt: some students may prefer to read independently and silently, while others (especially ELLs) may wish to read aloud in groups with peers and/or with support. Still others may wish to read silently for a few pages and then process with a group. This format of choice could potentially be built into the reading time within each lesson. ▲

- As in previous lessons, in Work Time A, present additional options for recording gist rather than just the sticky note, such as using a separate notebook, using a graphic organizer, using highlighters and annotating, or using a voice recorder. Give students options for expressing their understanding of gist (oral, written, drawing). Also, build in different options for expressing comprehension of the text (written reflection, voice recording, discussion with partners/groups). ▲

- Note there is a differentiated version of the Delineate an Argument: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 7 graphic organizer used in Work Time A in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Students may need additional support with recording their answers on their graphic organizer in Work Time A and Closing and Assessment A. As necessary, work with those students in a group to support independence as they identify the arguments and evidence. ▲

- Note there is a differentiated version of the Delineate an Argument in a Video graphic organizer used in Work Time B in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Consider using a preferred classroom routine to review the answers from their Delineate an Argument: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 7 graphic organizer with students in pairs or individually. ▲

- Provide students with links to the video used in Closing and Assessment A through such sites as Google Classroom or similar means so they can review the content multiple times at their own pace. ▲

- If watching videos in Closing and Assessment A presents complications, read transcripts from the videos aloud (from the blog posts associated with each video). ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson includes continued work with determining an author’s or speaker’s purpose and point of view and with delineating arguments and determining the relevance and sufficiency of evidence. Graphic organizers support students in tracking important information from the text and from two videos. Repeated routines and collaborative exchange are built into the lesson to help students work through the tasks at hand.

- ELLs may find it challenging to analyze an oral argument. When analyzing an argument in a text, students can refer back to information as needed. When analyzing an argument in a video, students will not have the opportunity to do so in the same way. Consider using English-language subtitles while showing the video to offer multiple forms of linguistic input.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6, 8.I.B.7, and 8.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- Check gist statements to ensure students are recording quick notes about what the text is mostly about.

- Monitor and collect students’ Delineate an Argument graphic organizers during Work Time A and Closing and Assessment A to ensure students are on the right track for capturing accurate main claims, supporting points, and related evidence on an increasingly independent and accurate level.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will complete their mid-unit assessment on author’s purpose, point of view, and structure, as well as analyzing the claim, points, and evidence presented in videos and texts.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (10 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As they arrive, students complete **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **1**, **Lesson** **10**.

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, direct them to find a partner, and guide students through a Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol, proceeding through as many questions as possible from the entrance ticket as time allows.

- With students’ support, share out what local foods or farms are available in the local community. Refer to the **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **1**, **Lesson** **10** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**). Tell students that in the reading they do today from section 7, they will learn more about local food.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 7, and Delineate Arguments – RI.8.8 (20 minutes)

- Review appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can delineate and evaluate the argument in *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, assessing whether the reasoning is sound and the evidence is relevant and sufficient.”

- Repeated routine: Follow the same process as with previous lessons for students to read section 7 of ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma*** using the **Text** **Guide**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma*** (**for** **teacher** **reference**). Instruct students to read the sections independently, and support struggling students as needed. If students do not finish reading the sections within the allotted reading time, distribute **Synopsis**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma,*** **Section** **7** to each student to review the key details from the section. Instruct students to identify the author’s point of view in this section in their **Author’s** **Purpose** **and** **Point** **of** **View**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma*** **note** - **catcher**. As time permits, have students identify the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary, reflect on their reading as they choose, and record the gist on **sticky** **notes** using the following resources as appropriate: **vocabulary** **logs**, **academic** **word** **wall**, and **Work** **to** **Become** **Effective** **Learners** **anchor** **chart**.

- After reading, ask students to Think-Pair-Share about the gists they determined for each section of text:

“What is the gist of section 7?” (Higher-quality food costs more. Some people resist paying more for better food. Eating locally means eating seasonally. Local food consumers can “vote with your fork.”)

“What were some of your reactions to things the author talked about in section 7?” (Responses will vary, but may include surprise that many people will pay for high quality appliances and clothing but resist the higher prices of high-quality food, or informed because of new knowledge built about local foods, etc.)

“What questions did this section bring up for you?” (Responses will vary, but may include questions about the reality of eating local, or the availability of local foods in the area, etc.)

- Prompt students to Think-Pair-Share discussing the following questions:

“What is one pro related to local food/farming?” (Responses will vary, but may include: local food has a lighter impact on the environment because fossil fuels are not used to ship them across the country, people get to know their farmers and can trust them and the food they produce, and buying local food supports the local economy.)

“What is one con related to local food/farming?” (Responses will vary, but may include: local food is more expensive; it means eating seasonally, which people may not be used to; and it is not as easy to attain as going to the local supermarket.)

- Use **equity** **sticks** to collect answers from the group, and discuss responses.

- Display and distribute the **Delineate** **an** **Argument**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma***, **Section** **7** **graphic** **organizer**. For ELLs and students who require additional support, **Delineate** **an** **Argument**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma***, **Section** **7** **graphic** **organizer** ▲ can be used to help guide students’ thinking with prefilled information and selected response options.

- Tell students that they will continue the work they started in Lesson 4 around identifying argument and analyzing evidence using section 7 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*. In this lesson, they will complete this graphic organizer independently.

- Remind students that their task is to identify the author’s purpose and main claim from the text read, name supporting points that align to this claim, determine evidence that is relevant, identify any irrelevant evidence, and discuss the sufficiency of evidence and soundness of reasoning.

- Provide time for students to review the graphic organizer, and field any questions students have about the task. Prompt students to begin working individually.

- As students work, circulate and use the **Delineate** **an** **Argument**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma***, **Section** **7** **graphic** **organizer** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as needed. Ensure students have named the correct supporting points, are identifying relevant evidence accurately, and are analyzing the soundness of reasoning used by Pollan in this section of text. Pull small groups of students who may need more guidance selecting supporting evidence. As needed, work with students on the final section of the note-catcher on soundness of reasoning.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- After Work Time A, invite students to participate in a Mini Language Dive in small groups to explore a sentence from *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* to consider the author’s point of view. Students will also have the opportunity to explain the function of a gerund phrase. Further work with gerunds and infinitives and L.8.1a will take place in Module 3, but work with verbals is embedded into Language Dives and Mini Language Dives in advance of direct instruction and practice to help familiarize students with the concept.

- To extend work with gerund phrases after the optional Mini Language Dive, invite students to search for examples of gerund phrases in *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*. Students can share their examples in small groups and discuss the function of each one. This will help students to begin noticing patterns in usage.

For Heavier Support

- Invite students who need heavier support to use Delineate an Argument: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 7 graphic organizer▲. This resource has prefilled information, sentence starters, and selected response options to help guide students’ thinking.

Closing and Assessment

A. Delineate an Argument in a Video – SL.8.3 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can delineate a speaker’s argument and specific claims, evaluating the soundness of the reasoning and relevance and sufficiency of the evidence and identifying when irrelevant evidence is introduced.”

- Explain to students that they will now practice delineating arguments and identifying relevant evidence from a video. Remind students that they did similar work when they watched a video on farmers markets in a previous lesson.

- Distribute and display the **Delineate** **an** **Argument** **in** **a** **Video** **graphic** **organizer**. For ELLs and students who require additional support, **Delineate** **an** **Argument** **in** **a** **Video** **graphic** **organizer** ▲ can be used to help guide students’ thinking with prefilled information and selected response options. Explain that this graphic organizer has the same format as the one they used previously.

- Tell students that the video they will watch today is related to today’s excerpt from *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*. This video presents important arguments that they will analyze independently and then share with their partner.

- Prompt students to begin watching the video, directing students to play the video multiple times, pausing and capturing the main claim, supporting points, and relevant evidence on their graphic organizer.

- If students do not have access to individual devices, display the video **“Multiple Voices: In Season,”** playing it twice and pausing multiple times for students to capture information in their graphic organizers.

- As students work, circulate and use the **Delineate** **an** **Argument** **in** **a** **Video** **graphic** **organizer** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**). Ensure students have identified the correct main claim, supporting points, and related evidence and are identifying irrelevant evidence accurately and analyzing the sufficiency of evidence and explaining the soundness of the speaker’s reasoning.

- After students complete their graphic organizer, direct them to join with a partner, checking to see if their main claim, supporting points, and relevant evidence are in alignment.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.
