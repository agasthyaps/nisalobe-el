**Directions:** Answer the questions about irrelevant evidence and conflicting viewpoints in this section of text.

1.  Which of the following pieces of evidence is irrelevant to the author’s claim? (RI.8.8)

2.  People who eat healthier food have fewer health issues overall and live longer lives.

3.  Chickens grown on farms similar to Polyface Farm produce eggs with more omega-3s, beta-carotene, and vitamin E.

4.  Animals raised on grass provide meat, eggs, and milk that are healthier for consumers.

5.  Corn-fed cows don’t have a healthy balance of omegas.

6.  On page 216 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, it says: “Agribusiness has bombarded us with the message that all pork is pork, all chicken is chicken. They tell us one egg is exactly like any other, but that is just not the case. If that’s what you think, then you won’t pay a dollar extra for the same old carton of eggs. But when you know that some eggs are not only tastier, but also healthier to eat, then a dollar extra for a dozen seems like a bargain.”

How does Michael Pollan respond to this conflicting viewpoint that all food of one type tastes the same, regardless of how it is grown or raised, and therefore we shouldn’t pay extra for food raised locally? (RI.8.6)

7.  by referencing research findings about the variations in taste based on how an animal is raised

8.  by referencing the fact that some eggs do taste better and are healthier to eat

9.  by referencing an expert farmer’s confirmation that local eggs do not taste better, and therefore should not cost more

10. by referencing research findings about variations in taste that can be achieved through feeding chickens noncorn-based diets
