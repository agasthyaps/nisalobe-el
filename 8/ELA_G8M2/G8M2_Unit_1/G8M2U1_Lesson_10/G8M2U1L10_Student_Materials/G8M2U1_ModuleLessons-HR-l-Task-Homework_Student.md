1.  On page 323, Michael Pollan writes, “I suspect that reading this book will complicate your eating life.”

2.  What is the central claim of this section of text?

3.  Consumers can “vote with their fork” and help create a better world by making more sustainable food choices.

4.  Consumers should become vegetarians and stop eating meat in order to solve the “omnivore’s dilemma.”

5.  Students should tell their schools to make better food choices in cafeterias.

6.  All families should become informed consumers and change the way they are eating to veganism.

7.  What is one supporting point for this claim?

8.  Fast food is a terrible choice for consumers to make. It harms the environment, animals, and human health.

9.  Making small choices, like eating meat from CSAs or drinking less soda, will have a positive impact on the environment, your health, and local farmers.

10. Eating local foods and eating seasonally are the only ways to have a positive impact on farmers, your health, and the environment.

11. All people should make responsible food choices and eat a vegetarian diet consisting of food derived only from plants.

12. On page 324, Michael Pollan writes, “But whatever conclusion readers come to, they are more thoughtful about their choices—they act now out of knowledge rather than ignorance, and that’s the most important thing.”

What does this statement mean to you? What conclusions about the “omnivore’s dilemma” are you making in your own life and in your own food choices?
