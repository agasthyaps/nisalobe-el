Independent Research:  
Local Food Note-Catcher

RI.8.7, RI.8.9, SL.8.2

(Example for Teacher Reference)

As discussed in Work Time A, both Michael Pollan and Bryant Terry mention the importance of buying local food as a way to make more sustainable food choices. Doing this cuts down on food miles, ensures the food tastes great, supports the local economy, and helps consumers build trust and relationships with their farmers.

**Directions:** Conduct a research search, looking for information that contradicts the importance of local food. Pick one of the rows below, and find an additional source with related evidence that contradicts the information discussed in Work Time A.

Use pages 211–214 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* and the NourishLife video “What You Can Do” as background information on local food as needed.

<p><u>Evidence</u>:</p>
<p>“What this means is that if you want to reduce the carbon footprint of your diet, you should focus on buying foods with lower overall carbon footprints rather than those that don’t have to travel far. This basically means eating less meat and dairy.”</p>

<p><strong>“The point is food miles are only a small part of a very large food emissions story, so focusing on them in isolation isn’t necessarily helpful if your goal is to cut your foodprint.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In fact what you eat is generally more important than where it comes from, as is how much you waste.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>“While it’s certainly true that transportation pollution is dramatically lower when buying locally sourced goods, overall per-unit environmental costs are much higher.

<p><strong>The trust and relationship could be built of false perceptions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“The tie between social responsibility and local buying is one that needs to be examined closely, Norwood said. ‘Is it more ethical because it’s local? Maybe, maybe not,’ Norwood said. ‘It’s so hard to figure out what components are ethical or not ethical.’ This could include farming practices, how a product is created or how the business treats its workers.”</strong></p>
