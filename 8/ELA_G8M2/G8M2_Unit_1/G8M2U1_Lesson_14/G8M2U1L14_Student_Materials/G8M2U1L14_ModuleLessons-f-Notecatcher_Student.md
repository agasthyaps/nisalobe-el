Independent Research:  
Local Food Note-Catcher

RI.8.7, RI.8.9, SL.8.2

**Name:** **Date:**

As discussed in Work Time A, both Michael Pollan and Bryant Terry mention the importance of buying local food as a way to make more sustainable food choices. Doing this cuts down on food miles, ensures the food tastes great, supports the local economy, and helps consumers build trust and relationships with their farmers.

**Directions:** Conduct a research search, looking for information that contradicts the importance of local food. Pick one of the rows below, and find an additional source with related evidence that contradicts the information discussed in Work Time A.

Use pages 211–214 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* and the NourishLife video “What You Can Do” as background information on local food as needed.
