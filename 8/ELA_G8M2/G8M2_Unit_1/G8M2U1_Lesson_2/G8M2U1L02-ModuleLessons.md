Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.8.6 – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they determine what an author’s point of view is in a nonfiction text.

- RI.8.6 – Work Time A: Students read section 1 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* and analyze the author’s purpose and point of view.

- RI.8.1 – Work Time A: Students cite evidence from the text to support their analysis of the author’s purpose and point of view.

- L.8.4 – Work Time A: Students determine or clarify the meanings of unfamiliar words in the text.

- RI.8.4 – Work Time A: Students determine the meanings of words or phrases as they are used in the text.

- RI.8.6 – Work Time B: Students analyze a sentence in a Language Dive to help them better understand the author’s purpose in *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*.

- L.8.1a – Work Time B: Students analyze a sentence in a Language Dive to help them better understand the function of infinitive phrases in sentences.

- RI.8.6 – Closing and Assessment A: Students answer selected and constructed response questions focused on the author’s purpose and point of view.

- In this lesson, students engage in the following new protocol (instructions for which appear at the first point of use in the lesson):

- Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face: This protocol provides a method for sharing information and gaining multiple perspectives on a topic through partner interaction. It can be used for reviewing and sharing academic material, as a personal “ice breaker,” or as a means of engaging in critical thinking about a topic of debate.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Students could read the entire introduction of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* and further analyze the author’s point of view on other topics in this section of the text.

- To extend work with infinitive phrases and L.8.1a, after the Language Dive, invite students to look for other examples of infinitive phrases within the Introduction of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*. Students can share the examples they find in small groups or with the class and discuss the function (noun, adjective, adverb) of each.

- Review the questions on Author’s Purpose and Point of View, *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 1, with the selected response options covered, and give students the opportunity to generate the answers themselves. Students can then compare their responses with the selected response options to verify their interpretations.

- Students can conduct an internet search to find more information about Michael Pollan and his work. They can locate short videos, interviews, and biographical information as well as other texts written by Pollan and share these in small groups or with the whole class.

- Students can research the food traditions of different national and cultural groups abroad and use this information as a point of comparison as they consider food consumption in the United States as they read *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*.

- In high school, students will analyze how an author or speaker uses rhetoric to advance his or her point of view or purpose. Students might analyze the use of rhetoric (the art of effective or persuasive speaking or writing, especially the use of figures of speech and other compositional techniques) within *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous module, students read the anchor text and analyzed the point of view of characters in the novel. In this lesson, students evaluate the point of view of the author in this informational text and determine the author’s purpose.

Support All Students

- Note that section 1 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* brings up the complex idea of the omnivore’s dilemma itself—the concept that Americans often do not know where our food comes from and/or what is healthy to eat. Humans can eat plants and animals but do not necessarily know what is good or bad for our health and can have some difficult choices to make. Some students or their families may find these topics to be new, challenging, or even frustrating depending on their own eating habits, knowledge, access, or other factors. Allow for time to process and respond to these topics during individual, small group, or full class discussion, and reach out to families as needed. Use thoughtful strategic pairing for discussions around these topics to ensure that all students feel comfortable.

- In Work Time A, provide choice in how students read the excerpt: some students may prefer to read independently and silently, while others (especially ELLs) may wish to read aloud in groups with peers and/or with support. Still others may wish to read silently for a few pages and then process with a group. This format of choice could potentially be built into the reading time within each lesson. ▲

- As in previous lessons, in Work Time A, present additional options for recording gist rather than just the sticky notes, such as using a separate notebook, using a graphic organizer, using highlighters and annotating, or using a voice recorder. Give students options for expressing their understanding of gist (oral, written, drawing). Also, build in different options for expressing comprehension of the text (written reflection, voice recording, discussion with partners/groups). ▲

- Students may need support in understanding the concept of organic and processed foods. Show images or videos to provide visual examples of these foods that students encounter in the supermarket. Students may also benefit from an infographic of a food chain. Provide an infographic, or have the class create one together.

- Note there is a differentiated version of Author’s Purpose and Point of View: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* note-catcher used in Work Time B in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- When pairing students to answer selected and constructed response questions in Closing and Assessment A, group ELLs with partners who have more advanced or native language proficiency. The partners with greater language proficiency can serve as a model, initiating discussions and providing implicit sentence frames, for example. Use the same pairing in future lessons if this pairing is successful. This will support students in building trust and becoming more comfortable and confident with their peers. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson includes supported in-class reading of the module anchor text, *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*; a Language Dive to explore the author’s purpose; and practice with answering selected and constructed response questions about point of view and purpose in the text that closely mirror questions on the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment. The lesson also includes opportunities for collaborative discussion and work with academic and domain-specific vocabulary, both of which support ELLs in their linguistic development.

- ELLs may find it challenging to determine the author’s point of view and purpose in a nonfiction text. The entrance ticket in this lesson invites students to consider how point of view in a nonfiction text differs from a fiction text. Encourage students to consider what they already know about point of view from Module 1 and their work with *The Summer of the Mariposas*, but help them to anticipate that this concept will look different as they read nonfiction material in this unit.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6, 8.I.B.7, 8.I.B.8, and 8.II.B.4.

Assessment Guidance

- Check student vocabulary logs for accountability in recording vocabulary.

- Check gist statements to ensure students are recording quick notes about what the text is mostly about.

- As students work in pairs to answer selected and constructed response questions in Closing and Assessment A, listen to discussions to determine how close students are to understanding how to answer questions related to RI.8.6 to determine any common issues that could be used as teaching points for the whole group.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue to read *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* and analyze the author’s purpose and point of view. Students will also begin to analyze paragraph structure in the text.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.8.6 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **1**, **Lesson** **2**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 1, and Analyze Purpose and Point of View – RI.8.6 (20 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze the author’s point of view and purpose in an excerpt from *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*.”

- Instruct students to retrieve their copies of ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma*** and turn to page 10.

- Read aloud section 1 as students read along silently. Refer to the **Text** **Guide**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma*** (**for** **teacher** **reference**) for excerpt, questions, and vocabulary. If students are able to read independently or in small groups, group students accordingly, and set the time for them to read the excerpt. If students do not finish reading the section within the allotted reading time, distribute **Synopsis**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma***, **Section** **1** to each student to review the key details from the section.

- After reading the section, ask students to Think-Pair-Share about the gist they determined for the section of text:

“What is the gist of this section?” (The author is investigating food sources.)

- Invite students to record the gist onto a **sticky** **note**, sticking it at the front of the chapter for quick reference. Alternatively, give students a different option for recording gist, such as writing a margin note or using a graphic organizer that they will return to in the future.

- With students’ support, record the meanings of *food* *chain* (the series of processes by which food is grown or produced, sold, and eventually consumed), *organic* (produced or involving production without the use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, or other artificial agents), and *processed* *food* (a series of mechanical or chemical operations performed to change or preserve food) on the **domain** - **specific word wall** with translations in students’ home languages. Write synonyms or sketch a visual above each key term to scaffold students’ understanding. Invite students to record these words in their **vocabulary** **logs**.

- Lead students through the following steps of the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol for the questions below:

- Partners stand back-to-back to each other, being respectful of space, listening as each question is posed.

- Prompt students to turn and stand face-to-face with each other.

- Direct partner A to share his or her answer to the question posed.

- Direct partner B to share his or her answer to the question posed.

- Tell students to find a different partner, and proceed through steps 1–4 again.

- Repeat for each question.

- Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face:

“What food traditions does your family or culture have? What food(s) do you eat often?” (Responses will vary, but may include: arroz con pollo, roti, fish and chips, Black Forest ham, assam, ravioli, chorizo, spring pancake, cornbread, barbecue)

“What are you interested to learn more about now?” (Responses will vary, but may include: where food comes from, or specific food chains that the author has called out.)

“What did the author say about the point of this book?” (Responses will vary, but may include that the point isn’t to scare the reader. It’s to help us rediscover the pleasures of food.)

- Emphasize the point of the text by rereading aloud the final paragraph of the introduction, beginning at, “There were parts of this book that were difficult to write . . . .”

- Remind students that they analyzed the point of view of characters in the previous module. Explain to students that “point of view” is a bit different in a nonfiction text. Students will analyze the point of view of the author of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* because the book is a nonfiction text and is written from Michael Pollan’s perspective. Explain to students that some nonfiction texts are purely information, like an encyclopedia, and are not written from a particular point of view, but other texts, like this one, present particular points of view and perspectives. Tell students that they will analyze the author’s attitude toward certain topics and begin to describe and evaluate the author’s thinking in detail in the upcoming lessons.

- Display and distribute **Author’s** **Purpose** **and** **Point** **of** **View**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma* note** - **catcher**. For ELLs and students who require additional support, the **Author’s** **Purpose** **and** **Point** **of** **View**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma* note** - **catcher** ▲ can be used to help guide students’ thinking with pre-filled information and sentence starters to help students complete the first entry.

- Orient students to the note-catcher. Read aloud the headings on the note-catcher and the supporting prompt questions in each section. Tell students that this note-catcher will help them track the author’s purpose and point of view on different topics throughout the book. Remind students that the author’s purpose is the reason the author writes something.

- Have students turn to page 11. Draw students’ attention to the following sentence:

“But I found I was going crazy from worrying about food.”

- Ask students the following questions from the note-catcher:

“What topic is the author addressing?” (where our food comes from)

“What is the author’s attitude toward this topic?” (Where our food comes from is important and something we should really think about.)

“What is the author’s reason for writing this?” (to educate readers about where our food comes from and what is in it)

“What words or ideas from the excerpt helped you determine that point of view?” (*going crazy, worrying*)

“How does the author’s point of view add to our understanding of this topic?” (helps us understand how complicated the omnivore’s dilemma is)

- Have students agree on responses as a class. Record these responses on the displayed note-catcher, and instruct students to follow along and record the responses on their own note-catchers. Refer to **Author’s** **Purpose** **and** **Point** **of** **View**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma* note** - **catcher** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as needed.

- Draw students’ attention to the following sentence on page 11:

<!-- -->

- “Instead we have dozens of different ‘experts’ who give us lots of different advice about what to eat and what not to eat.”

<!-- -->

- Ask students the following questions from the note-catcher:

“What topic is the author addressing?” (the way we get information about our food today)

“What is the author’s attitude toward this topic?” (Our food choices are more confusing now, and we don’t know whom to listen to.)

“What is the author’s reason for writing this?” (to prove to the reader that we have an “omnivore’s dilemma” in how to make good food choices)

“What words or ideas from the excerpt helped you determine that point of view?” (*experts,* people knew about food because they grew it or hunted it themselves)

“How does the author’s point of view add to our understanding of this topic?” (helps us understand that we do not have firsthand knowledge of where our food comes from)

- Have students agree on responses as a class. Record the class responses on the displayed note-catcher, and instruct students to follow along and record the responses on their own note-catchers. Refer to Author’s Purpose and Point of View: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* note-catcher (example for teacher reference) as needed.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- Review the questions on Author’s Purpose and Point of View, *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 1 Questions with the selected response options covered prior to the in-class reading in Work Time A. This will guide students’ reading of the text, helping them to identify key information.

For Heavier Support

- Provide students with Synopsis: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 1 in advance of the in-class reading in Work Time A. For students who require heavier support, the synopsis can provide students with a “map” of what they will read and help them to follow key information presented in this section.

- Review the questions and selected response options on Author’s Purpose and Point of View, *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 1 Questions prior to the in-class reading in Work Time A. This will guide students’ reading of the text, helping them to identify key information.

- Invite students who need heavier support to use the Author’s Purpose and Point of View: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* note-catcher ▲. This resource has prefilled information and sentence starters to help guide students’ thinking when filling in the first entry.

Work Time

B. Language Dive: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Page 11 – RI.8.6 (10 minutes)

- Tell students they will now participate in a Language Dive to explore the author’s purpose in *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* and how infinitive phrases function in sentences.

- Reread aloud page 11 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*.

- Focus students on the sentence:

- “I decided to become a food detective, to find out where our food comes from and exactly what it is we are eating.”

- Use the **Language** **Dive** **Guide**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma***, **Page** **11** (**for** **teacher** **reference**) to guide students through a Language Dive conversation about the sentence. Distribute and display the **Language** **Dive**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma***, **Page** **11** **note** - **catcher**, and the **Language** **Dive**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma***, **Page** **11** **sentence** **chunk** **strips**. Refer to the **Language** **Dive**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma***, **Page** **11** **note** - **catcher** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as needed.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- To extend work with infinitives after the Language Dive in Work Time B, invite students to look for examples of infinitives in the Introduction of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*. Display examples, and have students work together to analyze the function of each infinitive and discuss any patterns they notice.

Closing and Assessment

A. Selected and Constructed Response Questions: Purpose and Point of View – RI.8.6 (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze the author’s point of view and purpose in an excerpt from *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*.”

- Display the **Strategies** **to** **Answer** **Selected** **Response** **Questions** **anchor** **chart**. Read each strategy for students to review how to answer selected response questions. Answer any clarifying questions.

- Group students strategically into pairs, and display and distribute **Author’s** **Purpose** **and** **Point** **of** **View**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma***, **Section** **1** **questions**. Read each of the questions aloud as students read along silently, and explain that students will work together to answer the questions focused on the author’s purpose and point of view in this excerpt from *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*. Tell students that they will answer similar questions on the mid-unit assessment that will measure their development of these skills.

- Direct students’ attention to the **Work** **to** **Become** **Effective** **Learners** **anchor** **chart**, and review what collaboration looks and sounds like.

- Instruct students to answer the selected and constructed response questions with a partner.

- Circulate as students work to ensure they are on track and answer any clarifying questions. Refer to **Author’s** **Purpose** **and** **Point** **of** **View**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma***, **Section** **1** **questions** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) for the answer key.

- Refocus the class. Read aloud the first question, and ask volunteers to share their answers with the class. Repeat with questions 2 and 3.

- Explain to students that they will continue to analyze the author’s purpose and point of view as they read the anchor text and that in future lessons, they will analyze the author’s arguments about food choices.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.
