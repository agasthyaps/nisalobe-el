*The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Page 11

RI.8.6, L.8.1a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

I decided **to become a food detective**, to find out where our food comes from and exactly what it is we are eating. (from page 11 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* by Michael Pollan)

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: To help students address the daily learning target (**I can determine the author’s point of view and purpose in the Introduction of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*.**) and RI.8.6, this sentence provides information about the author’s purpose in writing the text. The sentence also helps students to address L.8.1a by providing an opportunity for students to explain the function of infinitive phrases within the sentence. Supporting Standards: SL.8.1

- Guiding Question: To help students respond to two guiding questions (**Where does our food come from? How do we analyze arguments about how food should be grown and processed?**), this sentence aligns the anchor text’s purpose with the purpose of the unit.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses infinitive phrases with the purpose of explaining intended actions and purpose. Invite students to discuss each chunk briefly, but encourage extended conversation and practice with the focus structure: **I decided to become**. Based on student need and time, consider adding days for extended conversation, and practice with a new focus structure: **to find out where our food comes from and exactly what it is we are eating.**

- Practice and Transfer: After discussing the focus structure, students practice using it to discuss something in their lives. Students transfer their understanding of the meaning and structure of this sentence when writing short constructed responses about the purpose of texts and videos on the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment.

- Note that the chunk **food detective** is presented out of order to help students understand the structure and meaning of the verb and infinitive in the chunk **I decided to become**.

Throughout the Language Dive

Refer to the instructions provided in the first three Language Dives of Module 1.

To focus students’ attention on infinitive phrases in this sentence, use red, blue, and green markers to code the sentence (red: verb, noun: blue, adverb: green). One purpose of this Language Dive is to give students the opportunity to explain the function of infinitive phrases in a particular sentence. Students will explore the function of verbals (**gerunds**, **infinitives**, **participles**) in greater depth in Module 3.

Launch

- Remind students of the daily learning target **(I can determine the author’s point of view and purpose in the Introduction of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*)**.

- Ask:

“In today’s lesson, we are determining Michael Pollan’s purpose in writing The Omnivore’s Dilemma. What is another way to say purpose? (a reason for doing something, or a goal or objective)

- Invite students to keep the meaning of **purpose** in mind as they analyze the Language Dive sentence.

Deconstruct

- Invite students to put their finger by this sentence from *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* on their note-catchers: **<u>I decided to become</u> a food detective, to find out where our food comes from and exactly what it is we are eating.**

- Read aloud the sentence twice, and then ask students to take turns reading the sentence aloud with their partners.

- Ask:

“What does this sentence mean to you?” (Answers will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“How does this sentence add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Answers will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

a food detective,

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **a food detective,**

- Ask:

“Can you figure out what a detective is?” (someone who investigates things to find out new, previously unknown information)

- Note: As time allows, help students to deepen their understanding of what a detective is by inviting them to consider and discuss the work that they do as language detectives during Language Dives.

“Can you figure out what a food detective is?” (someone who learns as much as possible about food)

- Say:

“I’ll give you time to sketch a food detective on your note-catcher.”

- After inviting responses, display students’ ideas.

I decided to become

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **I decided to become**

- Ask:

“What did Michael Pollan decide to become?” (a food detective)

“What does it mean to decide something?” (to make a choice)

“How do you think making a decision connects to having a purpose?” (When we make a decision, we commit to doing something to achieve a goal or objective.)

“What part of speech is decided? How do you know? (Decided is a verb. We know this because it comes after a subject, I, and because it ends in -ed to indicate past tense.)

- Underline decided in red, and invite students to do the same on their note-catchers. 

- Ask:

“What kinds of words and phrases usually follow verbs?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to identify that many verbs are followed by direct or indirect objects, which are nouns and noun phrases.)

“What do you notice about the direct object that follows the verb decided?” (Responses will vary, but help students to notice that decided is followed by the word to and the base form of the verb become.)

- Tell students that **to** + base form of verb is called an **infinitive**. Infinitives look like verbs, but they function as nouns, adjectives, or adverbs.

- Ask:

“In this sentence, is this infinitive functioning as a noun, adjective, or adverb? How do you know?” (We know it is a noun because it is the direct object of the verb decided).

- Underline to become in blue, and invite students to do the same on their note-catchers. 

“What other verbs can you think of that can be followed by an infinitive phrase as a direct object functioning as a noun?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses. As needed, offer examples like want, try, attempt, intend, work, hope.)

“What do you notice these verbs have in common?” (They all refer to the future and tell us about intention and purpose.)

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Display the sentence frame:

> **I decided \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**
>
> (subject + verb + infinitive)
>
> (**to** + base form of verb = infinitive)

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use this frame to talk about something you decided to do yesterday in your own words with your partners.”

to find out where our food comes from and exactly what it is we are eating.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **to find out where our food comes from and exactly what it is we are eating.**

- Ask:

“What does this chunk tell us about Michael Pollan’s decision to become a food detective?” (that he became a food detective to learn more about the source of our food and what is in it)

“Can you find an infinitive in this chunk?” (Look for students to point to or say to find out.)

“What’s another way to say to find out?” (to learn, to discover, to understand)

“Can you figure out the function of this infinitive? Is it functioning as a noun, an adjective, or an adverb? How do you know?” (This phrase gives us more information about what a food detective does. It describes the <u>action</u> of deciding to become a food detective, which means that it is an adverb.)

- Underline to find out in green, and invite students to do the same on their note-catchers.

I decided to become a food detective, to find out where our food comes from and exactly what it is we are eating.

Reconstruct

- Point to and read aloud the entire sentence on display: **I decided <u>to become a food detective,</u> to find out where our food comes from and exactly what it is we are eating.**

- Ask:

“What if we move the infinitive phrase to find out where our food comes from and exactly what it is we are eating to the front of the sentence?” (The sentence still makes sense. Adverb phrases can appear at the front or the end of a clause. Fronting an adverb may emphasize the information within it. In this sentence, since the adverb phrase tells us <u>why</u> Michael decided to become a food detective, moving it to the front emphasizes his purpose.)

“How does this sentence help us to understand Michael Pollan’s purpose in writing The Omnivore’s Dilemma?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all replies.)

- If productive, give an example to cue students to expand the conversation:

“What, in the sentence, makes you think so?” (Answers will vary.)

- Ask:

“How can we use infinitives in our own speaking and writing?” (Answers will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all replies.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- Ask:

“What other questions can we ask that will help us understand this sentence?” (Answers will vary.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Answers will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding questions: Where does our food come from? How do we analyze arguments about how food should be grown and processed?” (Answers will vary.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

> **I attempted \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ a summary of my independent reading research**
>
> infinitive
>
> **text, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ the key ideas in the book.**
>
> infinitive

(**to** + base form of verb = infinitive)

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use this frame to talk about the purpose of writing a summary of an independent research reading text in your own words with your partners.”

- Tell or remind students that posting the chunks in language categories will help them use the language again for future speaking and writing tasks.

- Call on volunteers, and say:

“Now take each chunk and post it to the appropriate column of the Language Chunk Wall. You can refer to these chunks again as you speak and write.”
