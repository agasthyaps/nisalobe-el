5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

RI.8.6, L.8.2a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

All these explanations are true**, but they don’t tell the whole story.** (from page 92 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* by Michael Pollan)

**Lesson 6 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after students read the text in Work Time A.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target (**I can determine an author’s point of view and analyze how the author addresses conflicting evidence or viewpoints**) and RI.8.6 by presenting students with an opportunity to analyze how the author acknowledges and responds to a conflicting viewpoint. This sentence also helps students to address L.8.2a by demonstrating how a comma can be used to indicate a pause before a coordinating conjunction to connect two independent clauses.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses a coordinating conjunction (**but**) with the purpose of introducing a response to a conflicting viewpoint.

- Transfer: independent clause + **but** + independent clause when introducing a response to a conflicting viewpoint in an argument essay in Unit 3 of this module. Students will also transfer their knowledge of this structure when delineating arguments on the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **All these explanations are true<u>, but they don’t tell the whole story.</u>**

- Ask:

“What is the gist of this sentence?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **, but they don’t tell the whole story.**

- Ask:

“What does this chunk tell us about the explanations that people give for the increase in obesity?” (The explanations are incomplete and formed without consideration of some key information.)

“Why does the writer use a comma to indicate a pause before the word but? (because but is a coordinating conjunction that is connecting two independent clauses, each of which contains its own idea)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **All these explanations are true<u>, but they don’t tell the whole story.</u>**

- Ask:

“What if we replace but with and to connect these two independent clauses?” (When we use and, the meaning is unclear because the second idea contrasts with the first. But clarifies the relationship between the two clauses.)

“Can you figure out why Michael Pollan includes two contrasting ideas in this sentence?” (ln the first clause, he is acknowledging that some of the explanations given for rising obesity are true. In the second clause, he is introducing a response to this viewpoint.)

“What other words or phrases do you know that indicate contrast?” (however, on the other hand)

“How can we use but in our speaking or writing?” (We use it to connect two independent clauses that contain contrasting information. Specifically, to introduce a response to a conflicting viewpoint.)

- Ask:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does this Mini Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target: I can determine an author’s point of view and analyze how the author addresses conflicting evidence or viewpoints?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

> **Some people say students today \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, but \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**
>
> predicate independent clause
>
> (verb + \[object\] = predicate)
>
> (subject + verb + \[object\] = independent clause)

- Say:

“In your own words and with your partners, use this frame to introduce a response to a viewpoint about students that conflicts with your own.”

- Sample response:

> **Some people say students today <u>shouldn’t have cell phones</u>**, but
>
> predicate
>
> **<u>technology actually helps with homework</u>.**
>
> independent clause
>
> (verb + \[object\] = predicate)
>
> (subject + verb + \[object\] = independent clause)
