![](media/image1.png) Guiding Questions and Big Ideas

The following guiding questions frame the work of this module.

Where does our food come from?

- *Consumers have many choices when it comes to eating healthy food. These choices relate to how the food is grown and raised, processed, or transported. The choices are complicated and varied—from processed or industrially produced food, to industrial organic food, to local, sustainable food.*

- *Deepening understanding about the variety of processes and practices can help consumers both better understand where their food comes from and make more informed choices about the food they eat.*

- *The choices consumers make around food impact their own health and the sustainability of the environment.*

- *Choices about eating healthy food, and conflicting information about the impact of processes and practices, can present a dilemma to consumers.*

- *It’s important to consider diverse perspectives and points of view to fully understand the factors that influence access to healthy food.*

How do we analyze arguments about how food should be grown and processed?

- *Delineating an author’s arguments helps readers more deeply understand the purpose, point of view, evidence, and reasoning presented on a topic.*

- *When evaluating arguments, considering an author’s point of view and purpose helps readers understand the motive behind the information presented.*

- *Understanding motive can help consumers to interpret information to make informed decisions about healthy food.*

- *Analyzing sufficiency and relevancy of evidence helps readers determine if the reasoning presented on an argument is sound.*

- *Authors may acknowledge and respond to conflicting viewpoints. They may include conflicting viewpoints in order to show readers that there are different views or understandings of a topic, or in order to argue against them.*

What will your student be doing at school?

Throughout this unit, your student will develop their reading and writing skills by engaging in a variety of experiences that grow their understanding of the choices people make regarding food. As readers, students must build a robust toolbox to help them analyze, understand, and enjoy texts as well as respond to them in writing. Students in Grade 8 pay attention to various literary devices and components in the texts they read, and classroom instruction is aligned to support their fluency with these components. Some of these experiences and literacy components are outlined below:

- **Read an Anchor Text: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* (Young Readers Edition).** Each module is grounded in an anchor text. For this module, students read the text *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*. *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* profiles four food choices that consumers can make—industrial food; industrial organic food; local, sustainable food; and do-it-yourself food (hunted, gathered, and gardened). While examining the reality of each food choice, Michael Pollan presents detailed information on the ingredients, practices, and impact of each food choice. While reading, students explore the array of options, access, and information that Americans have when deciding what to eat.

- **Analyze Author’s Point of View:** As students read *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, they analyze the author’s point of view on different topics on food choices and locate evidence that supports that point of view.

- **Point of View:** Students learn to examine the author’s attitude toward a topic. An example of a point of view from the beginning of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* is: our food choices are more confusing now, and we don’t know to whom to listen.

- **Analyze Purpose and Motive:** Authors have various purposes and motives when presenting information. As students deepen their understanding on the topic of food choices, they explore an author’s purpose and motive and discuss the varied motives and purposes that are implied in texts. Students practice identifying purpose and motive as they answer selected and constructed response questions from each section of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*.

- **Purpose:** A purpose for writing is the reason an author decides to write about a topic. Examples of purposes are to: inform, describe, convey, persuade, or convince.

- **Motive:** A motive inspires action or is the reason for doing something. Examples of the motives students discuss are: political, environmental, social, and commercial.

- **Analyze Advantages and Disadvantages of Mediums:** Authors choose specific mediums to convey information depending on the ways the particular medium will help them share their message. Students explore the advantages and disadvantages of the following mediums while discussing the topic of food choices:

- photo (visual), video (multimedia: visual and audio), text (printed written work), text (digital written work), infographic (multimedia: visual and written), and speech (audio).

- **Delineate and Evaluate Arguments:** As students read, they begin to delineate and evaluate the arguments Michael Pollan presents in the anchor text, as well as argument presented in video format, considering whether the evidence is relevant and sufficient and whether the reasoning is sound.

- **Delineating an Argument Graphic Organizer:** Students practice these skills while reading each section of text by answering questions such as:

<!-- -->

- What is the author’s purpose for writing this text?

- What is the main claim of this section of text?

- What are the supporting points and relevant evidence for the main claim?

- Is the evidence presented in this text section sufficient? Is the reasoning shared in this text section sound?

<!-- -->

- **Relevant and Irrelevant Evidence:** When analyzing arguments, students determine if evidence presented on a topic is relevant, or related to, the topic. In addition, students recognize unrelated, or irrelevant, evidence.

- **Sufficient Evidence:** When analyzing arguments, students look for sufficient, or enough, evidence on a topic. Without sufficient evidence, authors will have trouble convincing readers of their claims.

- **Sound Reasoning:** Students practice determining if the reasoning used to describe an argument is sound. Sound reasoning refers to the explanation of evidence used in an argument. This explanation needs to be relevant, sufficient, and clear. Ultimately, sound reasoning helps the reader connect the evidence presented to the main claim of the argument in a clear way.

The reading and writing skills students develop in the fifteen lessons in Unit 1 prepare them for both major assessments in the unit. In the mid-unit assessment, students independently analyze a claim, points, and evidence presented by a speaker and answer questions about the author’s purpose, claim, points, and evidence. They then analyze how the structure of particular paragraphs develops and refines key ideas about where our food comes from. For their end of unit assessment, students answer questions about the advantages and disadvantages of using different mediums and analyze how two resources provide conflicting information.

Central to the EL Education curriculum is a focus on “habits of character” and social-emotional learning. With this in mind, students work on various habits of character throughout the curriculum:

- Work to Become Effective Learners – developing mindsets and skills for success in college, career, and life (e.g., initiative, responsibility, perseverance, collaboration)

- Work to Become Ethical People – treating others well and standing up for what is right (e.g., empathy, integrity, respect, compassion)

- Work to Contribute to a Better World – putting their learning to use to improve communities (e.g., citizenship, service)

In this unit, students focus on working to become effective learners as they show perseverance to learn and practice new reading and listening skills that allow them to evaluate an author’s or speaker’s point of view, motives, purpose, structure, and argument. Students persevere as they practice many new skills related to delineating argument and determining an author’s purpose, motive, and point of view. Students show responsibility as they complete complicated tasks related to delineating arguments and determining an author’s purpose and motive.

How can you support your student at home?

Talk to your student about the guiding questions, particularly if any of the topics raised might be sensitive for your student or family.

Talk to your student about the texts he or she is reading in the classroom, particularly if any of the topics raised might be sensitive for your student.

Reach out to teachers if you have any questions or concerns about the text.

Talk to your student about the food choices presented in *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*. Discuss priorities or traditions your family may have around food.

Read informational books and articles with your student relevant to food choices, and discuss issues related to food production, distribution, packaging, etc.

Explore issues related to food in your own community. Discuss any challenges people have accessing healthy food in your area, or any ways your community supports access to healthy food.

Unit 1: Homework

Students engage in two kinds of reading for homework, with choice reading as an additional option.

**Anchor text reading:** Students preread chapters of the anchor text, *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, to prepare for the next lesson. They also reread the chapters of the text read in class and answer questions about it.

**Independent research reading:** When not reading his or her anchor text, your student is expected to independently research the topic. In the first lesson, students complete both types of reading as both independent research reading and the anchor text are introduced. When not assigned readings in the anchor text, students read topic-related books of his or her choice for approximately 20 minutes <u>each day</u> and respond to a prompt of choice in the <u>front</u> of the independent reading journal. These are usually books your student will bring home from school; however, they may be topic-related books chosen by your student at the public or your home library. Prompts for independent reading can be found in the homework materials provided.

**Choice reading:** If your student would also like to independently read and respond to a book of free choice, he or she may use the <u>back</u> of the independent reading journal. Prompts for independent reading can be found in the homework materials provided.

Independent Research Reading

**Directions:** Remember to record responses to research reading in the front of your independent reading journal and responses to choice reading in the back. Try to choose a different prompt each time.

Record any new vocabulary in your vocabulary log. Underline vocabulary found during independent reading.

**Record:**

- Date

- Title and author of your reading book

- Pages you have read

- Prompt

- Response

**Example:**

<u>Date:</u> 10/13/2020

<u>Book Title and Author:</u> *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* (Young Readers Edition) by Michael Pollan

<u>Pages Read:</u> 17–29

<u>Prompt:</u> What major ideas are present in the text you read? Give text details that convey those ideas.

<u>Response:</u> In this section, the author, Michael Pollan, talks about the prevalence of corn in the American diet. He shares examples of corn consumers knowingly ingest and highlights food products containing corn that are surprising to most Americans (e.g., wax on the vegetables we eat!). Details that he mentions on pages 18–19 are about how many items we eat that contain corn. In the example, he informs the reader that although we think of supermarkets as housing a large variety of items, most of those items contain corn. He goes on to say that corn is fed to the cattle, pigs, chicken, and fish we eat; to the chickens whose eggs we eat; and to the cows that produce the dairy products we consume. This is just the beginning of the long list of items containing corn that Pollan shares with the reader. These details highlight how frequently Americans ingest corn—sometimes intentionally, and many times unknowingly. Pollan’s knowledge of these details and how he lays them out to the reader early in the book demonstrate his interest and purpose in writing the book: to inform consumers about the food they eat so they can make healthy food choices.

**Consider using the following independent reading prompts.**[^1]

- How does this text add to your understanding of one of the guiding questions of the module?

- Which habits of character are demonstrated in the text? Explain.

- What is the central idea or theme of the text? How was this idea developed?

- Record two or three facts in your own words that you learned from the text.

- Summarize your research reading today in no more than five sentences.

- What major ideas are present in the text you read? Give text details that convey those details.

- What questions do you have about the topic after reading?

- Choose one new word from your reading today, and analyze it on a vocabulary square:

|                                                   |                                            |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Definition in your own words**                  | **Synonyms** (words with the same meaning) |
| **Words with the same affix or root**             | **Sketch**                                 |
| **Translation in home language** (if appropriate) |                                            |

Vocabulary

**Directions:** In the classroom, you have been recording words from your texts in your vocabulary log. Throughout this unit, you have been research reading topic-related books at home to build your knowledge of where food comes from and recording words in your independent reading journal.

Choose a word from your research reading or from a text you’ve read in class and add the word to your vocabulary log. Try to choose a different word to add and to practice a different vocabulary strategy each time. For each word, be sure to add the following:

1.  The definition, or meaning, of the word

<!-- -->

3.  The vocabulary strategy you used to figure out the meaning of the word

4.  A sketch or diagram that helps you to better understand the meaning of the word

Record new vocabulary in vocabulary logs and mark academic vocabulary with a symbol (for example a star):

- Academic vocabulary: words you might find in informational texts on many different topics. For example, the words *evidence* and *rationale* are words that could be found in books on any topic.

- Domain-specific vocabulary: words about a particular topic. For example, the words *tadpoles*, *frogspawn*, and *amphibian* are some that would be found in a text on the topic of frogs.

**Vocabulary Strategies**

As a reminder, the vocabulary strategies we’ve been working on in class are:

- Context: read the sentence around the word.

- Look at the affixes for clues.

- Look at the root of the word for clues.

- Use a dictionary.

- Discuss the word with another person (after attempting some of the above strategies).

[^1]: Some of the prompts will not be appropriate for the text students are reading. Invite students to choose a prompt that works for the text they have just read.
