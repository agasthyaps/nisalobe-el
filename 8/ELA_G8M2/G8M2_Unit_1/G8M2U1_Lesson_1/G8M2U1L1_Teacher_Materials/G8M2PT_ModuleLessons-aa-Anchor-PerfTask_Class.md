How do we make the right choices about what to eat? There are so many options and so much information, including conflicting information, about what Americans should do to make healthy food choices. It can be complex and confusing to decide just what to eat, and we need your help! Throughout this module, you researched and learned about how food is grown and processed, and how that impacts our health, nutrition, and environment. Based on your findings, you wrote an argumentative essay about one recommendation for your community to consider when making healthy and sustainable food choices.

For this performance task, you will create an infographic and speaking points to present that argument to your community. You will present your infographic to an audience in a roundtable setting, explaining your argument to inform them about how to make healthy and sustainable food choices, and why it is important to do so. You are the expert, and it is your turn to help your community make smart, informed, and healthy choices about what we eat!

**Your infographic will include**

- a clear recommendation for healthy and sustainable food choices;

- two reasons why your audience should consider your recommendation;

- two quotes or paraphrases from research texts that support each reason;

- a counterclaim that addresses the opposition to your claim/recommendation; and

- illustrations, images, or graphics that help convey your ideas.

This infographic can then be shared on social media, through email, on a website, or on bulletins in a school or local supermarket to help others learn about making healthy food choices.

**Your presentation will include**

- a 3-minute speech outlining the key points of your argument;

- domain-specific vocabulary to show your understanding of the topic;

- an infographic to visually represent your argument about an important food choice; and

- appropriate eye contact, adequate volume, and clear pronunciation when presenting your claims.
