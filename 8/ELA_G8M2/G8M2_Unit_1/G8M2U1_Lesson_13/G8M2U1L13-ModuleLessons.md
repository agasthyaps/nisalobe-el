Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- SL.8.2 – Opening A: Students view a video and determine the purpose and motive.

- RI.8.7 – Work Time A: Students review the Analyze Different Mediums anchor chart, naming advantages and disadvantages of using videos and infographics to convey a message.

- RI.8.7– Work Time B: Students answer questions to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of using infographics and text to convey a message about industrial farming.

- RI.8.9 – Closing and Assessment A: Students review two different texts that provide conflicting information on marbled beef and identify where the texts disagree or align.

- In this lesson, students practice becoming effective learners by showing perseverance as they explore the advantages and disadvantages of different mediums, as well as strengthen their reading and analysis skills. Students also deepen their collaboration strategies as they work with a variety of partners throughout the lesson.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- In this lesson, students review partial excerpts from *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* about industrial farming, meat production, and high-yield corn. Provide time for students to read and review the entire chapters with peers or individually, and explore additional texts or websites that also present information about this topic.

- In this lesson, students investigate infographics as a medium that conveys information. Invite students to pick a topic of interest to them (e.g., a sport, hobby, political or historical event) and then collect various infographics from books, magazines, the internet, etc., on that topic, comparing the advantages and disadvantages of the information they reveal.

- Invite students to research more about how infographics are used in advertising and food labels as a way to understand the purpose and motive behind their use.

- Suggest students research more about industrial farms and share findings with family members or peers.

- Invite students to explore various packaged food containers in their home such as chips, cereals, crackers, and canned goods, looking for the corn-based ingredients shown on pages 82–83, and to discuss the findings with their family members.

- Invite students to practice analyzing various accounts of a subject told in different mediums (e.g., videos of Bryant Terry from NourishLife and text from his cookbooks) and determining which details are emphasized in each account.

- Find seminal US documents of historical and literary significance (e.g., Washington’s Farewell Address, Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, Roosevelt’s Four Freedoms speech, or King’s Letter from Birmingham City Jail) that may connect to issues related to food justice, access to healthy food, and food choices, and support students to discuss how they address themes and concepts related to what they are learning in *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- As in the previous lesson, students revisit text excerpts from *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* alongside other mediums, analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of each. In the beginning of the unit, students identified an author’s or speaker’s point of view and purpose in texts and videos and delineated arguments. These lessons prepared students for the work they do in this lesson, identifying the purpose and motives behind each presentation of ideas and comparing information presented in texts.

Support All Students

- Note there is a differentiated version of the Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 13 used in Work Time B in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Presenting learning targets in writing, orally, and, if possible, accompanied by symbols will help students to understand the language within them. ▲

- Students watch a short video in Opening A. For students who may struggle with efficiently managing materials and engaging in this task, support them by working in a small group or projecting the video for the entire class to see at once. ▲

- In Opening A, show the video with English-language subtitles displayed to provide visual linguistic input. ▲

- Students may need additional support with recording their answers on their Analyze Mediums: Industrial Meat and Farming handout in Work Time B. As needed, group those students to support their growing independence with identifying advantages and disadvantages. ▲

- When grouping students in partners to review the anchor charts in Work Time A, group ELLs with partners who have more advanced or native language proficiency. The partners with greater language proficiency can serve as a model, initiating discussions and providing implicit sentence frames, for example. Use the same grouping in future lessons if this grouping was successful. This will support students in building trust and becoming more comfortable and confident with their peers. ▲

- In Work Time B, students read aloud excerpts from *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* in pairs. As needed, consider reading aloud to a small group of students and working with them as they answer their selected response questions to support their developing understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of different mediums. ▲

- Provide opportunities for students to review their answers in Work Time B using a method that supports or aligns to existing classroom routines. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson provides continued support with understanding motive in different mediums. Students also work to determine the advantages and disadvantages of different mediums and use a graphic organizer to gather information about a topic. Throughout the lesson, familiar repeated routines and anchor charts are integrated to help students carry out these tasks.

- ELLs may find it challenging to locate online information about local food independently. Pair students strategically, and use home-language groupings to support students in their work with the topic. As needed, provide suggestions about resources to allow students to focus on the information within them rather than the search itself.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.5, 8.I.B.6, 8.I.B.7, and 8.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- Monitor and collect students’ selected response questions during Work Time B to ensure students are on the right track as they answer questions related to the presentation of information in different mediums and the author’s motive. Similarly, collect students’ exit tickets from Closing and Assessment A to review their understanding of how two or more texts on a topic can present conflicting information. Review the collected student work and address any particular gaps in student understanding or specific questions that arise in the next lesson.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue to track the advantages and disadvantages of different mediums and answer selected and constructed response questions regarding author’s purpose and presentation of material in a variety of media. They will approach the work with increased independence, preparing them for the end of unit assessment in Lesson 15.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – SL.8.2 (10 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As they arrive, have students complete **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **1**, **Lesson** **13**. For ELLs and students who require additional support, **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **1**, **Lesson** **13** ▲can be used to help guide students’ thinking with selected response options. Also, display the **Purpose** **and** **Motives** **anchor** **chart** for students to consult as they complete the entrance ticket.

- If students do not have access to individual devices, display the video **“Cooking Together,”** playing it twice.

- Once students have watched the video and completed their entrance ticket, direct them to Turn and Talk with a partner, answering the following questions:

“What is Bryant Terry’s purpose for creating this video?” (He hopes to inform others of the health and social benefits of cooking and sharing healthy meals with others.)

“What do you think Bryant Terry’s motive is?” (Responses will vary, but students may infer that his motive was likely social because he finds enjoyment from eating and cooking with his family, and he wants others to benefit from this also. Or, because Bryant Terry writes cookbooks, his motive could be commercial, in hopes of selling more of his cookbooks.)

“How does the motive relate to his purpose?” (Responses will vary, but should show an understanding that his purpose of informing others about the health and social benefits of sharing healthy meals relates to his motive of wanting other people in society to experience the benefits of healthy eating.)

- Use a total participation technique to review student responses. Refer to the **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **1**, **Lesson** **13** (**answers** **for** **teacher** **reference**), and add any new information to the Purpose and Motives anchor chart.

- Using a preferred classroom routine, collect or review the answers to **Homework**: **Analyze** **Mediums**: **Industrial** **Organic** **Farming**. Refer to the **Homework**: **Analyze** **Mediums**: **Industrial** **Organic** **Farming** (**answers** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

- To help students internalize the difference between informing and convincing, provide them with a list of simple topics and invite them to spend 30 seconds taking turns convincing and informing a small group about each one:

- cell-phone use in the classroom

- note-taking strategies

- the length of summer vacation

- Guide students to share factual, unbiased information when informing others about each topic, and to adopt a persuasive, opinionated stance when convincing someone about the topic. As needed, invite proficient students to model the differences between the two for the class.

For Heavier Support

- Invite students who need heavier support to use Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 13▲. This resource has selected response options to help guide students’ thinking.

- To help students internalize the difference between informing and convincing, invite 2 or 3 highly proficient students to model the difference between informing and convincing using simple topics:

- cell-phone use in the classroom

- note-taking strategies

- the length of summer vacation

- Allow the class to discuss the differences they noticed between the two (informing = factual, unbiased information when informing others; convincing = a persuasive, opinionated stance or argument). As needed, invite proficient students to model the differences between the two for the class.

Work Time

A. Review Anchor Charts – RI.8.7 (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify advantages and disadvantages of using different mediums to present information on industrial meat and farming.”

- Display the **Analyze** **Different** **Mediums** **anchor** **chart**. Ask students to review the chart and then Think-Pair-Share:

“What are the advantages of using a video medium to convey a message about a topic, as in Bryant Terry’s video ‘Cooking Together’?” (Responses will vary, but may include that readers may connect to his message more readily because the calm yet enthusiastic body language he uses to share information can be more personable and help viewers connect with this message.)

- Explain to students that viewers need to be cautious consumers when watching videos or speeches to ensure that they are impacted by the content of the message being delivered, not by the connections they build to the person delivering the content. Speakers aim to build a personal connection with their audience, and while this is mostly used for valid purposes, this power has the potential to be manipulative in the wrong hands.

“What was Bryant Terry’s purpose? Was the medium of a video a helpful way to deliver that message?” (His purpose was to inform people of the benefits of eating healthy food together, and video is a medium that helps him because the video can be watched quickly and be easily shared with many people, further spreading his message.)

“What other mediums would also help him spread this message?” (Responses will vary, but may include that texts—printed written texts, like his cookbooks, or digital written, like blog posts—would also be successful with spreading his message.)

“Are there any disadvantages to using a video to convey information, as Bryant Terry did, on eating and cooking together?” (Responses will vary, but may include that the speed with which the material is presented could impact a viewer’s understanding, or that watching a video can be a passive activity and takes less thought and energy than actively reading, which could impact a viewer’s depth of understanding.)

- With student support, add these and any other related advantages and disadvantages of using the medium of video to the Analyze Different Mediums anchor chart and the Purpose and Motives anchor chart.

- Ask students to read the row heading “Infographic” on the Analyze Different Mediums anchor chart, and prompt them to Turn and Talk:

“What is an infographic?” (It is a visual image such as a chart or diagram that can include small captions of text, and it is used to represent information or data.)

“What kinds of infographics have you seen in the anchor texts or in other books you have read?” (Responses will vary.)

“What is the purpose of an infographic?” (Infographics present information in a visual way, which can be appealing to viewers and easier to understand.)

- With students’ support, record the meaning of the word *infographic* on the **academic** **word** **wall**. Invite students to record the term in their **vocabulary** **logs**.

- Direct students to retrieve their copies of ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma*** and open to page 85. Prompt students to examine the infographic titled “What’s in a Twinkie?”

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What is the purpose of this infographic?” (It informs readers about the ingredients in a Twinkie and specifically highlights the ingredients made from corn.)

“What is the motive behind the inclusion of this infographic?” (Responses will vary, but students may infer that Michael Pollan is skeptical about corn and that he wants others to know that food made of mostly heavily processed, corn-based ingredients is not healthy.)

“Are there any advantages or disadvantages to presenting information in this medium?” (Advantages: it is visually compelling, engages, and draws in the reader. The “bite-sized” bits of information are easy to retain. Disadvantages: it does not provide context—is corn in Twinkies a good or a bad thing? It leaves the reader with unanswered questions.)

- Cold-call on partners, and, with student support, add advantages and disadvantages of using infographics to the Analyze Different Mediums anchor chart. Use the **Analyze** **Different** **Mediums** **anchor** **chart** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as needed. Similarly, add any relevant notes to the Purpose and Motives anchor chart. Explain to students they will be analyzing the purpose along with the advantages and disadvantages of information presented in both infographics and text as they answer selected response questions in the Work Time B.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Work Time

B. Analyze Mediums: Industrial Meat and Farming – RI.8.7 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify advantages and disadvantages of using different mediums to present information about industrial meat and farming.”

- Direct students to page 37 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*. Prompt them to find a partner and read pages 37–39 aloud together, making sure to also read the infographics.

- Ask:

“What information was presented in these two mediums?” (The section explains how the rise of high-yield corn not only changed farming practices, but impacted the diversity of crops grown and the landscape and way of life of farming states like Iowa.)

- Explain to students that Michael Pollan could have just used one medium, but he chose to convey the information in two different mediums: two infographics and written text. Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What are the advantages of using each medium to present this information?” (Responses will vary, but may include: Both infographics and the text give important details about the changes in crop diversity due to the domination of corn. The infographics are easy to read and compelling. They make Pollan’s point “at a glance”; the central idea can be understood by reading the title and scanning the visual. The infographics convey a lot of information about the change in crop diversity and its effect on farmers in a short chart and in a map. The visual aspect of these helps the reader see the changes in crop diversity very quickly and clearly. The written text gives the reader additional details and shares a personal story of George Naylor’s grandfather and the crops available during his time as a farmer as compared to more recent times.)

“What are the disadvantages of using each medium to present this information?” (Responses will vary, but may include: A disadvantage of the infographics is that the level of detail is slim—questions may arise for the reader that are not answered in the information presented in them. Students may also mention that the text could deter some readers who are challenged by the content presented.)

- Inform students that they will now work with their partner to answer similar questions that relate to industrial farming. Display and distribute the **Analyze** **Mediums**: **Industrial** **Meat** **and** **Farming**. Read the directions aloud while students follow along, pausing to answer any questions and to clarify the task.

- While partners work, circulate and ensure students are on track, support struggling students as needed, and ensure all students are contributing and capturing their answers on their Analyze Mediums: Industrial Meat and Farming handout. Refer to the **Analyze** **Mediums**: **Industrial** **Meat** **and** **Farming** (**answers** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as needed.

- As students finish, prompt them to join another partner group, and review the answers using a preferred classroom routine. Use Analyze Mediums: Industrial Meat and Farming (answers for teacher reference) as needed.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time B, work together as a class to annotate the text prior to having students answer selected response questions by themselves. This will help to draw students’ attention to key information needed to analyze motive and advantages and disadvantages of different mediums and will also serve to build overall comprehension.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time B, distribute selected and constructed response questions with bolded and underlined key words to help students understand each question. If possible, distribute these questions in advance of the in-class reading in Work Time B so that students can use the questions to help guide their reading, helping them to look for specific information.

Closing and Assessment

A. Analyze Conflicting Information: Industrial Meat and Farming – RI.8.9 (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze two texts that provide conflicting information on industrial meat and farming and identify where they disagree on matters of fact or interpretation.”

- Explain that sometimes information presented about one topic in multiple texts can be conflicting. Authors can share evidence or interpretations that disagree with one another. This can make it difficult for the reader to know what to believe or what sources to trust. Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“Have you ever seen or heard conflicting information on a topic before?” (Responses will vary.)

- Give students a concrete example of conflicting information by sharing how meteorologists often present varying weather forecasts to the public based on the same weather facts. For instance, two meteorologists in the same area can analyze weather patterns or data, observe current conditions, and both predict rain in the local forecast. They might, however, disagree on when the rain will start or how much rain will fall. This example illustrates how two well-intentioned sources can still disagree about some facts, which can make it difficult for consumers to know if they are getting accurate information. In cases like this, the reader may need to consult additional reliable sources. Because of this, it is important for readers to pay attention to the sources of information and consider their motive and purpose in presenting the material.

- Ask:

“What strategies can readers use to help them know what to trust or believe in the texts they read?” (Responses will vary, but may include: readers can evaluate the source of the text, readers can review several texts on the same topic, readers can look at the motive or purpose behind the author’s work, etc.)

- Direct students to the infographic on page 71 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*. Read the section about corn-fed beef aloud, starting at “Advertisers use the phrase” and stopping at “healthy for us to eat corn-fed cattle.” Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What is ‘marbled’ beef?” (Meat from corn-fed cattle becomes marbled, which means it contains many veins of white fat.)

“What is Michael Pollan’s interpretation of beef marbled with fat?” (He thinks that marbled beef is a bad choice. This beef is corn-fed, contains unhealthy fats, and he believes the meat is less healthy for us.)

- Explain to students that when you searched for more information about marbled beef, you came across a site like http://eled.org/0235. Tell students that both this new source and the information from *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* comment on marbled beef and agree about what it is, yet they give conflicting information about the fat quality of marbled beef. Display, or direct students to this online text or a similar text via internet links, and prompt students to read the digital text with their partner, working to identify where it provides conflicting information.

- Ask students to capture their thinking regarding the conflicting ideas presented in the texts in **Exit** **Ticket**: **Unit** **1**, **Lesson** **13**. Distribute the exit ticket, and circulate as students work. Refer to **Exit** **Ticket**: **Unit** **1**, **Lesson** **13** (**answers** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as needed.

- As students complete the exit ticket, ask them to identify where they see these texts presenting conflicting ideas. Think-Pair-Share:

“In what ways do the texts present conflicting interpretations about beef marbled with fat?” (The text from Texas A&M interprets the fat in marbled beef as being a good thing because it makes the beef flavorful and juicy. Michael Pollan interprets the fat in marbled beef as being unhealthy, and therefore a bad thing for consumers.)

“How do these differences in interpretation relate to the purpose and/or motives each author might have for presenting the information?” (Responses will vary, but may include: Michael Pollan’s purpose is to inform consumers about how to make healthy food choices, and his interpretation that the fat content in marbled beef is a negative thing aligns to this purpose. The writers of the Texas A&M text are informing their audience of the benefits of marbled beef, so pointing out the varied positive characteristics like juicier taste and enhanced eating experiences aligns to their purpose.)

- Explain to students that consumers are often presented with conflicting information of this sort, which presents challenges for people who are trying to make informed decisions. Ask students:

“What reactions do you have to the conflicting interpretations presented in these two texts?” (Responses will vary, but may include that conflicting interpretations of a topic or fact, like the conflicting view of beef that contains marbled fat, makes understanding the topic confusing. When two different sources say conflicting things, it is hard to know which source to trust. In this case, it is difficult to know if marbled beef is a good food to consume when it is interpreted as both tasty and unhealthy by two different sources.)

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well in their collaboration and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent** **reading** **journal**.
