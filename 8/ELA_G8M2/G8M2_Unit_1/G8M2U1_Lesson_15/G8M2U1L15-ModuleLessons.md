Grade 8: Module 2: Unit 1: Lesson 15

Lesson Overview

Lesson Summary

In this lesson, students take their end of unit assessment and analyze the purpose and motives for expressing information as well as the advantages and disadvantages of using different mediums, also analyzing cases in which two sources provide conflicting information.

CCS Standards

Focus Standards

These are the standards the instruction addresses.

- RI.8.1, RI.8.7, RI.8.9, SL.8.2

Supporting Standards

These are the standards that are incidental—no direct instruction in this lesson, but practice of these standards occurs as a result of addressing the focus standards.

- RI.8.10, L.8.6

Daily Learning Targets

- I can evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of using different mediums to present information about the price of healthy food. (RI.8.7)

- I can analyze the purpose of information presented in digital print and video format and evaluate the motives (e.g., social, commercial, political) behind its presentation. (SL.8.2)

- I can analyze how “No Free Lunch” and “Is Eating Healthy Really More Expensive?” provide conflicting information about the cost of healthy food and identify where these sources disagree on matters of fact or interpretation. (RI.8.9)

Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- In the End of Unit 1 Assessment in Work Time A, students answer selected response questions about the advantages and disadvantages of digital print and video to portray information about the cost of healthy food, the purpose of the information presented, and how the two sources disagree. (RI.8.1, RI.8.7, RI.8.9, SL.8.2)

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners by reading and answering questions independently for the end of unit assessment.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Ask students to reflect on their growth or learning between the mid-unit assessment and the end of unit assessment. Also, ask students to create goals for the coming unit.

- Add additional questions about the advantages and disadvantages of different mediums, the purpose of the information presented, and how sources disagree on matters of fact of interpretation for students who finish early.

- Students might watch additional videos, listen to audio, read additional texts, or look at pictures of infographics and consider the advantages, disadvantages, and purposes of these different mediums and presentations of information, as well as how they may disagree.

- In higher grade levels, RI.7 requires students to analyze the same story (such as someone’s life story) told through different mediums and compare the details emphasized. Students might choose a memoir or autobiography that is also a film and compare the two cases.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the first half of the unit, students read print text and watched videos while learning to analyze structure and purpose and to delineate and evaluate arguments. In the second half of the unit, students analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of using those mediums, considering the author’s purpose for presenting information and how different sources may disagree. In this lesson, students continue to use those skills in an assessment.

Support All Students

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment.

- For some students, this assessment may require more than the 35 minutes allotted. Provide time over multiple days if necessary.

- To support ELLs, this lesson has an End of Unit 1 Assessment that contains questions that closely mirror the selected and constructed response questions students have had practice with in lessons. Students consider the advantages and disadvantages of using different mediums to present ideas about where our food comes from, analyze how two resources provide conflicting information on the same topic, and consider how information on food is presented through these different mediums.

- ELLs may find it challenging to complete the assessment independently. Before the assessment, build in time to revisit the key concepts that students will be assessed on and review selected and constructed response questions from previous lessons, as needed. Review the Analyze Different Mediums anchor chart to activate students’ knowledge immediately prior to the assessment.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.A.1, 8.I.A.3, 8.I.B.5, and 8.I.C.9.

Assessment Guidance

- All assessment materials (student prompt and teacher checklist) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback on this assessment, use the answer key and sample student responses (see Assessment Overview and Resources).

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will begin to conduct their own research as they explore the topic of GMOs.

- Students’ End of Unit 1 Assessments will be returned in Unit 2, Lesson 7 with feedback.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Return students’ **Module** **2** **Mid** - **Unit** **1** **Assessments** **with** **feedback**.

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **1**, **Lesson** **15**. This entrance ticket prompts students to review their feedback from Mid-Unit 1 Assessment. Invite students to spend a few minutes reading the feedback and then filling out the reflection questions on the entrance ticket. If they require support to understand the feedback, encourage them to write their names on the board for a one-on-one review. Remind students that everyone is working toward individual goals and that learning is about continued growth and development.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. End of Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze the Purpose of Information, Evaluate Mediums, and Analyze Conflicting Information in Video and Text (35 minutes)

- Review the learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of using different mediums to present information about the price of healthy food.”

“I can analyze the purpose of information presented in digital print and video format and evaluate the motives (e.g., social, commercial, political) behind its presentation.”

“I can analyze how ‘No Free Lunch’ and ‘Is Eating Healthy Really More Expensive?’ provide conflicting information about the cost of healthy food and identify where these sources disagree on matters of fact or interpretation.”

- Distribute **End** **of** **Unit** **1** **Assessment**: **Analyze** **the** **Purpose** **of** **Information**, **Evaluate** **Mediums**, **and** **Analyze** **Conflicting** **Information** **in** **Video** **and** **Text**.

- Tell students that for this assessment, they will read a new text and watch a new video and answer selected response questions about the advantages and disadvantages of digital print and video to portray information about the cost of healthy food, the purpose of the information presented, and how the two sources disagree.

- Read the directions for each part of the assessment aloud as students read along silently. Answer clarifying questions.

- Direct students’ attention to the following anchor charts:

- **Close** **Readers** **Do** **These** **Things** **anchor** **chart**

- **Strategies** **to** **Answer** **Selected** **Response** **Questions** **anchor** **chart**

- Remind students to refer to these anchor charts as they read the assessment text and answer the assessment questions.

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence. Focus students on the **Work** **to** **Become** **Effective** **Learners** **anchor** **chart**, and review what perseverance looks and sounds like. Remind students that because they will be reading and answering questions independently for the assessment, they may need to practice perseverance.

- Invite students to begin the assessment.

- If students do not have access to individual devices, display the video **“No Free Lunch,”** playing it twice, once students have had ample time to read the article in Part I of the assessment.

For Lighter Support

- Before the assessment, underline key vocabulary in the assessment directions and prompt, and read aloud together as a class to ensure that students understand each task included in the assessment. Invite students who need lighter support to restate or clarify information for students who need heavier support. Review key terms (*medium*, *conflicting*, *advantage*, *disadvantage*) aloud, and consider providing a glossary of terms that students can refer back to as needed to help them stay grounded while answering the questions on the assessment.

For Heavier Support

- Display a “map” of the assessment to reference while explaining directions to the end of unit assessment. This will reduce ambiguity and give students a clearer picture of what they can expect so that they can better allocate their time and attentional resources. Provide students with colored pencils or highlighters so that they can mark up the “map” as needed. Example:

- Read the article.

- Answer the questions about the advantages and disadvantages of this medium.

- Watch the video two times, and take notes.

- Answer the questions about how the information conflicts with the information in the article.

Closing and Assessment

A. Reflect on Learning Targets (5 minutes)

- Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets, using a checking for understanding technique—for example, showing thumbs-up or traffic light signal cards. Scan students’ responses, and make a note of students who might need support. Check in with them moving forward.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- As in Lessons 9–10, after the assessment, ask students to write or discuss which assessment task was easiest and which was most difficult, and why. In future lessons and for homework, focus on the language skills that help students address these assessment challenges.

For Heavier Support

- As in Lessons 9–10, provide students with a **sheet of paper** on which they can use a selected color, number, or symbol to self-assess against each learning target in private. This provides useful data for future instruction and helps students monitor their own learning.

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent** **reading** **journal**.
