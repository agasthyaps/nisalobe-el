- Cows and the grasses they eat have a natural, sustaining ecological partnership—the plants use the sun’s energy to make grass, and the cows eat the grass and in turn fertilize and plant new grasses.

- Cows have a specialized stomach (rumen) that allows them to break down the grasses they eat and turn them into necessary proteins and carbohydrates.

- A steer can grow from 80 to 1,100 pounds by eating corn in just sixteen months. Cows that eat grass take longer to mature and grow than cows raised on corn.

- Feedlots are beef factories that turn corn into beef.

- Ingredients that are accepted in chicken and cattle feed include protein from other types of animals, such as: ground-up cattle brains, tallow, feather meal, chicken meal, pig meal, and chicken litter.

- Feeding corn to cattle goes against their foraging nature and is making them sick.

- Cows can get conditions such as bloat or acidosis from eating too much corn.

- Most cattle raised in feedlots need antibiotics to keep them healthy.
