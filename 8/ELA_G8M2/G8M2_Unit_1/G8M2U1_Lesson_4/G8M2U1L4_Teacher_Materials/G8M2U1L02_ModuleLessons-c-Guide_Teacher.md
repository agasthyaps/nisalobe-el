Unit 1

**Lesson 2, Section 1**

Introduction, pages 10–13

Pause to define the following vocabulary and ask the following questions as needed.

- page 11 “Instead we have dozens of different ‘experts’ . . .”

> **Why do you think the author placed the word *experts* in quotation marks? What can you infer by this choice? Answers will vary, but may include: the author doesn’t trust experts, the author doesn’t believe there can be experts on food, the author doesn’t think the experts are credible.**

- pages 12–13 “In this book, I follow four different food chains.”

> **What have we learned about the four food chains the author is following? Answers will vary, but may include: there are many ways our food is grown, produced, and sold to us; food is grown in large, single-crop fields, in chemical-free farms, in local small farms; people hunt and grow their own food.**

- page 36 “Even if farmers face hard times . . .”

> **How do agribusinesses profit from farmers? Answers will vary, but may include: in order to continue to produce hybrid plants with good traits, farmers have to keep buying seeds from seed companies.**

- page 49 “Prices go lower, but the mountain of corn . . .”

> **Why aren’t farmers making money? Answers will vary, but may include: They receive checks from the government to only grow corn, but the price of corn is lower than the cost of growing corn. They are not paid to grow other crops.**

**Lesson 4, Section 3**

Pages 63–65: starting at “Cows and Grass—A Partnership” and ending at “. . . fast food indeed” just prior to “Cow Chow”

Pages 69–74: starting at “Cattle Eating Cattle” and ending at “. . . I wouldn’t have a job” just prior to “My Steer”

Pause to define the following vocabulary and ask the following questions as needed.

**Vocabulary**

- ruminants (64): even-toed hoofed mammals (such as sheep, oxen, deer, and camels) that chew the cud and have a complex three- or four-chambered stomach

- fermentation (64): the chemical breakdown of a substance by bacteria, yeasts, or other microorganisms

- ecological system (or ecosystem) (65): The living organisms in a specific area that interact and depend on one another for functioning and survival. These systems are the plants and animals interacting with their nonliving environments (weather, Earth, Sun, soil, atmosphere).

- acidosis (72): when body tissues contain too much acid

**Questions**

- page 65 “A rumen has evolved into . . .”

> **If cattle are not good at digesting corn, why is the author suggesting they are fed corn as their primary diet? Answers will vary, but may include: cows that are fed corn can be fattened, and therefore slaughtered, more quickly when they have a corn-based diet.**

- page 70 “Basically, almost all of the cattle . . .”

> **What does this excerpt mean? Why does corn make cattle sick? Answers may vary, but should explain that cows have specialized stomachs that are made to eat grass, and when they eat only a corn-fed diet, they develop illnesses, such as bloat and acidosis.**

- page 74 “What keeps a feedlot animal . . .”

> **What is the relationship of antibiotics to feedlot animals? Answers may vary, but should explain that cattle raised in feedlots could not survive without antibiotics. They need antibiotics because the acid in their stomachs eats away the walls of their rumen and allows bacteria to enter their bloodstream. This can cause damage to their livers and is treated with antibiotics.**

- pages 88–89 “Processing food allows companies to . . .”

> **How do companies get us to spend more money for the same amount of food? Answers will vary, but may include: they use advertising to persuade us, they present foods as if they have added value, they make them appealing, they add vitamins.**

- page 91 “Three of every five Americans . . .”

> **What is the danger of eating more calories? It causes obesity and diabetes, which are conditions that are killing us.**

- page 98 “You begin to see why processing foods . . .”

> **How do processed foods make us eat more than we should? Humans will eat more sugar and fat even when we’re full since our bodies tell us to eat more because we will be hungry again soon.**

**Questions**

- page 133 “Because this food chain has elements of both, I call it ‘industrial organic.’”

> **What does Pollan mean when he refers to this organic food as “industrial organic”? He is referring to the fact that although the food he is describing is organic and is produced without pesticides, it is still produced in an industrial setting.**

- page 134 “The government rules about organic food allow companies to make organic high-fructose corn syrup—words I never expected to see combined.”

> **Why was Pollan surprised to see these words combined? He was surprised because one typically thinks of organic food as healthy food, not food that would contain HFCS.**

- page 148 “Ah, you ask, what about the ‘free range’ words on Rosie’s label? Doesn’t that mean they can ‘free range’ outside? Not exactly.”

> **What does Pollan mean by “not exactly”? He means that although these chickens are technically labelled as “free range,” they are accustomed to not going outside, and by the time the option exists to go outside, the chickens are conditioned to stay indoors and most do so.**

- page 180 “The last time I had stood watching . . .”

> **What is the difference between Poky Feeders and the cows on Joel’s farm? Poky Feeders have a longer food chain because they use machines to harvest the feed, but the cows on Joel’s farm harvest their own feed.**

- page 195 “Salatin reached down deep . . .”

> **On page 195, the author states, “That handful of compost was proof that when grass can eat sunlight and food animals can eat grass, there is indeed a free lunch.” What does this quote mean? This process doesn’t include the cost of machines, so the natural farming process of grass using sunlight and animals eating grass to produce food, does not cost any money.**

**Questions**

- page 215 “Joel pointed out that people generally understand that quality costs more, except when it comes to food.”

> **What is the author trying to point out by sharing Joel’s observation? He is sharing the discrepancy many Americans exhibit when it comes to quality and cost. He gives examples of how people will pay for cable or new TVs while resisting the cost of higher-quality food. Just like higher-quality cars and clothing cost more money, consumers should expect that higher-quality food cost more as well.**

- page 221 “We can vote with our forks.”

> **What does it mean to “vote with your fork”? People can make big changes in the food system through the choices they make when purchasing and consuming food.**

Unit 3

- page 42 “. . . it wasn’t until farmers started using chemical fertilizers in the 1950s that corn yields really exploded.”

> **Why do you think the author used the word *exploded* to describe a high amount of corn being grown? Answers will vary, but may include: The increase in corn produced was due to the use of chemicals that are also used to make bombs. The author is making a subtle joke here.**

- page 44 “But the system only works as long as fossil fuel energy is cheap.”

> **What have we learned about how factory farms use fossil fuels? Why might this be a problem? Answers will vary, but may include: Factory farms use up more fossil fuel energy than the amount of food that they produce. This could become a problem for our ecosystem as we continue to use up resources to sustain this type of farming.**

**Lesson 2, Section 9**

Pages 44–46, beginning with “Nitrogen Pollution,” and ending with “Rich Fields, Poor Farmers”

Pause to define the following vocabulary and ask the following questions as needed.

**Questions**

- page 63 “Cows have evolved . . . to be eaten by cows.”

> **What are some of the ways that cows have evolved to eat grass, and what are some of the ways grass has evolved to be eaten by cows? Answers will vary, but may include: cows have a specialized stomach that allows them to eat grass; cows eat the grass and also fertilize it, allowing more grasses to grow.**

- page 71 “Yet this corn-fed meat is actually less healthy for us.”

> **In what ways is corn-fed beef less healthy for consumers to eat? Answers will vary, but may include: it has too much saturated fat, which is linked to heart disease, and fewer “good fats” like omega-3 fatty acids.**
