Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- L.8.4c – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket by consulting a dictionary to determine the meanings of words associated with delineating arguments.

- RI.8.8 – Work Time B: With guidance, students complete sections of their Delineate an Argument: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 3 graphic organizer to review and evaluate the argument and claims in the excerpt.

- RI.8.8: Closing and Assessment A: Students self-assess their understanding of how to delineate an argument.

- The Think-Pair-Share protocol is used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of the curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- In this lesson, students practice becoming effective learners, showing perseverance as they learn how to delineate and evaluate arguments and analyze the nuances of their validity. This will help students strengthen their reading and analysis skills and will make them better able to formulate their own opinions and arguments.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- In this lesson, students read excerpts from chapter 5 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*. Provide time for students to read and review the entire chapter with peers or individually.

- Invite students to research more about factory farms, feedlots, and animal processing to better understand the history of industrial meat. Students can share what they learn through these interviews in small groups or with the class.

- As appropriate for students, introduce the Delineate an Argument: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 3 graphic organizer in Work Time B with more or less scaffolding.

- Additional text excerpts from *Chew* *on* *This* by Eric Schlosser and Charles Wilson discuss similar topics as section 3 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* and add depth and further foundational understanding about topics such as feedlots, slaughterhouses, industrial food processing, and the meat industry for students. Provide opportunities for students to read pages 151–156 and 159–163 of *Chew* *on* *This*, and have them identify the arguments presented and analyze the relevance and sufficiency of the evidence and the soundness of the reasoning used in support of the arguments.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students examined the structure of specific paragraphs in the anchor text and analyzed how the structure contributed to developing key ideas in the text. Students also discussed the author’s point of view and examined how the author responded to or acknowledged conflicting evidence and viewpoints. During this lesson, students dig deeper into the author’s point of view by analyzing arguments he raises in a section of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*. Students learn to identify a claim, its supporting points, evidence, and reasoning. They also begin to evaluate whether the evidence is relevant and sufficient and the reasoning is sound.

Support All Students

- Presenting learning targets in writing, orally, and, if possible, accompanied by symbols, will help students to understand the language within them. ▲

- Note that section 3 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* brings up potentially sensitive topics such as slaughtering animals, CAFOs (Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations), and references to animal treatment at feedlots. Pollan describes how some cattle on feedlots are fed parts of other animals and other unnatural ingredients. Pollan also suggest that cows should eat grass and not corn. He suggests that the cows’ diet makes them sick and that, when they are fed antibiotics, this is unhealthy for the environment and possibly humans. Some students and their families may have differing opinions from what Pollan suggests or may find these topics new or challenging based on their own knowledge and eating or shopping habits. Some students and their families may find these topics upsetting. Allow time for students to process or respond to these topics during individual, small group, or full class discussion, and reach out to families as needed.

- In Work Time A, provide choice in how students read the excerpt: some students may prefer to read independently and silently, while others (especially ELLs) may wish to read aloud in groups with peers and/or with support. Still others may wish to read silently for a few pages and then process with a group. This format of choice could potentially be built into the reading time within each lesson. ▲

- As in previous lessons, in Work Time A, present additional options for recording gist rather than just the sticky note, such as using a separate notebook, using a graphic organizer, using highlighters and annotating, or using a voice recorder. Give students options for expressing their understanding of gist (oral, written, drawing). Also, build in different options for expressing comprehension of the text (written reflection, voice recording, discussion with partners/groups). ▲

- When grouping students in partners to review the Delineate an Argument: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 3 graphic organizer in Work Time B, group ELLs with partners who have more advanced or native language proficiency. The partners with greater language proficiency can serve as a model, initiating discussions and providing implicit sentence frames, for example. Use the same grouping in future lessons if this grouping was successful. This will support students in building trust and becoming more comfortable and confident with their peers. ▲

- When reviewing the Delineate an Argument: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 3 graphic organizer in Work Time B, refrain from explaining the sections related to irrelevant evidence and conflicting viewpoints. Those will be analyzed in detail in a future lesson.

- To support ELLs, this lesson includes supported in-class reading of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, an introduction to delineating an argument, and work with a partially filled-in graphic organizer used to analyze an argument. Students consider why it’s important to delineate an argument and engage in discussion to consider the relevance and sufficiency of evidence. Repeated routines throughout the lesson support students in navigating these tasks.

- ELLs may find it challenging to understand portions of the text. Encourage students to apply vocabulary strategies and to use a dictionary, as needed, to determine the meanings of unfamiliar words. Students can also use embedded graphics within the texts to help them better understand the information they encounter. While showing the video in Closing and Assessment A, use English-language subtitles to provide an added layer of input for students.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6, 8.I.B.7, 8.I.B.8, and 8.II.B.4.

Assessment Guidance

- Check gist statements to ensure students are recording quick notes about what the text is mostly about.

- Monitor students’ Delineate an Argument: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 3 graphic organizer work in Work Time B to ensure students are capturing accurate main claims, supporting points, and related evidence as identified with guidance.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will analyze the Delineate an Argument: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 3 graphic organizer in more detail, focusing on identifying irrelevant evidence and conflicting viewpoints. In future lessons, students will go back to examining the structure of specific paragraphs in *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, analyzing how the structure contributes to developing key ideas in the text. Students will also discuss the author’s point of view and examine how the author responds to or acknowledges conflicting evidence and viewpoints prior to having another lesson on delineating argument and analyzing evidence in Lesson 6.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.8.4c (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As they arrive, students complete **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **1**, **Lesson** **4**.

- Prompt students to Turn and Talk about their responses on the entrance ticket, using the following questions:

“What is the meaning of the word *delineate*?” (Students should identify that *delineate* means to describe something in detail and with precision.)

“What is the meaning of the word *argument*?” (Students should identify that *argument* means an assertion or opinion and its supporting points, evidence, and reasoning.)

- Cold Call on students to share out the definitions they determined. With students’ support, record the meanings of the terms *delineate* and *argument* on the **academic** **word** **wall**. Invite students to record the terms in their **vocabulary** **logs**. Refer to the **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **1**, **Lesson** **4** (**answers** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Using a preferred classroom routine, collect or review the answers to **Homework**: **Analyze** **Author’s** **Purpose** **and** **Point** **of** **View**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma***, **Section** **2**. Refer to **Homework**: **Analyze** **Author’s** **Purpose** **and** **Point** **of** **View**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma***, **Section** **2** (**answers** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as needed.

Work Time

A. Read *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 3, and Track Gist and Key Details (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same process as with previous lessons for students to read section 3 of ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma*** using the **Text** **Guide**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma*** (**for** **teacher** **reference**). Instruct students to read the sections independently, and support struggling students as needed. If students do not finish reading the section within the allotted reading time, distribute the **Synopsis**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma,*** **Section** **3** to each student to review the key details from the section. As time permits, have students identify the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary, reflect on their reading as they choose, and record the gist on **sticky** **notes** using the following resources as appropriate: vocabulary logs, academic word wall, and **Work** **to** **Become** **Effective** **Learners** **anchor** **chart**.

- After students read the section, ask them to Think-Pair-Share about the gist they determined:

“What is the gist of section 3?” (Cattle have evolved to eat grass, yet on feedlots cows eat corn. Cows get sick from corn they eat; they require antibiotics. Raising cattle in feedlots impacts health and environment.)

- Prompt students to share their reactions to this section of text, by asking them to Think-Pair-Share:

“What were some of your reactions to things the author talked about in section 3?” (Responses will vary, but may include: disgust or surprise that cattle are fed corn because it fattens them rapidly, or that feedlots are considered beef factories, or how cows can get multiple sicknesses from eating corn and other feedlot ingredients.)

“What are you interested to learn more about now?” (Responses will vary, but may include: feedlots and their practices.)

“What questions did this section bring up for you?” (Responses will vary, but may mention questions about why cattle are still fed corn if they get sick.)

- Allow time for questions and address any misconceptions students have about this text section.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

B. Delineate an Argument – RI.8.8 (20 minutes)

- Review the learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can delineate the argument in a section of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*.”

“I can evaluate an argument, assessing whether Michael Pollan’s reasoning is sound and the evidence presented on the topic of industrial farming is relevant and sufficient.”

- Inform students that they will now use a graphic organizer to delineate an argument in *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*. Direct students to Turn and Talk:

“What does the title ‘Delineate an Argument’ mean to you? What will you be doing on this graphic organizer?” (Responses will vary, but students should review their entrance ticket as needed, and determine that delineating an argument means they will be figuring out the author’s specific argument and using details to describe it.)

“Why is it important to delineate the arguments in this module’s texts?” (Responses will vary, but could suggest that because the author of our anchor text, Michael Pollan, includes his own claims about the information he is writing about, it will be important to understand them and compare them to arguments in alternate texts, or information from our background knowledge on the topic.)

“When might you need to look closely at arguments, and delineate them, in your own lives, and why?” (Responses will vary, but students should relate this to real life with examples such as: we need to look closely at the campaign materials peers present when they are running for student government to understand whether we agree with them before voting.)

- Explain to students that when they delineate arguments in *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, it will be important to consider how Michael Pollan’s point of view on the information shapes his claims. Instruct students to retrieve their **Author’s** **Purpose** **and** **Point** **of** **View**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma*** **note** - **catcher** and identify the author’s point of view from this section on the note-catcher. Refer to the **Author’s** **Purpose** **and** **Point** **of** **View**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma*** **note** - **catcher** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**). Prompt students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What is Michael Pollan’s point of view in section 3 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*?” (Responses will vary but may identify that Michael Pollan believes industrial farming comes at a high cost to animals, health, and the environment, and he believes there is a better way to raise beef.)

- Discuss with students the connections between analyzing arguments and the point-of-view work done in previous lessons.

“In the previous lesson, we analyzed the author’s point of view on topics throughout *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*. We determined the author’s attitude toward food choices, corporations, and other key concepts. Additionally, we looked at conflicting viewpoints—how the author responded to certain viewpoints and popular opinions different from his own. Now we will dig deeper into the author’s point of view by analyzing how his point of view is related to the main claim when he makes an argument in the text.”

- Prompt students to find a partner, and display and distribute the **Delineate** **an** **Argument**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma***, **Section** **3** **graphic** **organizer**.

- Focus students on the top of the document, and tell them the graphic organizer has been partially filled out already. It begins by identifying the author’s purpose and main claim of this section. Remind students that Michael Pollan’s purpose is to describe the industrial farming approach to raising beef.

- Explain that a *claim* is a statement of opinion that can be proved or disproved with evidence and reasoning. Invite students to record the word in their vocabulary logs, and capture the definition on the academic word wall.

- Read the main claim section aloud as students follow along. Explain that in *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Pollan does not come right out and state his claim as authors sometimes do. Instead, he implies his claim throughout the text sections. Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“How does understanding Michael Pollan’s point of view help you understand, or identify, his claim?” (Responses will vary but should identify that knowing his point of view helps a reader anticipate the claims he will make in his writing, and it can help a reader infer the claims from the information in the text.)

- Remind students that when they write essays, they need to support their focus with points and evidence. In *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Pollan needs to do that, too. He needs to support his claim with points and evidence. Tell students that the graphic organizer tracks Pollan’s implied claim and provides space for supporting points and evidence related to each point.

- Using **equity** **sticks**, call on a student to read supporting point 1 aloud, and have students underline it in their graphic organizer. Call on another student to read supporting point 2 aloud, and have students underline it on their graphic organizer. Explain to students that in order to support these points, Pollan needs to provide relevant evidence so that readers will understand and believe the points he presents to support his claim.

- Ask students:

“What does the word *relevant* mean? What is relevant evidence?” (*Relevant* means something that is connected or applicable. Relevant evidence is connected to the claim and helps illuminate the point being made to the reader.)

- Invite students to record the word *relevant* in their vocabulary logs, and capture the definition on the academic word wall.

- Focus students back on their Delineate an Argument: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 3 graphic organizer, and direct students to read the relevant evidence connected to point 1 aloud to a partner.

- Ask:

“Why is this evidence relevant to supporting point 1?” (Discussions will vary, but should point out that the evidence directly relates to cows getting sick from their corn-based diet. The evidence is related, makes sense, and it helps the reader understand the point being made.)

- Complete the same step for point 2, asking students to read the relevant evidence connected to point 2 aloud to one another and discuss how it is relevant. (Discussions will vary, but should point out that the evidence directly relates to cows being fed parts of other animals and getting sick from it. The evidence is related, makes sense, and it helps the reader understand the point being made.)

- Move on to the section in the graphic organizer labeled “Sufficient Evidence.” Explain to students that *sufficient* means enough or adequate.

- Ask students to Turn and Talk, deepening their understanding of the word *sufficient*:

“Imagine that it is snowing and -20 degrees, and your friend wants to go outside and play basketball in a T-shirt. Why won’t a T-shirt be sufficient to stay warm in the weather?” (Responses should mention that the clothing won’t prepare the friend for the elements and won’t be enough to keep the friend warm.)

“Now, think of the sufficiency of evidence. Is the evidence in this section of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* presented ‘sufficient’? Why or why not?” (Responses will vary, but may include: Yes, the evidence is sufficient because it presents enough information that helps the reader understand practices at feedlots. It makes readers consider the negative aspects of industrial farming practices, and it helps them understand that the claim that there are better ways to raise beef than in an industrial setting makes sense.)

- Invite students to record the word in their vocabulary logs, and capture the definition on the academic word wall. Cold-call on students to share their responses with their peers, and reiterate any important takeaways regarding the sufficiency of evidence. Direct students to work with their partner to capture a brief response in this section of the graphic organizer. For possible responses, see the **Delineate** **an** **Argument**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma***, **Section** **3** **graphic** **organizer** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Refer students to the section of their graphic organizer aligned to sound reasoning. Read aloud the sample response while students follow along. Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What is addressed in this response?” (It discusses the soundness of reasoning from this section of text.)

- Explain that *reasoning* is the explanation of why a claim is true, including explanations of how the evidence given proves the claim. Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“Why is it important for a writer to include reasoning? What might happen if there were no reasoning included in sections of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*?” (Responses will vary, but may include that readers could be confused by evidence and not have a full understanding of the claim he was trying to support. It could lead to a confusing or incomplete argument.)

“What is meant by ‘sound reasoning’?” (Responses will vary, but students should understand that sound reasoning is reasoning that is clear, makes sense, describes the evidence, and helps the reader connect the evidence back to the claim.)

- Reiterate that this answer explains the soundness of the reasoning presented in this section of text. Ensure students understand that in this response they will analyze the author’s reasoning and explain how the author further examines and describes the evidence presented, connects it back to the claim, and helps the reader believe that the claim could be true.

- Invite students to record the words *reasoning* and *sound* in their vocabulary logs, and capture the definitions on the academic word wall.

- As needed, ask students to review pages 72–73 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* and discuss the roles of particular sentences to help them understand Pollan’s reasoning more deeply as they discuss their responses.

- Explain to students that they will complete the final two questions on the graphic organizer in the next lesson.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Closing and Assessment

A. Thumb-O-Meter and Pair Share – RI.8.8 (5 minutes)

- Review the learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can delineate the argument in a section of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*.”

“I can evaluate an argument, assessing whether Michael Pollan’s reasoning is sound and the evidence presented on the topic of industrial farming is relevant and sufficient.”

- Remind students that in this lesson they examined a model, or completed version, of the Delineate an Argument: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 3 graphic organizer. Explain that later in the module, they will use this same graphic organizer with a partner and apply it to a new section of text excerpts from *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*.

- Prompt students to review the learning targets, and ask them to show a Thumb-O-Meter, gauging how prepared they are to do this work with a partner. Thumbs up indicates that they feel prepared and ready to dive in to the work; thumbs down indicates that they feel like they would need a lot of additional tools or support to do this work with a partner; and thumbs to the side signals they are somewhat prepared, but might need support.

- Invite students to Pair-Share where they put their thumbs and why, and cold-call on a few students to share out.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Delineate Arguments

- Students answer selected response questions to complete **Homework**: **Delineate** **Arguments**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma***, **Section** **3**.
