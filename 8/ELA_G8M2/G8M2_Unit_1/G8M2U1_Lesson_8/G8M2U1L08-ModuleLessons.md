Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.8.6 – Work Time B: Students analyze the author’s purpose and point of view.

- RI.8.6 – Closing and Assessment A: Students answer a question focused on the author’s point of view.

- The Think-Pair-Share protocol is used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of the curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Students could read chapters 12, 13, and 14 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* and analyze the author’s point of view on other food topics in the text.

- Students can research local sustainability and even local farms and farmers markets in their area. Students can conduct interviews with local farmers, visit farms, or use the internet to conduct their research.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students analyzed the author’s purpose and point of view in *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*. In this lesson, students continue this analysis.

Support All Students

- Presenting learning targets in writing, orally, and, if possible, accompanied by symbols, will help students to understand the language within them. ▲

- Note that section 6 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* brings up the topic of grass farming and posits this as a natural way to keep animals happy and healthy. Some students or their families may find this topic to be new, challenging, or even frustrating depending on their own eating habits, knowledge, access, or other factors. Allow for time to process and respond to these topics during individual, small group, or full class discussion, and reach out to families as needed. Use thoughtful strategic pairing for discussions around these topics to ensure that all students feel comfortable, and have a discussion with students about what types of food are available or affordable in their own neighborhoods and communities.

- In Work Time A, provide choice in how students read the excerpt: some students may prefer to read independently and silently, while others (especially ELLs) may wish to read aloud in groups with peers and/or with support. Still others may wish to read silently for a few pages and then process with a group. This format of choice could potentially be built into the reading time within each lesson. ▲

- As in previous lessons, in Work Time A, present additional options for recording gist rather than just the sticky note, such as using a separate notebook, using a graphic organizer, using highlighters and annotating, or using a voice recorder. Give students options for expressing their understanding of gist (oral, written, drawing). Also, build in different options for expressing comprehension of the text (written reflection, voice recording, discussion with partners/groups). ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson contains supported in-class reading and further practice with analyzing an author’s purpose and point of view. Students add to the Author’s Purpose and Point of View: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* note-catcher and discuss their analyses in a collaborative exchange. The use of equity sticks supports ELLs in contributing to class discussion.

- ELLs may find it challenging to identify an author’s point of view and purpose. As in earlier lessons, help students to understand information and ideas, sentence by sentence, as needed. As time allows, encourage students to engage in home-language group discussions to build meaningful understanding of the text content.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.A.1, 8.I.A.3, and 8.II.A.1.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Purpose and Point of View: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* note-catchers to ensure they understand how to determine the author’s purpose, point of view, and conflicting viewpoints.

- Check student vocabulary logs for accountability in recording vocabulary.

- Check gist statements to ensure students are recording quick notes about what the text is mostly about.

- As students work in pairs to answer the selected response question in Closing and Assessment A, listen to discussions to determine how close students are to understanding how to answer questions related to RI.8.6, to determine any common issues that could be used as teaching points for the whole group.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will analyze paragraph structure in excerpts from *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* that students read in this lesson.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare:

- Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 8

- Ensure there is a copy of Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 8 at each student’s workspace.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

- Preread the text sections for today’s lesson, and review the Text Guide to ensure understanding of the material and content.

Technology and Multimedia

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous modules to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **1**, **Lesson** **8**.

- Using a preferred classroom routine, collect or review the answers to **Homework**: **Delineate** **an** **Argument**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma***, **Section** **5** from Lesson 7. Refer to the **Homework**: **Delineate** **an** **Argument**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma***, **Section** **5** (**answers** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 6 (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same process as with previous lessons for students to read section 6 of ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma***, using the **Text** **Guide**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma*** (**for** **teacher** **reference**). Instruct students to read the section independently, and support struggling students as needed. If students do not finish reading the section within the allotted reading time, distribute **Synopsis**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma***, **Section** **6** to each student to review the key details from the section. As time permits, have students identify the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary, reflect on their reading as they choose, and record the gist using the following resources as appropriate: **sticky** **notes** and **vocabulary** **logs**.

- Think-Triad-Share:

“What do you think about food production on local farms?” (Responses will vary, but may include: animals are treated well, or it takes too long to produce food.)

“What are you interested to learn more about now?” (Responses will vary, but may include: the benefits of feeding animals grass instead of corn, food production on other local farms.)

Work Time

B. Analyze Author’s Purpose and Point of View – RI.8.6 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze the author’s point of view and purpose in an excerpt from *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*.”

- Display **Author’s** **Purpose** **and** **Point** **of** **View**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma*** **note** - **catcher**, and instruct students to retrieve their copies.

- Have students turn to page 178 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* and reread the paragraph beginning with “Throwing and stacking fifty-pound bales . . . ” and ending with “ . . . kept them from roaming.”

- Using **equity** **sticks**, call on students, and ask the following questions from the note-catcher:

“What topic is the author addressing?” (working on a local farm)

“What is the author’s attitude toward this topic?” (Local sustainable farming is a lot of work.)

“What is the author’s reason for writing this?” (to point out how labor-intensive it is to farm well and sustainably)

“What words or ideas from the excerpt helped you determine that point of view?” (“the more weary you feel,” “left me bone tired”)

“How does the author’s point of view add to our understanding of this topic?” (helps us understand how difficult local farming is and why industrial farming is faster and easier)

- As students share, record their responses on the displayed Purpose and Point of View: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* note-catcher. Instruct students to follow along and record responses on their own note-catchers. Refer to **Author’s** **Purpose** **and** **Point** **of** **View**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma*** **note** - **catcher** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as needed.

- Have students turn to page 192. Reread paragraph 1, beginning with “Most industrial farmers . . . ” and ending with “ . . . what must be done.”

- Using equity sticks, call on students, and ask the following questions from the note-catcher:

“What topic is the author addressing?” (industrial farmers)

“What is the author’s attitude toward this topic?” (Industrial farmers are more concerned with money than conditions for animals.)

“What is the author’s reason for writing this?” (to demonstrate how local farms treat animals better than industrial farms)

“What words or ideas from the excerpt helped you determine that point of view?” (“don’t worry,” “forcing cows,” “even when it is unnatural”)

“How does the author’s point of view add to our understanding of this topic?” (helps us understand the difference between industrial farming and local sustainable farming)

- As students share, record their responses on the displayed Purpose and Point of View: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* note-catcher. Instruct students to follow along and record responses on their own note-catchers. Refer to Purpose and Point of View: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* note-catcher (example for teacher reference).

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- To build in further work with vocabulary in Work Time B, as students discuss point of view, invite them to consider other words and phrases that mean the same thing as *unnatural*, *the more weary you feel*, and *left me bone tired*. Students can share the synonyms they generate in small groups or as a class and discuss the subtle differences in meaning of each word or phrase. This will help to prepare students for further work with connotation and L.8.5c later in the module, in Unit 3.

For Heavier Support

- To build in further work with vocabulary in Work Time B, as students discuss point of view, invite them to consider other words and phrases that mean the same thing as *unnatural*, *the more weary you feel*, and *left me bone tired*. Display a list of synonyms, and ask students to consider the subtle differences in meaning of each one. This will help to prepare students for further work with connotation and L.8.5c later in the module, in Unit 3.

Closing and Assessment

A. Point of View: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 6 – RI.8.6 (5 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can explain how the author acknowledges conflicting viewpoints in the text.”

- Organize students into pairs.

- Display and distribute **Analyze** **Author’s** **Point** **of** **View**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma***, **Section** **6**. Read the question aloud as students read along silently, and explain that students will work together to answer the question focused on the author’s point of view in this excerpt from *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*. Tell students that they will be answering similar questions on the mid-unit assessment that will measure their development of these skills. Refer students to the **Strategies** **to** **Answer** **Selected** **Response** **Questions** **anchor** **chart** if needed.

- Circulate as students work to ensure they are on track, and answer any clarifying questions. Refer to **Analyze** **Author’s** **Point** **of** **View**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma***, **Section** **6** (**answers** **for** **teacher** **reference**) for the answer.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“Which response did you select in your handout?” (choice A: by comparing the treatment of animals on local farms and industrial farms)

- Have students add this conflicting viewpoint to their Purpose and Point of View: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* note-catcher. At the bottom section of the note-catcher, under “Conflicting Viewpoint,” note the section and page number (section 6, page 192), the topic the author addresses (industrial farmers), and the conflicting viewpoint (The goal of farming is production and profit.) in the space provided. Refer to Author’s Purpose and Point of View: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* note-catcher (example for teacher reference).

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent** **reading** **journal**.
