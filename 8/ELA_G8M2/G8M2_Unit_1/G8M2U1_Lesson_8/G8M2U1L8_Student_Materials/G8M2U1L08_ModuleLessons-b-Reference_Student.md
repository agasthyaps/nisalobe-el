- Salatin uses the natural instincts of animals on his farm.

- He lets chickens graze the pasture and clean up after herbivores instead of keeping them in coops to lay eggs quickly.

- Hens scratch at wood chips, which mix with rabbit urine and turn into compost.

- He allows turkeys to graze, eating bugs, trimming the grass, and fertilizing the grass.

- He feeds pigs corn so they can eat greedily. As they move around, they turn the compost over and over, which kills harmful bacteria and prepares it to spread across the fields.

- The author thinks local sustainability is less harmful to animals than industrial farming, which forces animals to produce unnaturally.
