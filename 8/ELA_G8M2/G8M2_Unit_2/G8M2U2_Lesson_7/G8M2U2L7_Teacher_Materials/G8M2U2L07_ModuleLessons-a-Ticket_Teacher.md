**Directions:** As you enter class, answer the following questions.

What is the Painted Essay® structure, and how can it support the writing process?

The Painted Essay® is a structure that uses color to help me understand the content of each part of the essay, and how the different parts connect.

What do you remember about using this structure in Module 1 when writing an essay on your modernized monster?

Responses will vary, but may include: I remember how color-coding each section helped me make sure I had a complete essay, etc.

How do you think this structure could support you in our current module as you write an informative essay?
