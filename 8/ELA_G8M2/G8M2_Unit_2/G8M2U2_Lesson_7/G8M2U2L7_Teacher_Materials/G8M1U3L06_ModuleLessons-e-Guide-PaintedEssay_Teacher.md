Paint an Essay Lesson Plan

(For Teacher Reference)

Introduction (red)

1.  Point to the first paragraph of the **Model Essay: “Peuchen,”** and remind students of the gist statement for this paragraph that they analyzed in Lesson 3.

2.  Read the sentences marked red on the **Painted Essay<sup>®</sup> Model: “Peuchen” (for teacher reference)**. Using a total participation technique, invite responses from the group:

“What is the purpose of the first sentences of this paragraph?” (It gives the reader information they need to know to make sense of the rest of the essay and grabs readers’ attention so they want to read more. For example, in the model, the introduction explains why folklore is often modernized in current day stories and provides background information about the peuchen.)

3.  Explain that you are going to color the first part of this paragraph red because it is an eye-catching color, like the information catching the reader’s attention. Refer to the Painted Essay<sup>®</sup> Model: “Peuchen” (for teacher reference).

4.  Focus students on the first box at the top of their Painted Essay<sup>®</sup> Template that says “Introduction.” Invite students to color this red, just as you did on the model. Emphasize that they are to stay in the lines and not to paint into the Focus Statement box.

5.  When most have finished, instruct students to put their pencils down.

Focus Statement (green)

6.  Repeat steps 1–5 with the next part of the Model Essay: “Peuchen”—the focus statement—marked green on the Painted Essay<sup>®</sup> Model: “Peuchen” (for teacher reference). Students will paint in green. Ensure students understand that the focus statement provides the main idea that you want the reader to take away. For example, in the model, the focus statement is that the author wrote a new scene to modernize the peuchen.

Points 1 and 2 (yellow and blue)

7.  Repeat steps 1–5 with the next part of the Model Essay: “Peuchen,” points 1 and 2, marked yellow and blue on the Painted Essay<sup>®</sup> Model: “Peuchen” (for teacher reference). Students will paint in yellow and blue. Ensure students understand that the two points break down the focus statement into two parts, which will be explained in the writing to support the focus statement. For example, in the model, the two points are that characteristics of the peuchen were left the same to make it recognizable, but it was also modernized to develop a theme.

8.  Briefly check all student work before moving on to the next step.

Proof Paragraph 1 (yellow)

9.  Repeat steps 1–5 with the next part of the Model Essay: “Peuchen”—Proof Paragraph 1—marked yellow on the Painted Essay<sup>®</sup> Model: “Peuchen” (for teacher reference). Students will paint in yellow. Ensure students understand that the purpose of this paragraph is to give evidence and reasons to prove point 1. This can look lots of different ways depending on what the essay is about. It needs to be specific and supports the main point. For example, in the model, this paragraph uses examples of how characteristics of the peuchen from folklore were maintained to make the peuchen recognizable.

10. Briefly check all student work before moving on to the next step.

Transition (yellow and blue)

11. Repeat steps 1–5 with the next part of the Model Essay: “Peuchen”—transition—marked yellow and blue on the Painted Essay<sup>®</sup> Model: “Peuchen” (for teacher reference). Students will paint in both yellow and blue—their designs can be however they’d like, as long as both colors are identifiable. For example, students could paint blue and yellow stripes or blue and yellow polka dots. Ensure students understand that the purpose of this sentence is to provide a transition between the ideas in Proof Paragraph 1 and the ideas in Proof Paragraph 2. For example, in the model, this sentence links Proof Paragraph 1, which was about how the author kept some aspects of the peuchen the same, to Proof Paragraph 2, which gives evidence of how the authors modernized the peuchen and changed aspects of its character to convey a theme.

12. Briefly check all student work before moving on to the next step.

Proof Paragraph 2 (blue)

13. Repeat steps 1–5 with the next part of the Model Essay: “Peuchen”—Proof Paragraph 2—marked blue on the Painted Essay<sup>®</sup> Model: “Peuchen” (for teacher reference). Students will paint in blue. Ensure students understand that the purpose of this paragraph is to give evidence and reasons to prove point 2. For example, in the model, this paragraph provides evidence of how the author modernized and changed elements of the peuchen story to convey a theme.

14. Briefly check all student work before moving on to the next step.

Conclusion (green, yellow, and blue)

15. Point to the final paragraph of the Model Essay: “Peuchen” and remind students of the gist statement for this paragraph.

16. Read the final paragraph, sentences marked green, yellow, and blue, on the Painted Essay<sup>®</sup> Model: “Peuchen” (for teacher reference). Using a total participation technique, invite responses from the group:

“What is the purpose of this final paragraph?” (The purpose is to wrap up the piece by restating the focus and adding some of your own thinking about why it is important. For example, in the model, this paragraph restates the focus statement and gives possible reasons for why an author might modernize a legend of myth.)

17. Explain that you are going to color the first part of this paragraph in green, yellow, and blue because it is a mix of the focus statement, point 1, and point 2. Refer to the Painted Essay<sup>®</sup> Model: “Peuchen” (for teacher reference).

18. Invite students to mix their yellow and blue pencils to make a shade of green. Explain that although the shade of green might be different from the color used for the focus statement, this shows that when they run the ideas in the yellow paragraph and the ideas in the blue paragraph through their own mind they come together to make something new—their own thinking on the topic, but still connected back to the focus statement. Refer back to the model!

19. Invite students to use the green they made to paint the final box on their template.

20. Review the structure of the model using the colors.
