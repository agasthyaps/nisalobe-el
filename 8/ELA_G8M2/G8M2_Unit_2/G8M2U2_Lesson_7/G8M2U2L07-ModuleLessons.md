Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.8.2 – Opening A: Students use the Painted Essay® structure to analyze a model informative essay and add to their understanding of the criteria of an effective informative essay.

- RI.8.1 – Work Time B: Students cite textual evidence as they analyze the structure of the model essay.

- W.8.4 – Work Time B: Students analyze the organization and development of a model essay, reflecting on how each paragraph relates to the author’s purpose.

- W.8.2 – Closing and Assessment A: Students use a model informative essay and the Informative Writing: “GMOs” checklist to generate specific criteria for their own essays.

- The Painted Essay® (Diana Leddy, Vermont Writing Collaborative) guides students to code each section of their essay a different color to understand each part, the content of each part, and how the different parts connect.

- The Informative Writing: “GMOs” checklist used in Closing and Assessment A is a consistent resource in all grades. Consider the amount of detail needed in modeling this for students.

- Students focus on working to become effective learners, persevering as they read and analyze a new text, and collaborating as they read and analyze the model essay with a partner.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Invite students to compare and contrast elements of the two model essays provided. Students can discuss in small groups or as a class.

- As students have preread Model Essay: “GMOs” for homework in the previous lesson, introduce and analyze the model with less scaffolding, as appropriate for students’ needs.

- Encourage students to find examples of gerunds and infinitives in the model essays. Students will be assessed on L.8.1a in Module 3, but they are introduced to these forms in Language Dives and Mini Language Dives in this unit. Students can explore the function of each verbal and discuss how they determined this information to build a deeper understanding of the interaction between structure and meaning.

- In later grades, students write informative texts to examine a topic and convey <u>complex</u> ideas, concepts, and information clearly through the effective selection, organization, and analysis of content. Students may examine the model essays and look for ways to add more complexity to the ideas expressed or deeper analysis of the content presented.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Students have worked with the Painted Essay® structure in Module 1. In this lesson, they use the same structure and examine how it applies to this essay prompt, looking closely at how the author uses evidence effectively to analyze the ways GMOs increase or decrease our access to healthy food.

- In this lesson, students examine one of the two model essays in detail. Both models are similar in structure but show two variations of what students’ writing may look like, depending on their independent research topic. The main model they analyze is about GMOs, which students are familiar with from their work in previous lessons analyzing and tracking the ways this research topic impacts access to healthy food. This model presents students with an informative essay structure in which the two main Proof Paragraphs support two contrasting points. Proof Paragraph 1 highlights one way GMOs <u>increase</u> access to healthy food, and Proof Paragraph 2 describes one way GMOs <u>decrease</u> access to healthy food. The second model, which students will examine in the next lesson, is about CSAs (Community Supported Agriculture) and also provides an example for students of an informative essay. In this model, the two main Proof Paragraphs support two complementary points. <u>Both</u> paragraphs explain ways that CSAs increase access to healthy food. Although students will primarily analyze the GMO model, it will be important for students to see both of these models. Depending on the nature of their research topics, some students will need to write essays in which both Proof Paragraphs focus on the complementary points, either explaining two ways the factor they researched increases access to healthy food or two ways it decreases access to healthy food. They will gain more experience with the second model essay in the next lesson.

Support All Students

- For those students who may be overwhelmed with or struggle to comprehend too much print on a page, offer a copy of the model essay with one paragraph per page.

- Some students may require additional support reading for gist in pairs. Strategically group pairs, and group students who may need additional support into one group.

- The density of the text may be especially difficult for ELLs. Encourage students to apply strategies for determining the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary and to think about the gist of each paragraph as they read. ▲

- Provide choice in how to carry out the reading portion of the lesson: some students may prefer to read independently and silently, while others (especially ELLs) may wish to read aloud in groups. Still others may wish to read silently for a few pages and then process with a group. ▲

- Incorporate a mix of processing opportunities after reading, including writing reflections and small group and whole-class discussion. ▲

- Pair students (especially ELLs) thoughtfully for Pair-Share to build supportive and safe exchange. Vary these partners throughout the unit to expose students to diverse perspectives one-on-one. ▲

- Provide students with The Painted Essay® template (one per student; from Module 1), as needed, as an additional support in Work Time B when students are analyzing the model essay. ▲

- In this lesson, students use the Write-Pair-Share protocol, which is a variation of the Think-Pair-Share protocol used since Module 1. In this protocol, students jot down their responses to questions posed, then share their answers with a peer as a way to process information; engage with the topic; and promote productive, equitable conversations. Students also use the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol.

- Throughout this lesson, students refer to and examine the Model Essay: “GMOs” prior to planning aspects of their own independent research essay. Although not built in as frequently for instruction, students will also have access to the second model essay, Model Essay: “CSAs.” Use the Model Essay: “CSAs” in large and small group instruction or in additional ways to support students who will need a closer view of this essay as determined by their independent research topic.

- To support ELLs, this lesson uses the Painted Essay® format to help students understand an informative essay’s overall structure, the purpose of each part of the essay, and how the different parts connect. Additionally, the use of an Informative Writing checklist helps students to identify important elements of the essay, preparing them to write their own informative essays in upcoming lessons.

- ELLs may find it challenging to identify all of the criteria on the Informative Writing checklist. Celebrate students’ successes in recognizing items on the checklist, and encourage collaboration to ensure that students have support in identifying how the model essay meets the criteria. Reassure students that they will be working closely with the model over the next few lessons and that they will have ample time to become more familiar with how each of the criteria is met before they begin writing their own essays.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.A.1, 8.I.A.3, 8.I.A.4, 8.I.B.5, 8.I.B.6, and 8.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- As students analyze the model essay with partners in Work Time A, circulate and listen for misconceptions. Once complete, review students’ gist statements to ensure they are on the right track.

- Throughout Work Time B, frequently review students’ work to ensure they are color-coding accurately. Use common issues as whole group teaching points.

Down the Road

- In Lessons 8 and 9, students will refer back to and analyze parts of the model essays as they plan their own informative essays on their selected case studies. They will use their plan to draft and revise their essays in Lessons 10 and 11. Afterward, students will use the Desktop Teaching Activity to present the research findings they have written about.

- In the next lesson, students will complete a Language Dive on focus statements and will plan the introductions for their essays.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.8.2 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **2**, **Lesson** **7**.

- Once all students are ready, invite them to use their answers on the Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 7 and share a suggested definition of the Painted Essay®.

- Turn and Talk:

“What is the Painted Essay® structure, and how can it support the writing process?” (The Painted Essay® is a structure that uses color to help us understand the content of each part of the essay and how the different parts connect.)

- Distribute and display a **Painted** **Essay** ® **template**, and direct students to gather this resource from Module 1. Have students Turn and Talk to a predesignated partner whom they will consult for this portion of the lesson:

“Describe how this template is organized, and explain the name and purpose of each part of the template.” (Students share the purpose of each section. Refer to Paint an Essay lesson plan \[for teacher reference\] as needed.)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read for Gist: Model Essay: “GMOs” (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can find the gist of a model essay.”

- Introduce students to their essay prompt: How does “x” influence our access to healthy food? Explain that “x” represents different topics that influence access to healthy foods that they will be researching. Tell students that in this model essay, we will examine GMOs, so the specific question we will be examining in the model essay is: “How do GMOs influence our access to healthy food?”

- Explain that when students later write their own essays, they will answer this question with information from their case study in mind, and that is why the “x” is used—it represents the variety of research topics students have researched. Tell students that prior to them writing this essay, we will first analyze a model essay on GMOs. Tell them that the topic of model essay, GMOs, is one they have learned a lot about through their research and reading in *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*. Remind students that they discovered that in some ways GMOs increase access to healthy food, while in other ways questions about their harm remain.

- Distribute and display the **Model** **Essay**: “ **GMOs**.”

- Remind students of the purpose of using a model essay, and ask them to Turn and Talk about the ways analyzing a model essay helps writers. (Analyzing a model supports students as they deepen their understanding of different types of writing and as they develop and apply new writing skills.)

- Read the model aloud as students follow along, reading silently.

- Using a total participation technique, invite responses from the group:

“What is this model about?” (GMOs and the ways in which they increase and/or decrease our access to healthy foods.)

- Point out that the writer uses evidence to support his points, which helps the reader better understand each point. Emphasize that the essays they will write, like the model, will be grounded in evidence from research sources.

- Refocus students on the Model Essay: “GMOs.” Reread aloud the first paragraph, inviting students to follow along, reading silently.

- Invite students to Write-Pair-Share, capturing their answers on the margins of their model essay:

“What is the gist of the introduction paragraph?” (Many factors influence Americans’ access to healthy food. GMOs are made by changing the genes of an organism and can be used to help people access healthy food, yet people have questions about their safety.)

- Cold Call on students to share out what they wrote and discussed in their pairs. As students share, capture their response next to the first paragraph on the displayed model. Invite students to work in their predesignated pairs to annotate each of the remaining paragraphs for gist.

- After 7 minutes, refocus the whole group, and use total participation techniques to select students to share the gist of each paragraph with the whole group. Capture responses on the displayed model, and clarify any misconceptions. Responses will vary, but should be similar to the following:

- Proof Paragraph 1 (GMOs allow more access to healthy food by supporting increased production of food, such as corn, and limiting pesticide use, which is better for the environment.)

- Proof Paragraph 2 (Although GMOs provide increased access to healthy food, there are questions about their safety. They have not been in use long enough for adequate testing.)

- Conclusion (Overall, there are many benefits to using GMOs, but questions and potential harms to health remain and should be studied and monitored more closely.)

- Remind students that the topic of the Model Essay: “GMOs” is a familiar one. Ask students to Write-Pair-Share in response to the following prompt, capturing their notes at the bottom of the model essay:

“In your own words, describe to your partner what this essay is about.” (Students should explain that this essay describes the ways in which GMOs increase access to healthy food by providing dependable access to food, and the ways in which GMOs decrease access to healthy food because there are questions that arise about their safety.)

- Explain to students that when writing an essay, one of the things a writer pays attention to is the tone. While discussing the topic of GMOs, the writer is careful to use precise evidence that is explained clearly, without generalizing too much or presenting it too dramatically. In this essay, the writer avoids blanket statements and overreach. This makes the essay more accurate and also projects a cautious tone. One effective strategy the writer uses for this is including words like *seems*, *may*, *can*, and *it* *is* *possible*. Refer students to Proof Paragraph 2 of the Model Essay: “GMOs,” and direct them to underline any words that suggest a cautious tone. Use the **Model** **Essay**: “ **GMOs** ” (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as needed, and call on students to share out the terms they underline.

- Call on a student to read aloud the last sentence of Proof Paragraph 2. Ask students:

“What words are used that suggest a cautious tone?” (*it is possible, may* \[multiple times\])

- Explain to students that the author could have used different language to be more dramatic in the presentation of the information. For instance, the writer could have said something like, “GMOs are terrible for consumers and should be avoided at all costs!” Prompt students to Think-Pair-Share:

“Why didn’t the writer compose the sentence this way?” (Being too dramatic, or overstating, can be inaccurate. Writers need to carefully report information, use evidence, and explain it in a clear way, avoiding drama or misrepresentation. Good writing means careful thinking and using evidence in an honest, accurate way.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- Before Work Time A, distribute the model essay cut into paragraphs or sentences. Challenge students to organize the parts of the essay into a logical order. This will draw students’ attention to the structure of the essay and activate thinking before students read the essay as a complete piece of writing.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time A, before students have read the model essay, distribute the Informative Writing checklist, and have students annotate their copies of the model essay as they notice criteria. This will help students during Closing and Assessment A, when they complete the Informative Writing checklist, and it will draw students’ attention to important elements and characteristics of the essay while they read, reinforcing the purpose that each one serves.

Work Time

B. Analyze a Model Essay – W.8.4 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze a model to generate criteria of an effective informative essay on my selected research case study.”

- Introduce the essay prompt for students’ informative research essay:

- “How do(es) \[the topic of your research case study\] influence access to healthy food?”

- Explain that students will draft their own informative essay in Lessons 10 and 11. Remind students that they will write about how the topic of their own selected research case study increases or decreases access to healthy food. Their essay will be modeled after this essay that analyzes the ways in which GMOs increase and decrease access to healthy food, or will be modeled after the CSA model essay, which shows two increases in access to healthy food, and which they will examine in the next lesson.

- Redirect students’ attention to the Model Essay: “GMOs.” Explain to students that they will look at this model again, more closely, to consider how the content and structure can guide the work they will do on their own informative essays. In particular, students will look closely at the focus statement and Proof Paragraphs of the model essay to see how the author conveys how GMOs increase and decrease access to healthy food.

- Distribute **colored** **pencils**, and use questions similar to those below to guide students in color-coding their Model Essay: “GMOs.” Review each part of the essay, encouraging students to refer to the Painted Essay® template as they work. Refer to the Paint an Essay lesson plan for further detail, as needed. Prompt students to reread the introduction paragraph, and then invite students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What context is provided in this essay? Where is the context given?” (Students should recognize that the author gives context about the challenges to accessing healthy food—location, cost, etc., and basic information about GMOs, such as how they are created and how scientists might use them to create healthy food like frost-resistant strawberries.)

“Why is it helpful to include this context?” (The context helps the reader, who may be unfamiliar with the topic, build understanding that is necessary to follow the rest of the argument as it unfolds in the essay.)

“What is the focus statement?” (Students should recognize that “GMOs influence our access to healthy food. In many ways, GMOs seem to improve access to healthy foods. In other ways, the safety and benefit of GMOs are still being questioned.” is the focus statement.)

- Direct students to reread the Proof Paragraphs of the Model Essay: “GMOs,” inviting partners to read them aloud together. After rereading these paragraphs, invite students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What increases in access to healthy food are conveyed in this essay?” (increase in amount of corn available for humans and animals to consume, fewer trans fats in certain oils, less pesticide application required on crops)

“Where does the writer discuss these increases?” (Proof Paragraph 1)

“What decreases in access to healthy food are conveyed in this essay?” (unknown long-term impact on health because of lack of long-term studies, increase in prevalence of non-Hodgkins lymphoma owing to a GMO called Enlist Duo, and increase in herbicide use on crops)

“Where did the writer discuss these decreases?” (Proof Paragraph 2)

“How does the author inform the reader about the ways GMOs increase and/or decrease access to healthy food?” (The author uses relevant evidence from the text and related articles to support the focus. The author also clarifies ideas with elaboration.)

- Reread the conclusion aloud, directing students to read along silently in their heads. Invite students to Think-Pair-Share:

“How does the author conclude the essay?” (by restating the focus and reflecting on the significant need for more studies on the impact of GMOs)

- Invite students to share with the whole group, and track annotations and notes on the projected copy of the model. Field any questions, and correct any misconceptions. Refer to Model Essay: “GMOs” (example for teacher reference), as needed.

- Project the following questions, and provide quiet think time for students:

- What is the model essay about?

- What is the purpose?

- Who is the audience?

- How does it connect to the prompt in our upcoming informative research essays?

- Invite students to choose two questions from the list and then Turn and Talk with a partner about the responses.

- Inform students that, owing to the nature of their particular research case study, their essay may look like this GMO model or a second, slightly different model, which they will read for homework and will examine in more detail in the next lesson.

- Take time to field any questions that arise as students determine the best fit for the points of their essays, and address any misconceptions with the group.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Closing and Assessment

A. Review Criteria for Informative Essay – W.8.2 (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze a model essay to determine criteria for an informative essay on my selected research case study.”

- Distribute and display the **Informative** **Writing**: “ **GMOs** ” **checklist**. Model how to complete the first row of the Informative Writing: “GMOs” checklist using examples from the Model Essay: “GMOs” to determine what each of the general criteria on the checklist may look like in their own informative essays about access to healthy food. See **Informative** **Writing**: “ **GMOs** ” **checklist** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

“Where do you see evidence of W.8.2a: ‘I provide a clear focus and maintain the focus consistently throughout the piece.’?” (Responses will vary, but should include that the author provides a clearly stated focus statement that mentions two points, one regarding a way his/her research case study increases access to healthy food, and one regarding a way his/her research case study decreases access to healthy food. Each Proof Paragraph is based off of one of these main points. Remind students that depending on their topic, the points they write may be on two increases or two decreases.)

- Invite students to record a response on row two of their Informative Writing checklist: “GMOs.” Invite students to work in pairs to complete the remainder of the Informative Writing: “GMOs” checklist by analyzing the characteristics of the Model Essay: “GMOs.” Circulate and support students as needed, prompting students to notice specific words and phrases from the text. See Informative Writing: “GMOs” checklist (example for teacher reference) for support.

- Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face:

“How might a checklist like this support an author in writing clearly about the increases and decreases in access to healthy food in the Model Essay: ‘GMOs’?” (Responses will vary, but may include: using the Informative Writing: “GMOs” checklist could help the author to remember to provide a clear focus supported with evidence.)

“How will using this model essay and the Informative Writing: ‘GMOs’ checklist support the upcoming writing tasks?” (Responses will vary.)

“Review the Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart, and give examples of ways in which you showed perseverance or collaboration in today’s partner work.” (Responses will vary.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Preread a Model Essay for Gist

- Students complete **Homework**: **Preread** **for** **Gist**: “ **CSAs** ” to answer selected and constructed response questions about Model Essay: “CSAs.”

B. Independent Research Reading
