Directions for Peer Critique

1.  Partner A and B read each other’s essays, circling transition words and places where they believe transition words should be included. Partners also identify examples where spelling needs to be corrected.

2.  Each partner generates suggestions for transition words and spelling changes in the margins of their partner’s essay.

3.  Partner A identifies one star (one thing your partner did well) and records it on a sticky note.

4.  Example: “I noticed you spelled these difficult words correctly and included a transition word in your focus statement.”

5.  Partner A identifies one step (one thing your partner could improve) and records it on a different-colored sticky note.

6.  Example: “Could you include a transition word in the first sentence of the second proof paragraph to make the flow of your ideas clearer?”

7.  Switch roles and repeat steps 1–4.

8.  Explain your feedback. Partner A first, then partner B.

9.  Ask your partner clarifying questions if you don’t understand.
