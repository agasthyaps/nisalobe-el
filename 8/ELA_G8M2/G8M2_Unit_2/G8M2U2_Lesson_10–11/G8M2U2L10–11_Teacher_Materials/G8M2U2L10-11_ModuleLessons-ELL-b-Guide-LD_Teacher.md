5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

W.8.2, L.8.1c

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

**Do we have** enough money to buy healthy food? (from paragraph 1 of Model Essay: “GMOs”)

**Lessons 10–11 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive before students draft their informative essays in Work Time B.  
(Note: Alternatively, this mini may be integrated into Lessons 8 or 9 after students have analyzed the model essay.)

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target (**I can draft an informative essay using the Painted Essay<sup>®</sup> Structure**) and W.8.2 by providing an example of a sentence that helps to introduce a topic within the introduction of a model informative essay. This sentence also helps students to address L.8.1c, as it contains a verb expressed in the interrogative mood.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses a verb expressed in the interrogative mood with the purpose of capturing a reader’s attention while introducing an essay topic.

- Transfer: question word + subject + predicate to pose questions within the introduction of an informative essay and during the End of Unit 2 Assessment.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **<u>Do we have</u> enough money to buy healthy food?**

- Ask:

“What is this sentence about?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **Do we have**

- Ask:

“What do you notice about this chunk?” (Responses will vary, but help students to notice that this is the start of a question.)

“What in this chunk tells us this is the start of a question?” (The structure do + subject + verb is a familiar pattern that we see at the beginning of sentences that pose a question.)

“What other words do you use at the beginning of questions?” (Responses will vary but should include words like what, who, when, where, how, can, will, would, should, have, and forms of the verb to be.)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **<u>Do we have</u> enough money to buy healthy food?**

- Ask:

“Why do you think the writer chose to include a question in the introduction of the essay?” (to capture the reader’s attention and to introduce the topic by outlining a concern that consumers have when considering how to eat healthy)

“How is this question relevant to the topic of genetically modified foods?” (It’s broadly related because it is about one of the factors consumers consider when deciding what food to eat. The writer includes this question and others in the introduction before narrowing down the topic in the focus statement.)

“In what mood is the verb written? Why did the author use this mood? How does this mood differ from the indicative and imperative moods?” (The verb in this sentence is written in the interrogative mood. We use the interrogative mood to ask a question. Other moods in English are used to state facts or opinions, to make a command, or to express a wish.)

- Display the sentence rewritten using the indicative and imperative moods:

> Indicative: **We have enough money to buy healthy food.**
>
> Imperative: **Have enough money to buy healthy food!**

- Invite students to compare the three sentences.

- Ask:

“What differences do you notice among these sentences that use the indicative, interrogative, and imperative moods?” (The subject is at the beginning of the sentence that has a verb expressed in the indicative mood, and it’s been removed from the sentence with a verb in the imperative mood; the helping verb to only appears in the sentence that uses the imperative mood; the punctuation used at the end of each sentence is different.)

“How can you use each of the verb moods in your own speaking and writing?” (Responses will vary.)

- Ask:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does this Mini Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target: I can draft an informative essay using the Painted Essay<sup>®</sup> Structure”?a (Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

> **<u>\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_</u>?**
>
> question word + subject + predicate

- Say:

“Use this frame to draft a sentence with the verb expressed in the interrogative mood for the introduction of your essay.”

> Sample response:
>
> **<u>Are we eating chemicals in our food</u>?**
>
> question word + subject + predicate
