**Prompt:** How do CSAs influence our access to healthy food?

Access to healthy food is a basic human need, and it can be complicated. In America today, many factors influence our access to healthy food. Do we have enough money to buy healthy food? Is healthy food available where we live? Can we find food that is grown in good soil? Can we find food that is free of chemicals that might cause harm? Can our soil and water contribute to growing healthy food? Can we find healthy food from healthy animals? All of these are factors we consider when we think about access to healthy food. Today, one way of getting food is through a CSA. The term **CSA** stands for “community supported agriculture.” CSAs work by subscription. At the beginning of the growing season, people buy shares in a local farm. In exchange, they get fruits and vegetables (and sometimes meat or dairy) over the course of the growing season. This is usually around twenty weeks, from June through October (Cleveland Clinic, 2016). One estimate from Penn State says that between 30,000 and 50,000 people in the United States belong to a CSA (Penn State Extension, 2014). CSAs have an influence on our access to healthy food. They have many advantages. Two of the most important are the high quality of the food itself, and the positive impact on the use of fossil fuels.

There is general agreement that CSAs can produce high-quality food. Much of this is because it is locally grown, and the consumers eat it shortly after it has been harvested. Food that comes from far away is older. It has traveled many miles, and has probably sat in a warehouse, before you buy it (Grobinger, University of Vermont, 2010). According to dietician Beth Bluestone from the Cleveland Clinic, “Once produce is harvested, its optimal nutritional value decreases, specifically in vitamins A, B, C and E” (Cleveland Clinic, 2016). Food from a local CSA, however, is ready to eat shortly after harvest. This means that the food from a CSA is very fresh and has higher nutrient levels. Clearly, the food that people get from a CSA is likely to be healthier than even the food from a supermarket, because it has been so recently picked. Besides the benefit of being so fresh, food from a CSA gives the consumer many choices (Cleveland Clinic, 2016). Depending on the time in the growing season, the weekly CSA box contains many different types of fruits and vegetables. In early summer, the customer may get berries, lettuce, and asparagus. Later, foods could include potatoes, watermelon, and apples. The local CSA also gives out information and recipes about how to use this variety of fresh food (Cleveland Clinic, 2016). All of this makes it easier for people to eat healthy food, so their access to healthy food has increased.

In addition to increasing access to healthy food through freshness and variety, CSAs increase access to healthy food by having a positive impact on the use of fossil fuels. In *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Michael Pollan points out that food generally has to travel around 1,500 miles to get from the farmer to the consumer (Pollan, 158). That means a lot of fossil fuel is burned just moving food. Compared to that, CSA crops are local and so travel only a very short distance to get to the consumer. As Utah State University Extension notes, “Reducing the distance food travels (food miles) cuts down on associated fossil fuel consumption, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions” (Utah State University Extension, 2012). This reduction in fossil fuel use matters a lot for the environment. The climate of the planet is changing; the average temperature has gone up by 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit since 1800. Burning fossil fuels is the major cause of this increase (Union of Concerned Scientists, 2015). While 1.5 degrees may not seem like a lot, scientists agree that it is making a huge difference. Ultimately, how healthy the planet is will have a lot to do with people’s access to healthy food. So, cutting down on fossil fuel use by buying food from CSAs will improve access to healthy food.

Overall, most indications are that CSAs improve people’s access to healthy food. Even though 50,000 people using them does not seem like a lot, CSAs play an important part for those users in having reliable access to healthy food. If we as a society could support the creation of more CSAs, we would be serving our people and our planet well, both now and in the future.
