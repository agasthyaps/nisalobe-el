Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.8.2f – Opening A: Students analyze how an author provided a concluding section that follows from and supports the information or explanation presented.

- W.8.2f – Work Time A: Students plan a conclusion that follows from and supports the information or explanation presented.

- W.8.4 – Work Time A: Students examine the conclusion of a model essay, analyzing how the development, organization, and style are appropriate for the task and purpose.

- W.8.5 – Work Time A: With some guidance and support, students develop and strengthen the plan of their conclusions.

- W.8.2 – Work Time B: Students draft the informative essay they planned in Lessons 8 and 9 of Module 2, Unit 2. Students examine their independent research topic plan and convey their ideas and information through the selection, organization, and analysis of relevant content.

- W.8.4 – Work Time B: As students draft their informative essay, they practice producing clear and coherent writing that is appropriate for the task.

- W.8.6 – Work Time B: Students use technology to draft their essays.

- W.8.2 – Closing and Assessment A: In their peer critique, students receive feedback about their use of appropriate and varied transitions, their use of precise and domain-specific language, and their accuracy with spelling in their independent research topic.

- W.8.5 – Closing and Assessment A: With some guidance and support from peers, students receive and synthesize peer feedback to strengthen their writing.

- SL.8.4 – Closing and Assessment A: As students engage collaboratively to present their informative essay plans and critique one another’s work, they focus on using appropriate eye contact, adequate volume, and clear pronunciation.

- In this lesson, students analyze and plan their conclusions. They then draft their informative essay, present their research findings, and receive feedback in a peer critique on their use of transitions, domain-specific vocabulary, and correct spelling.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners, practicing perseverance as they draft their informative essays. Students also show respect as they work to become ethical people as they analyze a peer’s informative essay and critique the work.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Gather a number of new texts with effective conclusions. Invite students to analyze these conclusions written by professionals to gather more criteria for an effective conclusion.

- If students are identifying the parts of a conclusion and planning them with ease, draw their attention to specific sentences within the paragraphs, and ask what the roles of the sentences are and what the effect of removing those sentences would be, as is shown in Work Time A.

- Have students write an additional essay independently to continue to practice the skills that have been scaffolded in this unit.

- Provide opportunities for students to read more than one of their peers’ essays. Encourage students to read one essay from each of the research topics to deepen understanding of content and to build broader understanding of successful essays that meet the informative writing criteria.

- An optional Mini Language Dive, intended for use before students draft their essays in Work Time A, is available in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students analyzed the structure of the model essay using the Painted Essay® template, looking at the introduction and the Proof Paragraphs of a model essay. This lesson continues that work, narrowing in on the conclusion of the essay. In this lesson, students apply their understanding of the Painted Essay® structure and show their understanding of the case they studied as they draft their essay and apply revisions.

Support All Students

- Revisit the model essay and/or read it aloud to model the components of a Painted Essay® before students begin drafting. Students may also visually display their drafts in painted form. ▲

- Students may have varying levels of familiarity and comfortability with planning for the conclusion. Be aware of those who may struggle or may need additional support with skill or confidence levels. ▲

- Encourage students who might be struggling with planning their conclusion to first work on restating the focus statement and then think about the reflection. Providing time for students to orally rehearse their ideas with a partner prior to planning their conclusion, and reviewing the important aspects of their evidence, will assist students as they plan their reflection statement. ▲

- Have students verbally discuss their paragraphs before drafting their essays. ▲

- To set themselves up for success, students need to rely on the detailed planning they have done across the unit and all they have learned by practicing during their planning and analysis of the model essay. Before students begin drafting their essays, activate prior knowledge by reviewing important aspects of an informative essay together. ▲

- Peer critique requires strong empathy and growth mindset. For Closing and Assessment A, preselect student partnerships to strategically group students who can be supportive of one another both in skills and in confidence and kindness, and provide supportive partners for students who might struggle with the task. Model a kind and constructive critique, or have a pair of students model this. Continually ground students in the ideas of working to become ethical people. ▲

- Some students, especially ELLs, may struggle to recognize areas for improvement in their peers’ essays and may have difficulty articulating feedback. Pair students strategically to ensure ELLs are well supported during the peer critique portion of the lesson. ▲

- Essays can be drafted and edited using an online tool such as http://eled.org/0158. Peer-sharing and critique can also be done this way using track changes.

- To support ELLs, these lessons incorporate repeated routines, embedded Think-Pair-Shares, and continued scaffolding with the writing process as students move into drafting their informative essays. Students translate the planning they have done into an essay and then spend time reviewing one another’s work during a peer critique.

- ELLs may find it challenging to articulate feedback for their partners during the peer critique. Likewise, some students may find it difficult to pinpoint areas for improvement in their partner’s writing. Remind students that in addition to receiving useful feedback, one benefit of participating in a peer critique is the opportunity to see examples of effective writing and to learn from peers while analyzing their writing.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.A.1, 8.I.A.3, and 8.I.A.4.

Assessment Guidance

- Although Work Time B is an informal assessment of informative writing skills, use the Grade 8 Writing Process checklist to assess students’ writing abilities in Work Time B (see the Tools page: http://eled.org/tools), to give targeted feedback to students for their improvement on future formal informative writing assessments focusing particularly on W.8.5.

Down the Road

- In this lesson, students complete their informative essays and give peer feedback. In the following lesson, students will begin to prepare for the Desktop Teaching protocol that will be used in Lesson 14 when they present their research findings in their End of Unit 2 Assessment.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.8.2f (10 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **1**, **Lessons** **10** – **11**.

- Explain to students that today they will work on creating strong conclusions. Prompt students to share their answers to the Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lessons 10–11. Use **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **2**, **Lessons** **10** – **11** (**answers** **for** **teacher** **reference**) to clarify any questions or misconceptions.

- Invite students to reflect on previous writing experiences, and guide them to Turn and Talk:

“What are the elements of an effective conclusion?” (Responses will vary, but may include: a restatement of the focus statement and a section that shares their further reflection on the topic.)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Analyze Model and Plan Conclusion – W.8.5 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can plan a conclusion of an informative essay that follows from and supports the information presented.”

- Direct students’ attention to the **Model** **Essay**: “ **GMOs**,” and invite students to form triads. Explain to students that they will first analyze the conclusion of the model essay, to help them plan the conclusion for their own informative essay.

- Distribute **Organize** **Model** **Essay**: “ **GMOs** ” **conclusion** **strips** and **scissors** to each group. Tell students that each group has been given sentence strips for the conclusion, and they will work together to organize all of the parts back together in a logical order in order to understand how the writer created this conclusion. Direct students to cut apart the strips, and assign one of the strips to each member of the triad, who will be responsible for identifying the role his or her strip plays and its order in the conclusion.

- Circulate to support students in reading and sorting the conclusion strips. Refer to **Organize** **Model** **Essay**: “ **GMOs** ” **conclusion** **strips** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as needed. Invite triads to identify how the author rephrased the focus statement from the introductory paragraph of the model, using different words, and reflected on the points he/she made throughout the essay. Triads should capture their reorganized conclusion on the bottom of the Organize Model Essay: “GMOs” conclusion strips handout and read their conclusion aloud.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What sentences did the author use to restate the focus of the piece?” (“Overall, there are indications that GMOs improve people’s access to healthy food. At the same time, many questions and potential harms to health remain.”)

- Read the remainder of the conclusion aloud to note how the author continues to reflect, and ask students to Turn and Talk:

“What sentence explains why we should still monitor the impact of GMOs?” (“It seems sensible to very closely study and monitor the effects of GMOs on human health, animal health, and soil and water.”)

“What sentence did the author use to show further reflection on the topic of GMOs?” (“Having reliable access to healthy food, both short and long term, is too important to leave to chance.”)

“Why are these sentences important?” (Responses will vary, but students should note that the reflection helps readers connect the focus statement and leaves the reader with something to think about.)

- Refocus the whole group. Invite students to choral read the conclusion together as a class, stopping after each sentence to explain its function in the paragraph.

- As applicable, display and invite students to review their copies of **Model** **Essay**: “ **CSAs**,” and analyze each part of the conclusion of that model essay, noting the similarities to the conclusion in the Model Essay: “GMOs.”

- Remind students that as they plan their conclusions, they should explain how their research topic increases access to healthy food, mention any decreases in access to healthy food as a result of the research topic, and add reflection on the importance of the topic.

- Tell students they are now ready to plan their conclusions. Invite students to complete the planning for their conclusion on their **Informative** **Writing** **Plan** **graphic** **organizer**.

- As they finish, recommend that students verbally rehearse the sentences they will use to restate the focus and reflect with a partner.

- Circulate to support students as they plan and to identify common issues to use as whole group teaching points.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Work Time

B. Independent Writing: Draft an Informative Essay – W.8.2 (50 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can draft an informative essay using the Painted Essay® structure.”

- Invite students to retrieve the following materials:

- **Independent** **Research**: **Case** **Study** **Research** **planner** **and** **note** - **catcher**

- **Informative** **Writing** **Plan** **graphic** **organizer**

- **Informative** **Writing** **checklist**

- **Painted** **Essay** ® **template**

- **Model** **Essay**: “ **GMOs** ”

- **Informative** **Writing**: **Independent** **Research** **Essay** **directions**

- **Researcher’s** **Toolbox**

- **Transition** **Words** **handout**

- Distribute **devices** for students to write essays, and tell students that they will use their plans to draft their essays.

- Display the Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer, and read the prompt aloud as students follow along silently:

- “How do(es) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ influence our access to healthy food?”

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“Point to, and describe, the part of your Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer where you explain an increase in access to healthy food. For those of you writing about two decreases in access to healthy food, point to your first decrease.” (Students should reference the increases of their specific case study, as outlined in Proof Paragraph 1.)

“Describe the decreases in access to healthy food related to the research case study you researched. For those of you writing about two increases in access to healthy food, point to your second increase.” (Students should describe the decreases of their specific case study, as outlined in Proof Paragraph 2.)

- Invite students to refer to their Informative Writing checklist, briefly rereading the criteria and then answering the question below.

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“Based on the feedback you have received while planning your essay in previous lessons, are there any specific criteria you should focus on from the checklist as you draft your essay?” (Responses will vary, but students should identify areas of growth they hope to concentrate on in their writing.)

- Answer clarifying questions about the task.

- Focus students on the **Work** **to** **Become** **Effective** **Learners** **anchor** **chart**, and review perseverance and what this looks and sounds like. Remind students that as they will be drafting their full essay today, they may need to practice perseverance.

- Ask students to Turn and Talk:

“What aspects of perseverance will you work on during your drafting today?” (Responses will vary, but may include: I will stick with my task and stay focused. I will ask clarifying questions when I need to. I will avoid distraction.)

- Remind students that they planned this essay in the previous lessons, and focus their attention on their Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer. Remind students to refer to the **domain** - **specific** **word** **wall** as needed.

- Invite students to begin drafting their essays.

- While students are drafting, circulate to monitor and document their essay-writing skills. Support students as needed.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

- Repeat, inviting students to self-assess how well they persevered in this lesson.

For Lighter Support

- Before Work Time B, invite students to participate in a Mini Language Dive with a sentence from the article in small groups to deepen their understanding of how the author of a model essay uses a question in the introduction to engage the reader and introduce the topic. The sentence also helps students to address L8.1c, as it contains a verb expressed in the interrogative mood.

- To extend work in the Mini Language Dive in Work Time B, ask additional questions during the Reconstruct portion of the Dive to help students deepen their understanding of the difference between infinitives and gerunds and how we use each of these verbals:

“Why do you think the phrase ‘enough money’ can be followed by an infinitive but not a gerund in this sentence?” (When a verbal follows a noun, it is usually an infinitive, not a gerund. In addition, we often use infinitives to talk about purpose. ‘To buy’ tells us how the money would be used.)

- During Work Time B, have students check in with a partner after drafting each paragraph. During these check-ins, students can read their paragraphs aloud and offer brief suggestions or ask each other clarifying questions. As an alternative or in addition to this process, build in pair check-ins prior to writing each paragraph where students can talk through the information on their planner before drafting each part of the essay.

For Heavier Support

- After Work Time B, if it is feasible to do so, host individual writing check-ins with ELLs to discuss their informative essays. During these meetings, work with students to identify their strengths as well as pinpoint areas of possible growth. Help students develop action plans for working toward their goals. Plan to meet with students again at the end of the module to track their progress and adjust goals as needed. This process supports a growth mindset for developing writers and facilitates opportunities for students to take charge of their own learning.

- To deepen students’ understanding of the interrogative mood and how questions are formed, invite ELLs to consider how questions are formed in their home languages. Students can share the similarities and differences they notice between the two languages in small groups or with the class. This will help to build awareness of English-language structures among both ELLs and students who use English as a home language, while also honoring and celebrating the diverse linguistic backgrounds of ELLs and their assets as multilingual learners.

Closing and Assessment

A. Peer Critique – SL.8.4 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can give kind, helpful, and specific feedback to my partner.”

- Display and again focus students on their Informative Writing checklist.

- Focus students on the criteria:

- W.8.2c: I use a variety of appropriate transitions to show how ideas and information connect.

- W.8.2d: I use precise language and domain-specific vocabulary.

- L.8.2: My spelling, capitalization, and punctuation are correct.

- Invite students to mark or highlight these criteria, since they will be the focus of the critique.

- Turn and Talk:

“What do each of these criteria mean, in your own words?”

- Move students into pairs, and invite them to label themselves A and B.

- Distribute **sticky** **notes**.

- Focus students on the Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart, specifically on *I* *collaborate*. Remind students that because they will be critiquing their partner’s essay draft, they will need to use their listening and speaking skills to collaborate.

- Tell students they will use their peer critique to provide their partner with kind, specific, and helpful feedback.

- Focus students on the **Work** **to** **Become** **Ethical** **People** **anchor** **chart**, and remind them specifically of respect and compassion. Remind students that the purpose of peer feedback is to help the other student improve his or her work, so when we provide feedback, we have to be careful to ensure we are respectful and compassionate.

- Display the **Directions** **for** **Peer** **Critique**, and read the directions aloud.

- Display the **Peer** **Critique** **Protocol** **anchor** **chart**, and ask for volunteers to share what each criterion means, looks like, and sounds like. Record responses on the anchor chart.

- Invite students to provide feedback to their partner based on the Informative Writing checklist.

- Circulate to support students as they work together to give feedback to one another.

- Prompt students to Pair-Share prior to the end of the work session:

“What strengths are evident in your partner’s work, as aligned to the criteria?” (Responses will vary.)

“What are areas of focus or revision for your partner?” (Responses will vary.)

- Provide time for students to share feedback verbally and/or give written feedback on sticky notes.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

- If productive, cue students to think about their thinking:

“How does our peer critique add to your understanding of drafting effective informative writing? I’ll give you time to think and discuss with a partner.” (Responses will vary.)

- Move students into groups of three or four, and invite them to read or think quietly about the feedback they received.

- Invite students to Think-Pair-Share while prompting them with the following series of questions:

“What trends do you notice in the feedback you received?” (Responses will vary.)

“How will you address this feedback? Share specific strategies you have for revising this work.” (Responses will vary.)

“What questions do you have about the feedback you received?” (Responses will vary.)

- Ask students to Turn and Talk:

“In what ways did you see classmates use appropriate eye contact, adequate volume, and clear pronunciation during the peer critique?” (Responses will vary.)

“In what ways did you use appropriate eye contact, adequate volume, and clear pronunciation in your work in the peer critique?” (Responses will vary.)

- As time allows, invite students to begin to incorporate feedback by revising their essays. Clarify any feedback for students, and invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- Students who need heavier support may have trouble verbalizing feedback for their peers. Help them identify key elements of the informative writing checklist, and encourage them to use this as a resource. Provide sentence starters to help students articulate notices and wonders for their partners (e.g., “I notice that you \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ in order to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.”; “I wonder if this idea would be clear if you \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.”)

For Heavier Support

- Invite students to share what their partners said to promote attentive listening, retelling, paraphrasing, and peer language modeling. Since students are accustomed to sharing out their own answer, explain why this is helpful, and provide them with frames and a model first: “My partner (or name of student) said \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.”

Homework

A. Revise Informative Essays

- Students revise their essays based on the feedback they received during the peer critique, paying attention to transitions, domain-specific vocabulary, and correct spelling.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent** **reading** **journal**.
