**To GMO or NOT to GMO?**

**Genetically engineered food has strong advocates and harsh critics.**

by George Erdosh and Marcia Amidon Lusted

It used to be that when you were strolling through the grocery store, you might have looked for labels that advertised foods that were low in calories or sodium. But as our food supply has changed, science plays a bigger role in what we eat. Today, one of the biggest controversies in your grocery store is whether that can or box or jar contains genetically modified organisms, or GMOs. It is estimated that 60 to 70 percent of all processed foods available on store shelves contain GMO ingredients, particularly corn or high fructose corn syrup, soybeans, and cottonseed or canola oils. If you drink soda or eat snack foods or breakfast cereals, chances are good that you’re already eating GMO ingredients.

**Why Say Yes?**

1.  “\[T\]here is abundant evidence that currently grown GE (genetically engineered) crops have **major benefits worldwide** and that foods made from those crops are **safe to eat**.” — *Greg Jaffe, director of biotechnology at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, writing in* The Atlantic

2.  GMO crops may produce **more food** for human consumption. Jaffe says, “GE crops are not the primary solution to food security in developing countries—but they could be helpful.”

3.  Improved nutrition, such as higher-than-natural levels of vitamin A, enhances **health and quality of life** for some people.

4.  Modified crops may be more **resistant to weeds, pests, disease, and/or drought**.

**Why Say No?**

5.  “There are just a lot of question marks, and I think many people have registered the concern **that we need to have more answers before we move forward** on having it commercially available at this point in time. — *Margaret Wittenberg, vice president of marketing and public affairs at Whole Foods Market, speaking to* WebMD

6.  “Certain farming practices utilizing \[GMO\] crops are **unsustainable**.” — *Greg Jaffe, director of biotechnology at the Center for Science in the Public Interest*

7.  The **impact on the environment** may include the development of “superweeds” or harm to species that are not pests.

8.  The **effects on the human body** of consuming GM food are not fully understood. Rot-resistant tomatoes, for example, are no longer being grown because of questions about possible **carcinogens**.

People think of GMO foods with the same suspicion that they have when they hear about cloning animals or drinking milk from cows that were given **bovine growth hormone**. These things change something that has existed in nature. Is this good? Is it safe? Before you can make up your mind about GMOs, especially when it comes to what you eat, let’s find out what genetic alteration really is.

**What Is Genetic Alteration?**

Biotechnology, the science that deals with genetic alteration, is a relatively new discipline that alters a plant on the **molecular** level. Let‘s get down to this level. DNA (short for deoxyribonucleic acid) is one of the basic elements in the cells of every living organism, whether they’re from a mushroom or a dinosaur or a human being. DNA provides the building blocks for your body’s genes. Each gene regulates a trait, like the color of your hair, the shape of an elephant’s trunk, or the sweetness of peas.

Scientists can clip a gene from the DNA of one plant and **splice** it into the DNA of another plant—that’s genetic alteration.

Here’s an example. The strawberry plant is very sensitive to frost. If it’s unprotected in the field and the temperature drops below freezing, that’s the end of your strawberry crop for this year. But parsley is resistant to frost. It has built-in antifreeze chemicals that protect it from even heavy frost. If the biotechnologist can splice that gene responsible for producing antifreeze chemicals from parsley into the strawberry plant, the farmer may be able to start planting strawberries three or four weeks earlier in the spring. We’ll have an earlier crop and longer harvest season.

Another example is plants’ resistance to disease or pests or drought. Some have it, others don’t. The ones that don’t may benefit from the ones that do by genetic alteration.

From Genes to GMOs**

**Changing Plants Isn’t New**

Ever since humans started growing plants some 10,000 years ago instead of picking them in the wild, farmers have improved plants a great deal. The original apples were the size of **crabapples**, bitter and flavorless; green peppers were cherry-sized and so hot that you were in agony should you bite into one. Without altering some of our plants, we couldn’t have survived and supported today’s huge world population.

The difference between then and now is the length of time that is necessary to develop new crop strains. Back then, farmers always selected and saved the best of their crops to plant as the next year’s seeds. This strategy of repeated selection for specific food qualities allowed food plants to slowly improve until we got large, juicy, tasty apples and sweet green peppers.

Today’s genetic alteration makes some of the same kinds of changes, but the results come in a few years.

**Advanced Modification**

Scientists believe that some alterations are as safe as the traditional method of slow plant breeding for improved food plants. There are genetically altered products that we have been using for at least 10 years without ill effect. Bakers’ yeast that produces more bubbles is one example.

However, today some of the genetic modifications to food are on a more advanced level, such as creating golden rice that provides extra vitamin A to combat blindness and death in **malnourished** children, or breeding a new type of sweet potato that has extra **beta carotene** (which the body converts to vitamin A). A new kind of tomato was bred to resist rotting and give it a longer shelf life. Potatoes are bred to produce more starch. Soybeans, one of the most common processed-food ingredients, are also one of the most heavily modified food products. Soybeans have been genetically modified to resist disease and pests, or to produce more protein, vitamins, and fat.

**How Safe Is It?**

There is no easy answer to the question of how safe GMO foods are, or what their long-term effects might be. Many people wonder about what unintended consequences GMO foods might have on the human body. Critics ask whether a rise in allergies is linked to GMO foods. Genetically modified crops can also contaminate other crops, including those intentionally grown without GMOs, affecting other farms in unforeseen ways.

Currently, consumers in Europe are less tolerant than Americans of GMO ingredients in their foods. Many will not buy foods with any GMOs in them, and some companies have adapted by offering a different version of their foods in Europe than they do in the United States. For example, General Mills now sells Cheerios in a non-GMO form in Europe, while the Cheerios sold in the US still contain cornstarch, sugar, and vitamin E in genetically modified forms.

**What’s the Bottom Line?**

In the end, it’s up to consumers to decide which type of food they want to buy, and to register their opinion on GMO foods the simplest way . . . with the power of their purchases. Sooner or later, companies will want to provide the products that people are buying the most. So cast your “vote” today!
