End of Unit 2 Assessment, Part II: Desktop Teaching Activity: Access to Healthy Food

(For Teacher Reference)

**Assessment**

For the End of Unit Assessment, Part II in Lesson 14, students will use their Desktop Teaching Activity Lesson Plan to teach a small group of peers about their research findings.

During the presentation, use the checklist below to assess each student’s speaking and listening skills to measure their mastery of SL.8.4 and SL.8.5. After the presentations, collect their Desktop Teaching Activity Lesson Plans. Use this additional, written evidence to add to your observations of each student’s ability to offer relevant evidence and well-chosen details. Use the Desktop Teaching Activity rubric to assess each student’s lesson plan to measure their mastery of RI.8.1, SL.8.4, SL.8.5, and L.8.6.

In preparation for the Desktop Teaching Activity, organize the room into small stations.

**Directions**

- Split the class into three groups, preferably by case study topic.

- Assign each student in the first group a station.

- These students will be the “teachers” of Round 1.

- Students in the first group will set up their presentation materials, including their lesson plan, informative essay (optional), exit tickets, and multimedia/visual display.

- Assign the remaining students to one of the stations. **Students should visit a station with a research topic that is different from their own in order to learn about a new topic.**

- Give the “teachers” 5 minutes to present their research findings. **Try using a timer that is visible for the entire class so students know how much time they have to present.**

- Circulate throughout the room, and **use the Presentation of Knowledge and Ideas checklist** to assess each student’s speaking and listening skills.

- After 5 minutes pass, give the “students” 2 minutes to answer their “teacher’s” exit ticket.

- Instruct each “teacher” to gather his or her materials and hand them in to you. **You will use the Desktop Teaching Activity rubric** to assess each student’s lesson plan, and check the exit tickets to make sure “students” were actively listening.

- Give the second group of “teachers” a few minutes to set up their presentation materials.

- Repeat the steps above for Round 2.

- Once Round 2 is complete, give the third group of “teachers” a few minutes to set up their presentation materials.

- Repeat the steps above for additional rounds as needed.

- After all rounds are finished, facilitate a whole-group share about the process and the case studies they learned about in this activity.

- Be sure you have collected all Desktop Teaching Activity Lesson Plans. They will be used to support your observations during this assessment.

**Grade 8 Presentation of Knowledge and Ideas Checklist**

To assess student progress, prepare one checklist for each student. For each criterion, circle the appropriate number using the following key:

1 = Beginning 2 = Developing 3 = Proficient 4 = Advanced

**Name:** **Date:**

Students orally present information, findings, and supporting evidence.
