End of Unit 2 Assessment, Part II: Desktop Teaching Activity

**Name:** **Date:**

**Directions:** Now that you have researched and written an essay about access to healthy food, you are going to teach your peers about your research findings. Using the one-page lesson plan graphic organizer and visuals you created in class, you are going to present your case study to a small group of classmates. The class will be organized into stations. Students will each take turns as “teachers” and show their small group of “students” what they learned. (SL.8.4, SL.8.5)

**Be sure you have prepared**

- a posted learning goal for participants,

- a visual that includes a title and your focus research question,

- an exit ticket for peers to answer after the presentation, and

- a Desktop Teaching Activity graphic organizer to use as speaking notes during the presentation.

**Your presentation should include**

- a brief overview of your case study,

- evidence for the advantages and disadvantages in your case study,

- inferences (“I Notice”) about the evidence you are discussing, and

- additional focus questions about the topic (“I Wonder”).

**An effective presenter**

- clearly presents claims and findings,

- highlights important points using evidence,

- uses appropriate eye contact with the audience,

- uses multimedia/visual displays to support claims and findings, and

- uses academic and domain-specific language.

Your teacher will give you directions about where and how to set up your station.
