Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.8.7 – Work Time A: Students learn or review steps in the research process based on the common issues identified in Lesson 3 during their research of GMOs.

- RI.8.1 - Work Time B: Students gather evidence to answer the additional related focus questions on their note-catcher.

- W.8.8 – Work Time B: Students work independently to evaluate sources and gather information to answer the additional related focus questions in their note-catchers. Students continue to track how factors influence our access to healthy food.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Students who have experience with any of the research steps should be authorized as experts on those steps and allowed to teach or mentor the class or individual students on the steps.

- Students may take a trip to the library and find other resources in addition to their internet resources. Invite students to extend their learning by working with a librarian to learn how to find texts for their research. This will prepare students for conducting research at the college level, as many professors require sources beyond the internet.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students were introduced to the four case studies: pesticides, food deserts, high-fructose corn syrup, and organic foods. Students were assigned to research one of these four case studies. In this lesson, students build upon their research skills from previous lessons by conducting independent internet research on their case study. They continue to track how their food topic increases or decreases our access to healthy food in their note-catcher.

Support All Students

- In Work Time B, students may need additional support with each of the steps of the research process. Provide sentence frames and modeling to support students with refining additional related focus questions. Use Research Mini Lessons (for teacher reference) with small groups of students based on the needs in the classroom, including how to assess the credibility of sources and how to quote or paraphrase evidence. Alternatively, partner students with a student who is skilled at researching and note-taking for modeling and support. ▲

- If possible, collaborate with a technology or computer teacher to support students in navigating the internet. In the next lesson, students will be assessed on their understanding of search terms, citing sources from websites, and determining the credibility of these websites.

- Encourage ELLs to explore online sources on the topic in their home languages before researching the topic using English-language sources. This will help students to build a foundational understanding of content and concepts before navigating information in English. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson provides further opportunities for students to build research skills through mini research lessons and by providing choice in topics while carrying out research. For ELLs especially, working with a subtopic that is particularly interesting will enable students to engage more thoroughly with texts.

- ELLs may find it intimidating to choose a case study to research. Encourage ELLs to select the case study that they are most intrigued by, but help students to understand that choosing the topic they worked with in a small group during the jigsaw activity (pesticides) in Lesson 4 may be a good choice because of their level of familiarity with it. As needed, build in time to discuss search terms to help guide students in carrying out research.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6 and 8.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- Circulate to monitor students’ Access to Healthy Food: Independent Research note-catchers and their ability to apply the research skills they developed in this lesson and previous lessons.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will take the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment, which will assess the research skills they developed in Lessons 1–5. In Lessons 7–11, students will use the evidence they gathered from their research to write an informative essay about their case study.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.8.8 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **2**, **Lesson** **5**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Mini Lesson: Research – W.8.7 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can conduct research to answer a question about factors that influence our access to healthy food.”

- Remind students that they read a text about their case study in the previous lesson and gathered evidence from the text that answers their central research question. Explain to students that they will build upon that research as they conduct independent internet research in this lesson.

- Display **Access** **to** **Healthy** **Food**: **Independent** **Research** **note** - **catcher**, and ask students to retrieve their copy. Ask a volunteer to reread the directions.

- Focus students on the top section of the note-catcher. Instruct students to write the additional related focus questions they will use to guide their research, in the space provided. Encourage students to use at least one of the additional related focus questions from the previous lesson that their classmates suggested in Closing and Assessment A, if helpful. Students may also continue using the same questions they used in the previous lesson if needed.

- Instruct students to also record the search terms they will use, in the space provided. Remind students that they generated and used additional related focus questions and search terms in previous lessons to conduct their research.

- Circulate as students work to ensure they are on task. Support struggling students as needed with prompting questions to help them determine the additional related focus questions and search terms they need to guide their internet research. See **Access** **to** **Healthy** **Food**: **Independent** **Research** **note** - **catcher** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Inform students that based on their research in the previous lesson, research mini lessons have been selected to address their specific research needs to help them be more effective researchers. Use **Research** **Mini** **Lessons** (**for** **teacher** **reference**) based on students’ needs. Encourage students to refer to the **Researcher’s** **Toolbox** handout as needed.

- Release those students who are proficient in the research process to begin researching independently.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the learning target.

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time A, modify the mini research lessons so that practice tasks can be accomplished in small groups as student-led activities. Group students according to their needs, and, if time allows, have students come together as a whole class to share what they learned during their work with a mini lesson topic.

Work Time

B. Independent Research – W.8.8 (20 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can conduct research to answer a question about factors that influence our access to healthy food.”

- Remind students that their research will answer the question:

- “How do(es) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ influence our access to healthy food?”

- Allow students a few minutes to review their notes, then have them Turn and Talk to share their plan for researching. Use a Thumb-O-Meter to assess who needs help researching.

- Display the **Researchers** **Do** **These** **Things** **anchor** **chart**, and ask a volunteer to read through the steps listed to remind them of how they should conduct their research.

- Invite students to retrieve the **Research** **Texts** and distribute **devices** for students to conduct their research.

- Remind students to gather their evidence, sources, and research findings in their Access to Healthy Food: Independent Research note-catcher as they track how their case study influences our access to healthy food.

- Circulate and support students. Depending on needs, pair students or draw them into a small group to assist them, using the suggestions in Research Mini Lessons (for teacher reference). If many students need support, group them by steps in the research process (e.g., groups of students working together to cite sources, take notes, and find and evaluate new sources). ▲ Refer to Access to Healthy Food: Independent Research note-catcher (example for teacher reference).

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the learning target.

Closing and Assessment

A. Whole Group Share (5 minutes)

- Refocus the whole class.

- Direct students’ attention to the Access to Healthy Food: Independent Research note-catcher.

- Ask:

“What is the most interesting or surprising information you discovered in your research?” (Responses will vary.)

- Explain that students will be assessed on their research skills in the next lesson.

For Lighter Support

For Heavier Support

- Encourage ELLs to discuss their research findings with peers who share the same home language before talking about it in English. This will help students to process the information they are gathering without linguistic interference; some students may understand what they read but struggle to apply the productive skills needed to explain it in English.

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent** **reading** **journal**.
