<td colspan="2"><strong>Case Study Overview:</strong> The purpose of the study was to determine how GMOs influence our access to healthy food. Scientists use technology to splice new genes from one plant to another to create genetically modified foods. This biotechnology is used to make crops resistant to pests and disease and enhance our food. Agribusiness corporations support their claims that GMOs are safe. However, some consumers are skeptical because GMOs are unnatural and want more substantial research from scientists outside of these corporations.</td>

<td><p><strong>First Point</strong></p>
<p>GMOs seem to improve access to healthy foods.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“In fact, GMO canola oil has fewer trans fats than regular canola oil” (bestfoods.org).</p></li>
<li><p>“Finally, the new genes in some corn make it harder for harmful insects to survive. This means that farmers who grow the GMO corn have been able to use fewer pesticides” (Brody, 2018).</p></li>
<li><p>“First, GMO corn has increased the amount of corn available. A review of 6,000 studies between 1996 and 2016 showed that GMOs had increased production of corn by up to 25 percent” (Dovey, 2018).</p></li>
</ul></td>
<td><p><strong>Second Point</strong></p>
<p>The safety of GMOs is questionable.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Others point out that GMOs have not been in use long enough for us to be certain they are safe” (Brody, 2018).</p></li>
<li><p>“For example, the <em>New York Times</em> reported in 2018 about a GMO called EnlistDuo. It is supposed to make crop plants more resistant to weed-killing chemicals. However, it has been found to increase the prevalence of a cancer called non-Hodgkins lymphoma” (Brody, 2018).</p></li>
</ul></td>

<td><p><strong>I Notice:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>GMO plants last longer because they are resistant to pests and disease.</p></li>
<li><p>Scientists can change the nature of foods with genetic engineering.</p></li>
<li><p>There isn’t much research on GMOs’ long-term effects on the human body.</p></li>
<li><p>Some GMOs can cause cancer.</p></li>
</ul></td>
<td><p><strong>I Wonder:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>What are some other foods that have been enhanced with GMOs?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the plans for additional research on the effects of GMOs on humans?</p></li>
<li><p>How can scientists ensure the safety of GMOs before selling them to the public?</p></li>
