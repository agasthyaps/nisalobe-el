End of Unit 2 Assessment, Part I: Desktop Teaching Activity Lesson Plan and Rubric

(For Teacher Reference)

**Preparation**

In Lessons 7–11, students plan and draft an informative essay about how the topic of their case study influences our access to healthy food.

In Lessons 12 and 13, students transfer context and evidence from their essay into the Desktop Teaching Activity Lesson Plan. Students also create or find multimedia/visual displays to add to their presentation and practice presenting.

In Lesson 12, students create their lesson plans for the End of Unit 2 Assessment, Part 1.

In Lesson 14, students present their Desktop Teaching Activity Lesson using their plans and visuals.

The written plan created in Lesson 12, and used during the presentation, will support your observations on the content of the Desktop Teaching Activity Lesson. Use the sample responses and the provided rubric to assess the strength of each student’s points, their ability to support their points with relevant evidence and well-chosen details, and their application of academic and domain-specific vocabulary.

<td colspan="2"><strong>Case Study Overview: The purpose of the study was to determine how GMOs influence our access to healthy food. Scientists use technology to splice new genes from one plant to another to create genetically modified foods. This biotechnology is used to make crops resistant to pests and disease and enhance our food. Agribusiness corporations support their claims that GMOs are safe. However, some consumers are skeptical because GMOs are unnatural and want more substantial research from scientists outside of these corporations.</strong></td>

<p><strong>GMOs seem to improve access to healthy foods.</strong></p>

**Grade 8 Research Presentation Rubric**

To assess student progress, prepare one rubric for each student. Circle or highlight the appropriate column using the following key:

1 = Beginning 2 = Developing 3 = Proficient 4 = Advanced

**Name:** **Date:**

Conduct a short research project and present findings.
