**Focus Question:**

How do CSAs influence our access to healthy food?

Focus

What is the main idea of your piece?

CSAs positively impact our access to healthy food and have many advantages. The food in CSAs is high quality, healthy food and because CSAs are a local food, they have a positive impact on how many fossil fuels are used to transport them.

Introduction

How will you catch the reader’s attention?

- Accessing healthy food is a basic need

- It is complicated

- Ask a series of questions like: Do we have enough money? Is it available?

What context do you need to give your reader?

- Give definition of CSAs

- Explain how people participate in and use CSAs

- Give a statistic of how many people use CSAs

Write your focus statement.

CSAs have an influence on our access to healthy food. They have many advantages. Two of the most important are the high quality of the food itself and the positive impact on the use of fossil fuels.

What are the main points you will be making to support this focus?

First Point: There is general agreement that CSAs can produce high quality food.

Second Point: In addition to increasing access to healthy food through freshness and variety, CSAs increase access to healthy food by having a positive impact on the use of fossil fuels.

Proof Paragraph(s) for Point 1

What is the first point that supports your focus statement?

There is general agreement that CSAs can produce high quality food.

**Evidence**

What evidence from the texts supports this point?

- Food that comes from far away is older. It has traveled many miles, and has probably sat in a warehouse, before you buy it (Grobinger, University of Vermont, 2010).

- “Once produce is harvested, its optimal nutritional value decreases, specifically in vitamins A, B, C and E” (Cleveland Clinic, 2016).

- Besides the benefit of being so fresh, food from a CSA gives the consumer many choices (Cleveland Clinic, 2016).

- Depending on the time in the growing season, the weekly CSA box contains many different types of fruits and vegetables. In early summer, the customer may get berries, lettuce, and asparagus. Later, foods could include potatoes, watermelon, and apples. The local CSA also gives out information and recipes about how to use this variety of fresh food (Cleveland Clinic, 2016).

How does this evidence support this point?

CSA food is:

- locally grown, consumers eat it shortly after it has been harvested.

- ready to eat shortly after harvest.

- very fresh and has higher nutrient levels.

- likely to be healthier than the food from a supermarket, it has been so recently picked.

<!-- -->

- CSAs make it easier for people to eat healthy food.

  - access to healthy food increases.

Proof Paragraph(s) for Point 2

What is the next point that supports your focus statement?

In addition to increasing access to healthy food through freshness and variety, CSAs increase access to healthy food by having a positive impact on the use of fossil fuels.

**Evidence**

What evidence from the texts supports this point?

- Food generally has to travel around 1,500 miles to get from the farmer to the consumer (Pollan, p. 158).

- “Reducing the distance food travels (food miles) cuts down on associated fossil fuel consumption, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions” (Utah State University Extension, 2012).

- The average temperature has gone up by 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit since 1800. Burning fossil fuels is the major cause of this increase (Union of Concerned Scientists, 2015).

How does this evidence support this point?

- A lot of fossil fuel is burned just moving food.

- Reduction in fossil fuel use matters a lot for the environment.

- While 1.5 degrees may not seem like a lot, scientists agree that it makes a huge difference.

- How healthy the planet is will have a lot to do with people’s access to healthy food.

- Cutting down on fossil fuel use by buying food from CSAs will improve access to healthy food.

Conclusion

Restate your focus statement from the introduction.

Overall, most indications are that CSAs improve people’s access to healthy food.

What are your further reflections on this topic?

- CSAs are important for users’ access to healthy food

- Need to support more CSAs

- CSAs serve planet and people well—now and in future
