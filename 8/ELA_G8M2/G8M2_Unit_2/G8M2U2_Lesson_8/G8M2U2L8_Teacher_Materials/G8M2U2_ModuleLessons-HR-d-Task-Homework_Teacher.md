focus statement

1.  How many points were used in the focus statement of the Model Essay: “GMOs”?

2.  one

3.  <u>two</u>

4.  three

5.  four

6.  How are the Proof Paragraphs related to the focus statement in a Painted Essay®?

There are two points made in the focus statement of a Painted Essay®, and each Proof Paragraph explains one of the points made in the focus statement.

7.  How is the Model Essay: “GMOs” similar to and different from the Model Essay: “CSAs”?

Both essays are similar in structure: they have an introduction that includes a focus statement, two supporting points that are developed into Proof Paragraphs, and a conclusion that wraps it up. They are different because the “GMOs” model essay references one increase in access to healthy food and one decrease in access to healthy food, but in the “CSAs” model essay, each Proof Paragraph describes a different advantage related to access to healthy food.

**Model Essay: “CSAs”**

**RI.8.1, W.8.2, W.8.4, W.8.7, W.8.8, W.8.10, L.8.6**

**Prompt:** How do CSAs influence our access to healthy food?

Access to healthy food is a basic human need, and it can be complicated. In America today, many factors influence our access to healthy food. Do we have enough money to buy healthy food? Is healthy food available where we live? Can we find food that is grown in good soil? Can we find food that is free of chemicals that might cause harm? Can our soil and water contribute to growing healthy food? Can we find healthy food from healthy animals? All of these are factors we consider when we think about access to healthy food. Today, one way of getting food is through a CSA. The term **CSA** stands for “community supported agriculture.” CSAs work by subscription. At the beginning of the growing season, people buy shares in a local farm. In exchange, they get fruits and vegetables (and sometimes meat or dairy) over the course of the growing season. This is usually around twenty weeks, from June through October (Cleveland Clinic, 2016). One estimate from Penn State says that between 30,000 and 50,000 people in the United States belong to a CSA (Penn State Extension, 2014). CSAs have an influence on our access to healthy food. They have many advantages. Two of the most important are the high quality of the food itself and the positive impact on the use of fossil fuels.

There is general agreement that CSAs can produce high-quality food. Much of this is because it is locally grown, and the consumers eat it shortly after it has been harvested. Food that comes from far away is older. It has traveled many miles, and has probably sat in a warehouse, before you buy it (Grobinger, University of Vermont, 2010). According to dietician Beth Bluestone from the Cleveland Clinic, “Once produce is harvested, its optimal nutritional value decreases, specifically in vitamins A, B, C and E” (Cleveland Clinic, 2016). Food from a local CSA, however, is ready to eat shortly after harvest. This means that the food from a CSA is very fresh and has higher nutrient levels. Clearly, the food that people get from a CSA is likely to be healthier than even the food from a supermarket, because it has been so recently picked. Besides the benefit of being so fresh, food from a CSA gives the consumer many choices (Cleveland Clinic, 2016). Depending on the time in the growing season, the weekly CSA box contains many different types of fruits and vegetables. In early summer, the customer may get berries, lettuce, and asparagus. Later, foods could include potatoes, watermelon, and apples. The local CSA also gives out information and recipes about how to use this variety of fresh food (Cleveland Clinic, 2016). All of this makes it easier for people to eat healthy food, so their access to healthy food has increased.

In addition to increasing access to healthy food through freshness and variety, CSAs increase access to healthy food by having a positive impact on the use of fossil fuels. In *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Michael Pollan points out that food generally has to travel around 1,500 miles to get from the farmer to the consumer (Pollan, 158). That means a lot of fossil fuel is burned just moving food. Compared to that, CSA crops are local and so travel only a very short distance to get to the consumer. As Utah State University Extension notes, “Reducing the distance food travels (food miles) cuts down on associated fossil fuel consumption, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions” (Utah State University Extension, 2012). This reduction in fossil fuel use matters a lot for the environment. The climate of the planet is changing; the average temperature has gone up by 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit since 1800. Burning fossil fuels is the major cause of this increase (Union of Concerned Scientists, 2015). While 1.5 degrees may not seem like a lot, scientists agree that it is making a huge difference. Ultimately, how healthy the planet is will have a lot to do with people’s access to healthy food. So, cutting down on fossil fuel use by buying food from CSAs will improve access to healthy food.

Overall, most indications are that CSAs improve people’s access to healthy food. Even though 50,000 people using them does not seem like a lot, CSAs play an important part for those users in having reliable access to healthy food. If we as a society could support the creation of more CSAs, we would be serving our people and our planet well, both now and in the future.

**Model Essay: “GMOs”**

**RI.8.1, W.8.2, W.8.4, W.8.7, W.8.8, W.8.10, L.8.6**

**Prompt:** How do GMOs influence our access to healthy food?

Access to healthy food is a basic human need. It can be complicated. In America today, many factors influence our access to healthy food. Do we have enough money to buy healthy food? Is healthy food available where we live? Can we find food that is grown in good soil? Can we find food that is free of chemicals that might cause harm? Can our soil and water contribute to growing healthy food? Can we find healthy food from healthy animals? All of these are factors we consider when we think about access to healthy food. Today, some foods are the result of genetic changes that have been made by scientists. These are known as GMOs, or genetically modified organisms. GMOs are made by splicing new genes from one plant into another. This changes the plant in some way. For example, a plant scientist might want to find a way to grow strawberries that are resistant to frost. This would allow the growing season to last longer. She might take the “frost gene” from parsley (which can take a frost) and splice it into strawberry plants. The new strawberry plants would be a form of GMO (Erdosh and Lusted, 17). GMOs influence our access to healthy food. In many ways, GMOs seem to improve access to healthy foods. In other ways, the safety and benefit of GMOs are still being questioned.

There are many cases in which GMOs seem to improve Americans’ access to healthy foods. First, GMO corn has increased the amount of corn available. A review of 6,000 studies between 1996 and 2016 showed that GMOs had increased production of corn by up to 25 percent (Dovey, 2018). This is important because much of the food supply depends on many animals eating corn. Also, corn is used in many other food products. This means that increasing the amount of corn means more people have dependable access to food. Some people have been worried that there is a nutritional difference between GMO and non-GMO food. However, there seems to be no difference. In fact, GMO canola oil has fewer trans fats than regular canola oil (bestfoods.org). Canola oil is used to make many other foods. This means that GMOs may actually increase people’s access to healthy food. Finally, the new genes in some corn make it harder for harmful insects to survive. This means that farmers who grow the GMO corn have been able to use fewer pesticides (Brody, 2018). In the long run, GMOs can increase people’s access to healthy food because there is more food and fewer pesticides in the soil, water, and the food itself.

Although GMOs seem to improve access to healthy food, questions about the safety of using GMOs still remain. Some of these questions have to do with long-term effects on consumers’ health. For example, the *New York Times* reported in 2018 about a GMO called EnlistDuo. It is supposed to make crop plants more resistant to weed-killing chemicals. However, it has been found to increase the prevalence of a cancer called non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (Brody, 2018). Others point out that GMOs have not been in use long enough for us to be certain they are safe (Brody, 2018). If GMOs may make people sick, they are not improving their access to healthy food. Another question is about the health of the soil that GMO crops are growing in. Some studies show that it is true that pesticide use has fallen by a third with GMOs. This certainly makes for healthier soil. However, the same studies show that herbicide use (weed killers) has increased by 21 percent with GMO crops (Hakim, 2016). This raises the question about whether GMOs are really good for the soil and the supply of healthy food. Finally, the fact that GMOs have improved corn yields may not have an entirely helpful impact. As Michael Pollan points out in *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, cattle in feedlots are fed corn because it fattens them quickly. However, corn is not their natural food. He explains, “Their corn-based diet . . . makes them ill” (Pollan, 70). As a result, the cattle have to be given antibiotics, which causes other problems. As with herbicides, this raises the question about whether increasing the corn supply with GMOs has improved access to healthy meat, or made it worse. The Non-GMO Project explains that “in the absence of credible independent long-term feeding studies, the safety of GMOs is unknown. Increasingly, citizens are taking matters into their own hands and choosing to opt out of the GMO experiment.” Over time, it is possible that GMOs may prove to decrease people’s access to healthy food because they may be dangerous to consume or may have a negative impact on our food industry.

Overall, there are indications that GMOs improve people’s access to healthy food. At the same time, many questions and potential harms to health remain. It seems sensible to very closely study and monitor the effects of GMOs on human health, animal health, and soil and water. Having reliable access to healthy food, both short and long term, is too important to leave to chance.
