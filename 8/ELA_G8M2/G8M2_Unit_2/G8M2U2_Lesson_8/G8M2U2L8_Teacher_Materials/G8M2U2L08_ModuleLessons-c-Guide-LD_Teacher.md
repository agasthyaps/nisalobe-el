Language Dive Guide: Model Essay:  
“GMOs,” Paragraph 1

W.8.2a, L.8.1b, L.8.3a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

In other ways, the safety and benefit of GMOs **are still being questioned.** (from paragraph 1 of Model Essay: “GMOs” by EL Education)

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: To help students address the daily learning target  
  (**I can plan an introduction to an informative essay that includes a strong focus statement**) and W.8.2a by providing an example of the first sentence in a focus statement from a model essay. This sentence also helps to address L.8.1b because it is written in passive voice. Supporting Standards: SL.8.1

- Guiding Question: To help students respond to the guiding question (**What factors influence our access to healthy food?**), this sentence makes a statement about a factor: GMOs.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses the passive voice with the purpose of emphasizing the recipient of an action. Invite students to discuss each chunk briefly, but encourage extended conversation and practice with the focus structure: **are still being questioned.**

- Practice and Transfer: After discussing the focus structure, students practice using it to discuss something in their lives. Students transfer their understanding of the meaning and structure of this sentence when writing informative essays in preparation for the Desktop Teaching Protocol on the End of Unit 2 Assessment.

Launch

- Invite students to review the first two sentences of the focus structure in Model Essay: “GMOs.”

Deconstruct

- Invite students to put their finger by this sentence from Model Essay: “GMOs” on their note-catchers: **In other ways, the safety and benefit of GMOs <u>are still being questioned</u>**.

- Read aloud the sentence twice, and then ask students to take turns reading the sentence aloud with their partners.

- Ask:

“What does this sentence mean to you?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“How does this sentence add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

In other ways,

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **In other ways,**

- Ask:

“Consider the sentence that comes before this one in the focus statement of the model essay. Why do you think the writer starts this sentence with this chunk?” (To link the information together. The sentence before this one previews information about ways in which GMOs provide access to healthy food.)

“What kind of information do you expect to follow this linking phrase?” (This linking phrase signals that the information to follow will be about something other than how GMOs improve access to healthy food.)

- As needed, to support students in responding to the question above, invite them to reread the first two sentences of the focus statement of Model Essay: “GMOs.”

the safety and benefit of GMOs

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **the safety and benefit of GMOs**

- Ask:

“Is this chunk talking about something positive or negative? What makes you think so?” (Positive. Safety and benefit are generally considered favorable things.)

“What do you already know about the safety and benefit of GMOs from your research?” (Responses will vary. Acknowledge and encourage all replies.)

are still being questioned.

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **are still being questioned.**

- Ask:

“What are still being questioned?” (the safety and benefit of GMOs)

“Can you figure out the main verb in this predicate?” (questioned)

- Underline questioned in red, and invite students to do the same on their note-catchers. 

“Can you figure out the helping verbs in this predicate?” (are; being)

- Underline are and being in red, and invite students to do the same on their note-catchers. 

- Explain to students that this verb is written in passive voice. In English, most sentences are written in active voice, but writers sometimes use passive voice to emphasize something important. Passive voice looks slightly different depending on a verb’s tense, but verbs in passive voice are formed by using the helping verb **to be** with the past participle (**-en** or **-ed**) of the main verb.

- Display the predicate in active voice: **are still questioning**

- Ask:

“What differences do you notice between this present continuous verb in active and passive voice? (Responses will vary, but look for students to notice that the active voice predicate has only one helping verb \[are\], whereas the passive construction has two \[are; being\], and that the main verb question ends in -ing in the active voice predicate and in -ed in the passive voice predicate.)

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Display the sentence:

**Students are reading articles about GMOs.**

- Display the sentence frame:

> **Articles about GMOs <u>\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_</u> by students.**

passive present continuous verb

> (**is**/**are** + **being** + verb + **-en**/**-ed** = passive present continuous verb)
>
> (object + passive present continuous verb + **by** + subject = sentence in passive voice)

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use this frame to rewrite the sentence from active to passive voice.”

In other ways, the safety and benefit of GMOs are still being questioned.

Reconstruct

- Point to and read aloud the entire sentence on display: **In other ways, the safety and benefit of GMOs <u>are still being questioned</u>**.

- Ask:

“Can you figure out who is questioning the safety and benefit of GMOs? How do you know?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to recognize that it’s likely that people in general are questioning this. The subject has been omitted from this sentence, so we have to rely on contextual knowledge to determine this.)

- Tell students that in passive voice, a sentence’s subject appears at the end of the sentence after the word *by* or is omitted entirely. As needed, refer back to the focus structure practice sentence frame for an example of this.

- Ask:

“The subject of the verb in this sentence has been omitted. If the safety and benefit of GMOs isn’t the subject, what is it?” (It’s the direct object.)

- If productive, give an example to cue students to expand the conversation:

“What, in the sentence, makes you think so?” (Responses will vary.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- Display the sentence in active voice to help students see that **the safety and benefit of GMOs** is the direct object:

**People are still questioning the safety and benefit of GMOs.**

- Ask:

“How does this sentence help to introduce the topic of Model Essay: ‘GMOs’”? (It previews the second point that supports the main claim of the essay.)

“What does this sentence tell us about the topic of the essay: How GMOs impact our access to healthy food?” (It tells us that there may be problems with the safety and benefit of GMOs.)

“Is this sentence previewing a positive or negative effect of GMOs on access to healthy food?” (Negative. It’s telling us that there may be problems with GMOs.)

- Ask:

“What other questions can we ask that will help us understand this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

> **On the other hand, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**
>
> direct object passive present continuous verb
>
> (linking phrase + direct object + passive present continuous verb)
>
> (**is**/**are** + **being** + verb + **-en**/**-ed** = passive present continuous verb)

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use this frame to draft a sentence in the focus statement of your essay that introduces the second point you will discuss.”

- Remind students that posting the chunks in language categories will help them use the language again for future speaking and writing tasks.

- Call on volunteers:

“Now take each chunk and post it to the appropriate column of the Language Chunk Wall. You can refer to these chunks again as you speak and write.”
