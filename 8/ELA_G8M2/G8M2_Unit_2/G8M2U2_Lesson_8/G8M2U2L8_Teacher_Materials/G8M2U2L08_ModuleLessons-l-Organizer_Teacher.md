**Focus Question:**

How do GMOs influence our access to healthy food?

**Focus**

What is the main idea of your piece?

GMOs influence our access to healthy food, which can increase people’s access to food that is better for them, but there is not enough research about the safety and benefits.

**Introduction**

How will you catch the reader’s attention?

- Accessing healthy food is a basic need.

- It is complicated.

- Ask a series of questions like: Do we have enough money? Is it available?

What context do you need to give your reader?

- Give definition of GMOs

- Explain how they are made

- Give example of frost-resistant strawberries

Write your focus statement.

GMOs influence our access to healthy food. In many ways, GMOs seem to improve access to healthy food. In other ways, the safety and benefit of GMOs are still being questioned.

What are the main points you will be making to support this focus?

First Point: There are many cases in which GMOs seem to improve Americans’ access to healthy food.

Second Point: Although GMOs seem to improve access to healthy food, questions about the safety of using GMOs still remain.

**Proof Paragraph(s) for Point 1**

What is the first point that supports your focus statement?

There are many cases in which GMOs seem to improve Americans’ access to healthy food.

**Evidence**

What evidence from the texts supports this point?

- A review of 6,000 studies between 1996 and 2016 showed that GMOs had increased production of corn by up to 25 percent (Dovey, 2018).

- GMO canola oil has fewer trans fats than regular canola oil (bestfoods.org).

- Farmers who grow GMO corn have been able to use fewer pesticides (Brody, 2018).

How does this evidence support this point?

- GMO corn has increased the amount of corn available.

- Much of the food supply depends on many animals eating corn.

- Some people have been worried that there is a nutritional difference between GMO and non-GMO food.

- There seems to be no difference.

- It’s harder for harmful insects to survive.

**Proof Paragraph(s) for Point 2**

What is the next point that supports your focus statement?

Although GMOs seem to improve access to healthy food, questions about the safety of using GMOs still remain.

**Evidence**

What evidence from the texts supports this point?

- The *New York Times* reported in 2018 about a GMO called EnlistDuo. It is supposed to make crop plants more resistant to weed-killing chemicals. However, it has been found to increase the prevalence of a cancer called non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (Brody, 2018).

- GMOs have not been in use long enough for us to be certain they are safe (Brody, 2018).

- It is true that pesticide use has fallen by a third with GMOs. This certainly makes for healthier soil. However, the same studies show that herbicide use (weed killers) has increased by 21 percent with GMO crops (Hakim, 2016).

- “\[T\]heir corn-based diet . . . makes them ill” (Pollan, 70).

How does this evidence support this point?

- questions about long-term effects on consumers’ health

- GMOs may prove to decrease people’s access to healthy food.

- may be dangerous to consume or may have a negative impact on our food industry

- GMOs have improved corn yields but may not have an entirely helpful impact.

- Are GMOs really good for the soil and the supply of healthy food?

- Cattle have to be given antibiotics, which causes other problems.

**Conclusion**

Restate your focus statement from the introduction.

Overall, there are indications that GMOs improve people’s access to healthy food. At the same time, many questions and potential harms to health remain.

What are your further reflections on this topic?

- Reliable access to healthy food is too important.

- Don’t leave it to chance.

- Study and monitor the effects of GMOs on humans, animals, and the environment.
