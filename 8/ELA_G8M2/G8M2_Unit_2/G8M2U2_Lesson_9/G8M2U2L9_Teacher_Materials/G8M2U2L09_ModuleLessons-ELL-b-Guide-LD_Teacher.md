5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

W.8.2b, L.8.1a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

In addition to increasing access to healthy food through freshness and variety, CSAs increase access to healthy food **by having a positive impact on the use of fossil fuels.** (from paragraph 4 of Model Essay: “CSAs”)

**Lesson 9 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after students have participated in the Language Dive in Work  
Time A. This mini is intended to support students in comparing and contrasting the topic sentences of Proof Paragraph 2s in each of the model essays to help them better understand the purpose and structure of each essay.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target (**I can plan Proof Paragraph 2 of an informative essay, including a point that is supported by facts and details**) and W.8.2b by providing students with an opportunity to consider how the first sentence in a Proof Paragraph introduces a new point to develop the topic. The sentence also helps students to address L.8.1a because it contains an infinitive (**to improve**). Supporting Standards: SL.8.1

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses a gerund phrase with the purpose of introducing the second point in a model essay.

- Transfer: **by** + gerund phrase to describe actions in various writing tasks, including when writing the informative essay in preparation for the End of Unit 2 Assessment.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **In addition to increasing access to healthy food through freshness and variety, CSAs increase access to healthy food <u>by having a positive impact on the use of fossil fuels.</u>**

- Ask:

“What is this sentence about?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **by having a positive impact on the use of fossil fuels.**

- Ask:

“What do you know about fossil fuels?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all replies.)

“What does this chunk tell us about CSAs?” (This tells us <u>how</u> CSAs impact access to healthy food—specifically, that they help to reduce the use of fossil fuels.)

“Can you find a gerund in this chunk?” (having)

“Can you figure out the function of the gerund phrase having a positive impact on the use of fossil fuels within this chunk? Is it a noun, an adjective, or an adverb? What makes you think so?” (It’s a noun. We know that gerunds and gerund phrases always function as nouns. We can also use the preposition by to help us determine this, because we know that nouns and noun phrases follow prepositions.)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **In addition to increasing access to healthy food through freshness and variety, CSAs increase access to healthy food <u>by having a positive impact on the use of fossil fuels.</u>**

- Remind students that this is the topic sentence of Proof Paragraph 2 of the model essay. It introduces the second point that supports the writer’s main claim: CSAs have an influence on our access to healthy food. Explain that students will experiment with removing parts of the sentence to understand the purpose of each one.

- Ask:

“What happens if we remove by having a positive impact on the use of fossil fuels from this sentence?” (The sentence still make sense, but we no longer have information about <u>how</u> CSAs increase access to healthy food.)

“What happens if we remove In addition to increasing access to healthy food through freshness and variety, from this sentence?” (The sentence still makes sense, but we no longer have a link between the point discussed in the last paragraph and the point being introduced by this topic sentence.)

“What happens if we remove CSAs increase access to healthy food from this sentence?” (The sentence does not make sense. We need this restatement of the main claim of the essay in order to understand the point that is presented in the final portion of this sentence: by having a positive impact on the use of fossil fuels.)

- Ask:

“What kind of information do you expect to follow this topic sentence in Proof Paragraph 2 of the model essay?” (further information about the relationship between CSAs and fossil fuels)

“How is this topic sentence the same as and different from the topic sentence in Proof Paragraph 2 of Model Essay: “GMOs”? (Responses will vary, but look for students to notice that each follows a similar structure of 1) referring back to the first point in the essay, 2) restating the main claim of the essay, and 3) introducing the second point that supports the main claim. Also look for students to notice that these topic sentences are different: the topic sentence in Model Essay: “GMOs” contains a pro and a con, while this topic sentence contains two pros about how CSAs influence access to healthy food.)

- Note: As needed, allow students to refer back to Model Essay: “GMOs” to reread the topic sentence of Proof Paragraph 2.

- Ask:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does this Mini Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target: I can identify evidence to support an analysis of the influence GMOs have on our access to healthy food”? (Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Sentence frame:

> **In addition to increasing access to healthy food through** <u>\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_</u>,
>
> noun/noun phrase
>
> <u>\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_</u> **increase(s) access to healthy food by** <u>\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_</u>**.**
>
> noun/noun phrase gerund phrase
>
> (verb + **-ing** + \[object\] + \[adverb/adjective\] = gerund phrase)

- Say:

“Use this frame to draft a topic sentence for Proof Paragraph 2 of an essay that discusses two positive ways that something influences access to healthy foods.”

> Sample response:
>
> **In addition to increasing access to healthy food through <u>many seasonal produce options,</u>**
>
> noun/noun phrase
>
> **<u>farmer’s markets</u> increase access to healthy food by <u>making food available close to home.</u>**
>
> noun/noun phrase gerund phrase

(verb + **-ing** = gerund)
