(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, answer the following prompts related to the Model Essay: “GMOs.”

1.  How does a writer use elaboration in an informative essay?

Elaboration is used to clarify the writer’s message. It connects and further explains the evidence in a Proof Paragraph to the main point of the paragraph and to the focus statement of the essay.

2.  Which elaboration sentence best aligns to the evidence below?

“A review of 6,000 studies between 1996 and 2016 showed that GMOs had increased production of corn by up to 25 percent (Dovey, 2018).”

3.  This raises the question about whether GMOs are really good for the soil and the supply of healthy food.

4.  If GMOs may make people sick, they are not improving their access to healthy food.

5.  <u>This is important because much of the food supply depends on many animals eating corn.</u>

6.  As with herbicides, this raises the question about whether increasing the corn supply with GMOs has improved access to healthy meat, or made it worse.
