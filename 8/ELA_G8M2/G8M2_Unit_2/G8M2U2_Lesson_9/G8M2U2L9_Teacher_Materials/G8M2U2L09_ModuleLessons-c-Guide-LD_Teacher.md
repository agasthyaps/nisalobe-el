Language Dive Guide: Model Essay:  
“GMOs,” Paragraph 3

W.8.2b, W.8.3c, L.8.1a

(For Teacher Reference)

Sentence: **Although GMOs seem to improve access to healthy food**, questions about the safety of using GMOs still remain. (from paragraph 3 of Model Essay: “GMOs” by EL Education)

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: To help students address the daily learning target  
  (**I can plan the second Proof Paragraph of an informative essay, including a point that is supported by facts and details**) and W.8.2b and W.8.3c by providing students with an opportunity to consider how the first sentence in a Proof Paragraph introduces a new point, using a transition word (**although**) to show the relationship to a previous point. The sentence also helps students to address L.8.1a because it contains an infinitive (**to improve**). Supporting Standards: SL.8.1

- Guiding Question: To help students respond to the guiding question (**What factors influence our access to healthy food?**), this sentence states the potential upside and downside of genetically modified food.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses an infinitive (**to improve**) within a subject complement of the linking verb (**seem**) to make a statement about genetically modified food. Invite students to discuss each chunk briefly, but encourage extended conversation and practice with the focus structure: **Although GMOs seem to improve access to healthy food,**.

- Practice and Transfer: After discussing the focus structure, students practice using it to discuss something in their lives. Students transfer their understanding of the meaning and structure of this sentence when writing their informative essays in preparation for the Desktop Teaching protocol during the End of Unit 2 Assessment.

Throughout the Language Dive

- Refer to the instructions provided in the first three Language Dives of Module 1.

- To focus students’ attention on how infinitive phrases are used within clauses, use blue, red, and yellow markers to code the sentence (noun: blue, verb: red, adjective: yellow). One purpose of this Language Dive is to continue to build students’ capacity in determining the function of verbals in order to meet L.8.1a, which will be assessed in Module 3.

Deconstruct

- Invite students to put their finger by this sentence from the Model Essay: “GMOs” note-catchers: **<u>Although GMOs seem to improve access to healthy food,</u> questions about the safety of using GMOs still remain.**

- Read aloud the sentence twice, then ask students to take turns reading the sentence aloud with their partners.

- Ask:

“What does this sentence mean to you?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“How does this sentence add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

Although GMOs seem to improve access to healthy food,

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **Although GMOs seem to improve access to healthy food,**

- Ask:

“What is the meaning of this chunk?” (There is a reason to believe that genetically modified foods make it easier to get healthy foods.)

“What’s another way to say although?” (even though; despite)

“Can you figure out the subject of this clause?” (GMOs)

- Underline GMOs in blue, and invite students to do the same on their note-catchers. 

“What is the main verb in this clause?” (seem)

- Underline seem in red, and invite students to do the same on their note-catchers. 

- Ask:

“What is the meaning of seem?” (give the impression; suggest; appear)

“What do you notice about the phrase that follows the verb seem?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to recognize that it is an infinitive phrase that begins with the infinitive to improve.)

“Is this infinitive phrase functioning as a noun, an adjective, or an adverb? How do you know?” (Adjective. We know this because it is describing the subject: GMOs. We can test this by replacing the entire infinitive phrase with other adjectives.)

- Underline to improve access to healthy food in yellow, and invite students to do the same on their note-catchers. 

- Explain to or remind students that the verb **seem** is a linking verb like **is** and **become**. The verb **seem** is almost always followed by an adjective because its meaning inherently has to do with description.

- Ask:

“Can you figure out why the writer chose to write seem to improve instead of improve?”  
(The verb seem conveys a sense of uncertainty and suggests that something is still being determined. If the writer had used improve as the main verb, it would indicate that this is a known and proven fact.)

- Note: As time allows, display a version of this clause with **seem to** omitted to help students respond to the question above (**GMOs improve access to healthy food**). For lighter support, invite students to generate the clause for comparison themselves.

“How can you use the verb seem in your own speaking and writing?” (to indicate to the reader or listener that the information to follow is likely but still somewhat unclear or uncertain)

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Display the sentence frame:

> **Eating healthy seems \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**
>
> subject infinitive phrase
>
> (**to** + base form of verb + object = infinitive phrase)
>
> (subject + **seems** + infinitive = statement expressing something that is likely)

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use this frame to talk about eating healthy in your own words with your partners.”

questions about the safety of using GMOs still remain.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **questions about the safety of using GMOs still remain.**

- Ask:

“What does this chunk tell us? What, in the sentence, makes you think so?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to notice that this chunk tells us that there are things we don’t know yet about GMOs. Students might also note that this chunk states the main point that will be explained in the Proof Paragraph that follows.)

“Does this chunk tell us about a pro or a con of GMOs?” (a con; this chunk is telling us GMOs might be unsafe to eat)

- As necessary, invite students to return to the first paragraph of Model Essay: “GMOs” to reread the focus statement.

Although GMOs seem to improve access to healthy food, questions about the safety of using GMOs still remain.

Reconstruct

- Point to and read aloud the entire sentence on display: **<u>Although GMOs seem to improve access to healthy food,</u> questions about the safety of using GMOs still remain.**

- Ask:

“How does the information in this sentence connect to the focus statement of the model essay?” (This sentence restates the first and second points that support the main claim of the essay.)

- As time allows, invite students to color-code the two points in this sentence using Painted Essay<sup>®</sup> color-coding conventions (yellow = Point 1, blue = Point 2).

- Ask:

“What does although tell us about the relationship between the two points?” (that they are in contrast; one is a pro and the other, a con)

“What if we change the order of the two clauses in this sentence?” (The meaning is the same, but it becomes harder to follow the writer’s claim. The original order of the sentence reflects the order in which the writer presents his or her points. Since the previous sentence was about the pros of GMOs, it makes more sense to include this information first, as a way of linking the information to follow in the second Proof Paragraph with the information that preceded it in the first Proof Paragraph.)

- Note: For heavier support, display and choral read the sentence with the order of the two clauses reversed as **Questions about the safety of GMOs still remain although GMOs seem to improve access to healthy food.**

- Ask:

“What other questions can we ask that will help us understand this sentence?” (Reponses will vary.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does this Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

**Although \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

clause restating Point 1 clause restating Point 2

(subject + predicate = clause)

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use this frame to draft the topic sentence for the second Proof Paragraph of an essay that explores the pros and cons of organic food. Restate the following two points in your own words in your sentence:

Point 1: Organic food can benefit people’s health.

Point 2: It costs more to buy organic food.”

- Remind students that posting the chunks in language categories will help them use the language again for future speaking and writing tasks.

- Say, and call on volunteers:

“Now take each chunk, and post it to the appropriate column of the Language Chunk Wall. You can refer to these chunks again as you speak and write.”
