Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.8.3c – Work Time A: Students participate in a Language Dive to explore how transitional phrases can help to show the relationship between ideas in an essay.

- L.8.1a – Work Time A: Students participate in a Language Dive, analyzing a sentence that uses an infinitive to express possibility and purpose and explaining the function of this verbal.

- W.8.2.b – Work Time B: Students plan their Proof Paragraphs 1 and 2, choosing relevant details to develop the topic.

- W.8.4 – Work Time B: Students examine the Proof Paragraphs of a model essay, analyzing how the development, organization, and style are appropriate for the task and purpose.

- W.8.5 – Work Time B: With some guidance and support, students plan Proof Paragraphs 1 and 2 of their essay.

- W.8.5 – Closing and Assessment A: Students develop and strengthen their writing plan with the support of peer feedback.

- SL.8.4 – Closing and Assessment A: Students use appropriate eye contact, adequate volume, and clear pronunciation as they present their Proof Paragraphs plan to a peer for feedback.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become better learners, using their strengths when collaborating with a partner to give and receive feedback on their plans.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Invite students to an optional mini lesson discussing W.8.2c, and provide opportunities for students to explore and try out transition words and phrases in their Proof Paragraphs.

- An optional Mini Language Dive, intended for use after students analyze the model in Work Time B, is available in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- In Closing and Assessment A, students give and receive peer feedback focused on the plan for their Proof Paragraphs and the evidence and details used to explain their thinking (W.8.2b). If time permits, allow more time for peer review focused on common issues students may struggle with.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students analyzed the structure of the model essay using the Painted Essay® template, looking at the introductions of the Model Essay: “GMOs” and the Model Essay: “CSAs.” This lesson continues that work, narrowing in on the Proof Paragraphs of the essay, looking closely at how transitional phrases can help to show the relationship between ideas in an essay during the Language Dive.

Support All Students

- When revisiting the model essay, read it aloud to model strong Proof Paragraphs to provide time for auditory processing. ▲

- Throughout this lesson, students refer to and examine the Model Essay: “GMOs” prior to planning aspects of their own independent research essay. Although not built in as frequently for instruction, students also examine the second model essay, Model Essay: “CSAs.” Use the Model Essay: “CSAs” in large and small group instruction to support students who will need a closer view of this essay as determined by their independent research topic.

- Presenting the model visually, displayed in painted form, could support students who struggle to understand the components of the Painted Essay® structure. ▲

- In Work Times A and B and during the Language Dive, use strategic grouping to form small groups of students who share the same home language, with one or more proficient native English-speaking students added to each group to create a balance and range of similar and diverse perspectives on the structure of the English language. ▲

- For the planning portion of the lesson, allow students a range of tech options for planning/writing and/or recording audio “notes.” Provide different graphic organizers or outlines in a variety of digital and print formats, and/or encourage students to talk through their ideas for their introduction and focus statements before planning. ▲

- Students may have varying levels of familiarity and comfortability with planning for Proof Paragraphs. Be aware of those who may struggle or may need additional support with skill or confidence levels. ▲

- Provide additional practice with restating a focus for ELLs and other students who need further support (selecting the best concluding statement from multiple options; gap fill, etc.). ▲

- Give students the opportunity to plan and edit using an online tool such as http://eled.org/0158. Peer-sharing and critique can also be done this way using track changes.

- To support ELLs, this lesson provides a sequence of tasks that guides students through writing Proof Paragraphs of an essay. In Work Time A, students participate in a Language Dive to analyze the topic sentence of Proof Paragraph 2 of the Model Essay: “GMOs.” Students then analyze the Proof Paragraphs of both model essays and continue to plan their informative essays, working on mapping out their own Proof Paragraphs. A pair-share during Closing and Assessment A offers an opportunity for supportive feedback and learning, as well as oral skills practice.

- ELLs may find it challenging to plan the Proof Paragraphs of their essays. Allowing time for oral processing before writing may help some students gain clarity around their ideas, and collaborative support from peers will help build students’ confidence. Encourage students to refer back to Model Essay: “GMOs” and Model Essay: “CSAs” as needed to remind themselves of the structure and type of content and language that is expected.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.5, 8.I.B.6, and 8.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- Throughout Work Time B, circulate to monitor students’ planning skills on the Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer. If necessary, collect this organizer to provide feedback to students who may need it before the following lesson.

- Throughout Work Time B, frequently review students’ work to ensure they are creating strong plans for their essays that align with the Painted Essay® structure. Use common issues as whole group teaching points.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will use their plans to draft and revise their essays. Following that, students will use the Desktop Teaching protocol to present their research findings.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.8.2f (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **2**, **Lesson** **9**.

- Explain to students that today they will work on creating strong Proof Paragraphs. Prompt students to share their answers to the Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 9. Use **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **2**, **Lesson** **9** (**for** **teacher** **reference**) to clarify any questions or misconceptions.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Language Dive: Model Essay “GMOs,” Paragraph 3 – W.8.2b (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can plan a Proof Paragraph to an informative essay that includes relevant details, examples, and evidence that support my focus statement.”

- Tell students they will now participate in a Language Dive to explore how the first sentence in a Proof Paragraph introduces a new point and how infinitives can function in sentences.

- Read aloud Proof Paragraph 2 of the **Model** **Essay**: “ **GMOs** ” (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Focus students on the sentence:

- Although GMOs seem to improve access to healthy food, questions about the safety of using GMOs still remain.

- Use the **Language** **Dive** **Guide**: **Model** **Essay**: “ **GMOs**,” **Paragraph** **3** (**for** **teacher** **reference**) to guide students through a Language Dive conversation about the sentence. Distribute and display the **Language** **Dive**: **Model** **Essay**: “ **GMOs**,” **Paragraph** **3** **note** - **catcher** and the **Language** **Dive**: **Model** **Essay**: “ **GMOs**,” **Paragraph** **3** **sentence** **chunk** **strips**. Refer to the **Language** **Dive**: **Model** **Essay**: “ **GMOs**,” **Paragraph** **3** **note** - **catcher** (**for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- After Work Time A, invite students to participate in a Mini Language Dive with the topic sentence from Proof Paragraph 2 of Model Essay: “CSAs” to help highlight the differences between the content in the two model essays that students work with. The sentence also helps students to address L.8.1a, as it contains a gerund.

Work Time

B. Analyze Model and Plan Proof Paragraphs – W.8.5 (25 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can plan Proof Paragraphs for an informative essay that include relevant details, examples, and evidence that support my focus statement.”

- Display and invite students to retrieve their **Informative** **Writing** **checklist**. Point out the following characteristics:

- “W.8.2b: I use relevant facts, definitions, details, quotations, and examples to explain my thinking.”

- Tell students that as they plan their Proof Paragraph 1, they should remember to support their ideas with evidence from the texts they read and listened to throughout their independent research study in Lessons 1–5. Remind students that the primary focus of instruction will be on the **Model** **Essay**: “ **GMOs**.”

- Prompt partners to read aloud Proof Paragraph 1 from the Model Essay: “GMOs.” Invite students to Turn and Talk about the model:

“What is the first point that supports the focus statement of the Model Essay: ‘GMOs’?” (There are many cases in which GMOs seem to improve Americans’ access to healthy foods.)

- Direct students to retrieve their **Informative** **Writing** **Plan** **graphic** **organizer**. Invite students to Turn and Talk about their own essays:

“What is the first point that supports the focus statement you planned in your Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer?” (Responses will vary, but students should read and reference the first point of their focus statement they identified in the previous lesson.)

- Have students write the first point that supports their focus statement in the spot on their Informative Writing Plan graphic organizers under Proof Paragraph 1.

- Direct partners to refer to their assigned model essay, and ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What evidence is used in your Model Essay to support and explain the main point in Proof Paragraph 1?” (GMOs: “A review of 6,000 studies between 1996 and 2016 showed that GMOs had increased production of corn by up to 25 percent \[Dovey, 2018\].” and “GMO canola oil has fewer trans fats than regular canola oil \[bestfoods.org\]. Canola oil is used to make many other foods. This means that GMOs may actually increase people’s access to healthy food. Finally, the new genes in some corn make it harder for harmful insects to survive. This means that farmers who grow the GMO corn have been able to use fewer pesticides \[Brody, 2018\].” CSAs: “Food that comes from far away is older. It has traveled many miles, and has probably sat in a warehouse, before you buy it \[Grobinger, University of Vermont, 2010\].” and “Once produce is harvested, its optimal nutritional value decreases, specifically in vitamins A, B, C and E” \[Cleveland Clinic, 2016\].” and “Besides the benefit of being so fresh, food from a CSA gives the consumer many choices \[Cleveland Clinic, 2016\].” and “Depending on the time in the growing season, the weekly CSA box contains many different types of fruits and vegetables. In early summer, the customer may get berries, lettuce, and asparagus. Later, foods could include potatoes, watermelon, and apples. The local CSA also gives out information and recipes about how to use this variety of fresh food \[Cleveland Clinic, 2016\].”)

- Help students notice that the model essay includes evidence in Proof Paragraph 1 that directly supports the first point of the focus statement.

- Focus students on their **Access** **to** **Healthy** **Food**: **Independent** **Research** **note** - **catcher**.

- Turn and Talk:

“How will your Access to Healthy Food: Independent Research note-catcher help you in planning your Proof Paragraphs?” (The evidence for each Proof Paragraph will come from the research recorded on the note-catcher.)

“What evidence will you use in Proof Paragraph 1 to support and explain your point?” (Responses will vary, but students should locate and reference evidence gathered in previous lessons.)

- Inform students that another important aspect of a Proof Paragraph is the elaboration of the evidence. This often directly follows the evidence and acts to further support the writer’s focus. Point students to the first piece of evidence in the Model Essay: “GMOs” located in Proof Paragraph 1. Read it aloud, directing students to follow along silently, starting with “First, GMO corn . . . ” and ending with “ . . . increased production of corn by up to 25 percent.”

- Next, read the elaboration aloud, starting with “This is important because . . . ” and ending with “ . . . more people have dependable access to food.”

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What purpose does this elaboration section serve in the Proof Paragraph?” (It further explains the evidence and/or relates the evidence to the focus of the essay.)

- Direct partners to underline the additional elaboration sections in Proof Paragraph 1 of the Model Essay: “GMOs.”

- Using total participation techniques such as **equity** **sticks**, call on students to share out the additional elaboration sections they found. (“Canola oil is used to make many other foods. This means that GMOs may actually increase people’s access to healthy food.” and “This means that farmers who grow the GMO corn have been able to use fewer pesticides.”)

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“Why is it necessary to elaborate on the evidence in a Proof Paragraph?” (Without elaborating on the evidence, readers might not fully understand the evidence or might not be able to connect the evidence back to the focus statement. The elaboration clarifies the writer’s message.)

- Stress the importance of the elaboration section, and explain that orally rehearsing how explaining the evidence included, and how the evidence connects to the focus statement, is a critical aspect of writing a successful informative essay. Invite students to work with a partner, once they have compiled evidence, to orally rehearse their elaboration.

- Display **Model** **Essay**: “ **CSAs**,” and direct students to retrieve their copies. Refer to **Model** **Essay**: “ **CSAs** ” (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**), as needed, to support students. Have them read Proof Paragraph 1 silently. Cold Call on students to discuss:

“How is this Proof Paragraph 1 similar to Proof Paragraph 1 in Model Essay: ‘GMOs’?” (It also includes evidence that supports the first point and elaboration that ties the evidence to the focus.)

- Help students notice that Proof Paragraph 1 in both model essays are similar. The evidence in Proof Paragraph 1 of each essay directly supports the first point of the focus statement, and elaboration sentences help the reader connect back to the focus.

- Explain to students that they will now examine the second Proof Paragraphs of the model essays. Remind students that some of them have topics that describe only one impact (either an increase or decrease), and some have topics that describe both an increase and a decrease of access to healthy food. The primary place where this is evident is in Proof Paragraph 2 of each essay. Have students identify the model essay that is most applicable to their own independent research. Tell students they will use this model essay to guide the rest of the analysis they do as they plan their informative essay.

- Direct students to find a partner who is using the same model essay, and prompt partners to read Proof Paragraph 2 aloud to one another. Lead students through the following series of questions using the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol:

“What is the second point that supports the focus statement of your model essay?” (Model Essay: “GMOs” — “Although GMOs seem to improve access to healthy food, questions about the safety of using GMOs still remain.” Model Essay: “CSAs” — “In addition to increasing access to healthy food through freshness and variety, CSAs increase access to healthy food by having a positive impact on the use of fossil fuels.”)

“What point will you be addressing in your Proof Paragraph 2?” (Responses will vary depending on research topic.)

- Direct partners to bracket the evidence used in Proof Paragraph 2 of their model essay. Prompt partners to join another pair focusing on the same model essay, forming quads, and comparing the evidence and elaboration they identified in their model essay. Prompt quads to discuss the following question:

“How is Proof Paragraph 2 in each model similar to and/or different from Proof Paragraph 1 in each essay?” (They are similar in structure and organization. However, they are different in content.)

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share about their own essays:

“What evidence will you use in your essay in Proof Paragraph 2 to support and explain your thinking? Read that evidence aloud to your partner.” (Responses will vary, but should reference evidence gathered in previous lessons.)

“What elaboration sentences will tie your evidence together and support your point in a clear way for your reader?” (Responses will vary.)

- Tell students they are now ready to plan the Proof Paragraphs of their own independent research essays, including the evidence and elaboration. Remind students to use the model essay that is most applicable to their own independent research.

- Prompt students to refer to their Access to Healthy Food: Independent Research note-catcher as a guide to select and add evidence that supports their first and second points of their focus to their Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer.

- Circulate to support students as they plan. If necessary, prompt by asking questions such as:

“How does this increase (or decrease) access to healthy food? What impact did it have?”

“What is the strongest evidence that supports this point?”

“How will you elaborate on the evidence you plan to use? In your own words, how does the evidence you chose help to support your point?”

- Invite students to retrieve the following materials:

- Access to Healthy Food: Independent Research note-catcher

- Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer

- Informative Writing checklist

- **Painted** **Essay** ® **template**

- Tell students they are now ready to plan Proof Paragraph 2 of their own independent research essays, including the evidence and elaboration. Prompt students to refer to their Access to Healthy Food: Independent Research note-catcher as a guide to select and add evidence that supports their second point of their focus to their Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer.

- Circulate to support students as they plan. Refer to the Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer (example for teacher reference) as needed. As students work, provide opportunities for them to orally rehearse how they will connect and explain their evidence with a partner as a way to plan effective elaboration.

- If necessary, prompt by asking questions such as:

“How does your topic decrease (or increase) access to healthy food?”

“What is the strongest evidence that supports this point?”

“How will you elaborate on the evidence you plan to use?”

- Prompt students to Think-Pair-Share:

“Which evidence in your plan will most effectively support and explain your thinking?” (Responses will vary.)

- Using total participation techniques, such as equity sticks, call on students to share out with the class about their evidence and how it will further support and explain their thinking.

- Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target, using a checking for understanding technique—for example, showing thumbs-up or traffic light signal cards. Scan student responses, and make a note of students who might need support. Check in with them moving forward.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- As in Lesson 8, in Work Time B, host a think-aloud. In a small group of students who need the heaviest support, display Proof Paragraph 2 of the model essay. Annotate aloud, in real-time, the writer’s thinking process. Invite students to note this thinking and recall the questions that were asked aloud.

Closing and Assessment

A. Pair-Share: Proof Paragraph Feedback – SL.8.4 (5 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can present my Proof Paragraphs plan to a partner, using appropriate eye contact and adequate volume.”

- Refer to the displayed **Informative** **Writing** **checklist**. Focus students on the criterion:

- “W.8.2b: I use relevant facts, definitions, details, quotations, and examples to explain my thinking.”

- Invite students to mark or highlight this criterion on their checklist, because that will be the focus of their collaboration.

- Move students into pairs, and invite them to Turn and Talk:

“What does this criterion mean in your own words?”

- Prompt students to present the plans for their Proof Paragraphs aloud to their partner, focusing on appropriate eye contact and adequate volume and pronunciation.

- After students present, ask them to provide feedback to their partner based on the criterion identified from the Informative Writing checklist.

- Invite student pairs to answer the following question:

“How does your partner plan on using relevant facts, details, quotes or examples to explain his or her thinking?”

- Circle and monitor the discussions to ensure each student shares feedback with their partner on their restated focus statement and further reflection on the topic.

- Invite students to make notes on their planners based on the feedback they receive.

- Prompt students to give feedback to one another on their use of eye contact and appropriate volume and pronunciation.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson in their work to be respectful partners, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- During the pair-share, to maximize feedback, have students work in small groups of three or four, rather than pairs, to provide an opportunity for students to receive feedback from more than one person. This will also give students the opportunity to see multiple examples of others’ writing, which will help to inform students’ own work, as well.

For Heavier Support

- While students interact to provide peer feedback, jot down examples of effective communication. Also jot down one or two common language errors (pervasive, stigmatizing, critical). Share each of these with the class, allowing students to take pride in the effective communication and correct the errors. (It’s not necessary to identify who communicated well or who made errors. However, pull the student aside to make it clear.) This will help students as they prepare for the desktop teaching activity in the End of Unit 2 Assessment, Part II.

Homework

A. Revise Informative Essay Plan

- Students use the feedback from Closing and Assessment A to revise their own independent research essay plan.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent** **reading** **journal**.
