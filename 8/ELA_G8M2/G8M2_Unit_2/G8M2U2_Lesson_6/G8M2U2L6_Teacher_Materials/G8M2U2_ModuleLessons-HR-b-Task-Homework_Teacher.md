**Model Essay: “GMOs”**

**Prompt:** How do GMOs influence our access to healthy food?

Access to healthy food is a basic human need. It can be complicated. In America today, many factors influence our access to healthy food. Do we have enough money to buy healthy food? Is healthy food available where we live? Can we find food that is grown in good soil? Can we find food that is free of chemicals that might cause harm? Can our soil and water contribute to growing healthy food? Can we find healthy food from healthy animals? All of these are factors we consider when we think about access to healthy food. Today, some foods are the result of genetic changes that have been made by scientists. These are known as GMOs, or genetically modified organisms. GMOs are made by splicing new genes from one plant into another. This changes the plant in some way. For example, a plant scientist might want to find a way to grow strawberries that are resistant to frost. This would allow the growing season to last longer. She might take the “frost gene” from parsley (which can take a frost) and splice it into strawberry plants. The new strawberry plants would be a form of GMO (Erdosh and Lusted, 17).  
<u>GMOs influence our access to healthy food. In many ways, GMOs seem to improve access to healthy foods. In other ways, the safety and benefit of GMOs are still being questioned.</u>

There are many cases in which GMOs seem to improve Americans’ access to healthy foods. First, GMO corn has increased the amount of corn available. A review of 6,000 studies between 1996 and 2016 showed that GMOs had increased production of corn by up to 25 percent (Dovey, 2018). This is important because much of the food supply depends on many animals eating corn. Also, corn is used in many other food products. This means that increasing the amount of corn means more people have dependable access to food. Some people have been worried that there is a nutritional difference between GMO and non-GMO food. However, there seems to be no difference. In fact, GMO canola oil has fewer trans fats than regular canola oil (bestfoods.org). Canola oil is used to make many other foods. This means that GMOs may actually increase people’s access to healthy food. Finally, the new genes in some corn make it harder for harmful insects to survive. This means that farmers who grow the GMO corn have been able to use fewer pesticides (Brody, 2018). In the long run, GMOs can increase people’s access to healthy food because there is more food and fewer pesticides in the soil, water, and the food itself.

Although GMOs seem to improve access to healthy food, questions about the safety of using GMOs still remain. Some of these questions have to do with long-term effects on consumers’ health. For example, the *New York Times* reported in 2018 about a GMO called EnlistDuo. It is supposed to make crop plants more resistant to weed-killing chemicals. However, it has been found to increase the prevalence of a cancer called non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (Brody, 2018). Others point out that GMOs have not been in use long enough for us to be certain they are safe (Brody, 2018). If GMOs may make people sick, they are not improving their access to healthy food. Another question is about the health of the soil that GMO crops are growing in. Some studies show that it is true that pesticide use has fallen by a third with GMOs. This certainly makes for healthier soil. However, the same studies show that herbicide use (weed killers) has increased by 21 percent with GMO crops (Hakim, 2016). This raises the question about whether GMOs are really good for the soil and the supply of healthy food. Finally, the fact that GMOs have improved corn yields may not have an entirely helpful impact. As Michael Pollan points out in *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, cattle in feedlots are fed corn because it fattens them quickly. However, corn is not their natural food. He explains, “Their corn-based diet . . . makes them ill” (Pollan, 70). As a result, the cattle have to be given antibiotics, which causes other problems. As with herbicides, this raises the question about whether increasing the corn supply with GMOs has improved access to healthy meat, or made it worse. The Non-GMO Project explains that “in the absence of credible independent long-term feeding studies, the safety of GMOs is unknown. Increasingly, citizens are taking matters into their own hands and choosing to opt out of the GMO experiment.” Over time, it is possible that GMOs may prove to decrease people’s access to healthy food because they may be dangerous to consume or may have a negative impact on our food industry.

Overall, there are indications that GMOs improve people’s access to healthy food. At the same time, many questions and potential harms to health remain. It seems sensible to very closely study and monitor the effects of GMOs on human health, animal health, and soil and water. Having reliable access to healthy food, both short and long term, is too important to leave to chance.
