**Choose and Use Credible Internet Sources**

You can determine whether an internet source is reliable by identifying the publisher, author, bias, accuracy, and timeliness of the source.

- **Publisher:** A reliable internet source is usually published by the government (.gov), educational institutions (.edu), or nonprofit organizations (.org). Sometimes internet sources published by commercial organizations (.com) are reliable, but not always.

- **Credibility:** A credible internet source should be visually appealing, clean, and uncluttered, with links that work. It should not have many errors in spelling or grammar.

- **Author:** You can tell whether an internet source is accurate by looking at who wrote it and checking the writer’s credentials.

- **Bias:** An internet source that presents both sides of an argument, or does not have any bias and that presents facts. Please note that a source may be credible and biased, in which case it is important to research to find other perspectives to ensure deep and accurate understanding.

- **Accuracy:** An internet source that contains accurate facts. If the information is contradictory to other sources, it could be factually incorrect.

- **Timeliness:** An internet source that is reliable is timely; it does not have out-of-date information.

**Quote Accurately**

- Copy the exact words that it says in the text.

- Give the page number that the quote is from.

- Use quotation marks (“quote”) to show the words that have come word for word from the text.

- If using “he said,” “she said,” or “it says,” for example, put a comma before the quotation marks (On page 30 Miguel said, “Quote.”).
