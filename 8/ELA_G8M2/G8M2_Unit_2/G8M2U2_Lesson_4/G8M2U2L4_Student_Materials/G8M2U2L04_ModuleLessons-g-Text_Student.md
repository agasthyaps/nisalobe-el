**Organic Food**

By Leslie A. Duram

Organic food: fresh or processed food produced by organic farming methods. Organic food is grown without the use of synthetic chemicals, such as human-made pesticides and fertilizers. It also does not contain genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Organic foods include fresh produce, meats, and dairy products. It also includes processed foods such as crackers, drinks, and frozen meals. The market for organic food has grown significantly since the late 20th century. It has become a multibillion dollar industry with distinct production, processing, distribution, and retail systems.

**Policy**

Organic food production began as an alternative farming method outside the mainstream. However, it eventually became divided between two distinct paths. The first is small-scale farms that may not be formally certified organic. They depend on informed consumers who seek out local, fresh, organically grown foods. The second is large-scale certified organic food (fresh and processed). It is typically transported large distances and is distributed through typical grocery store chains. If consumers know their local farmer and trust the farmer’s production methods, they may not demand a certification label. On the other hand, organic food produced far away and shipped is more likely to require a certification label to promote consumer trust and to prevent fraud. This exemplifies how national certification regulations are most beneficial.

**Environment**

The overall impacts of organic agriculture are beneficial to the environment. Certified organic production methods prohibit the use of man made fertilizers and pesticides. This reduces chemical runoff and the pollution of soils and watersheds. Smaller-scale organic farming often is associated with significant environmental benefits. This is because of the use of on-farm inputs, such as fertilizers made from compost created on-site. By comparison, large-scale organic farms often require inputs generated off-site and may not use integrated farming methods. These operations may buy specific allowable inputs, such as fish emulsion or blood meal to use as fertilizer rather than working within the farm to increase soil fertility. This decrease in synthetic chemical use does benefit the environment compared with industrial agriculture. However, these methods may not promote long-term sustainability, since off-farm inputs usually require greater fossil fuel use than on-farm inputs.

**Society**

Social concerns related to organic food include higher costs to consumers and geographic variations in demand. Organic food usually is more expensive for consumers than conventionally produced food. This is because of its more labour-intensive methods, the costs of certification, and the decreased reliance on chemicals to prop up crop yields. This often translates into unequal access to organic food. Research indicates that greater wealth and education levels are connected with organic food purchases. Further, there are trends in some lower-income countries to produce certified organic crops solely for export to wealthier countries. This sometimes generates a situation in which the farmers themselves cannot afford to buy the organic foods they are producing. This strategy may bring economic gain in the short term. However, it is a concern when farmers are forced out of producing food crops that feed their local communities, thus increasing food insecurity.

Certified organic agriculture has also become a big business in many places. Larger farming operations play a key role in national and global certified organic food markets. Big food-processing companies often buy from a single farming operation that produces organic crops on thousands of acres. They do this instead of buying from many smaller farms that grow on smaller acreages. This practice effectively limits the participation of smaller farmers in these markets. There also is disparity among farmers, since the organic certification process can be prohibitively expensive to some smaller-scale farmers. Certification subsidies exist in some places. However, such farmers often opt to sell directly to consumers at farmers’ markets. They may decide to forgo organic certification altogether.

Overall, organic food has grown in popularity. Consumers have increasingly sought and purchased foods that they perceive as being healthier and grown in ways that benefit the environment. Consumers typically buy organic food in order to reduce their exposure to pesticide residues and GMOs. Further, some research shows that organically produced crops have higher nutritional content than comparable nonorganic crops. Some people even find organic foods to be tastier. The question remains, however, whether organic food shipped in from across the globe is truly a sustainable method of food production. Certainly organically produced food from a local farmer who employs an integrated whole-farm approach is fairly environmentally sustainable. However, the economic sustainability of such an endeavour can be challenging. Although humans must decrease their reliance on fossil fuels to combat climate change, many organic policies do little to address the issue of sustainability. They focus instead on the strict list of prohibited substances, rather than a comprehensive long-term view of farming and food.
