**Prompt:** How do food deserts influence our access to healthy food?

**Food Desert**

by Kara Rogers

**Food desert: an impoverished area where residents lack access to healthy foods**. Food deserts may exist in rural or urban areas. They are associated with complex geographic and socioeconomic factors. They are also associated with poor diet and health disorders such as obesity. The term **food desert** was introduced in the early 1990s in western Scotland. It was used to describe the poor access to nutritious foods experienced by residents of a public housing development.

**Defining Food Deserts**

Food deserts are compared to physical desert regions. This is because the search for and acquisition of nutritious foods is not easily accomplished in either environment. Food deserts often are not easily traveled across, particularly by people without cars who rely on public transportation. If nutritious foods are available, they often are unaffordable. There have been many investigations conducted in the United Kingdom and the United States, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. But the criteria that define food deserts and their boundaries and the reasons for their existence are not fully understood.

**Socioeconomic Factors and Food Deserts**

There are uncertainties about the origins of food deserts. However, research suggests that economic factors, such as supply and demand, impact food deserts. Also, urban planning, which serves to connect consumers to food retailers and transportation services, is at play. These factors interact in ways that are complex. For example, the interaction of supply and demand generally determines which food products are available and the price of those products. Consumer demand is heavily influenced by personal preference. And personal preference is influenced by individual behaviour and socioeconomic factors. Therefore, in a low-income area there may exist not only a lack of nutritious foods but also a general lack of education about healthy food choices. Residents may unknowingly choose unhealthy foods. This continues the demand for those food products and prolongs their availability.

**Food Deserts and Health Disparities**

The study of food deserts has drawn attention to disparities in food availability, diet, and health. These differences are associated with income level, ethnicity, and local food environment. For example, in several US states, including Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, and North Carolina, wealthy neighbourhoods were found to have more supermarkets than poor neighbourhoods. The same was true for mostly white versus mostly black neighbourhoods. Other studies have revealed that some urban and rural food deserts have a relatively high number of convenience stores. They also have few or no supermarkets. While convenience stores sell food products, they generally offer high-calorie foods that are low in vital nutrients at relatively high prices. They also do not offer the wide selection of healthy foods, such as vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, that can be found in supermarkets. Overweight and obesity, as well as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and kidney failure, tend to be more prevalent in areas with a greater number of convenience stores relative to supermarkets.

**Improving Access to Healthy Foods**

Some countries where food deserts have been determined to exist have introduced measures to improve access to healthy foods. These measures include finding ways to promote healthy food retailers in food deserts. They also try to connect consumers to outlets where fresh vegetables and fruits and other healthy foods are available at reasonable cost. This may be accomplished through farmers’ markets, exposure to healthy foods in schools, urban garden and agriculture projects. It can even be accomplished through online supermarkets that offer healthy foods for order over the Internet and delivery to accessible locations.

One of the first countries to attempt to make inroads into the problem of food deserts was the United Kingdom. However, its Food Poverty (Eradication) Bill of 2001 failed passage. The United States also took steps to improve access to healthy foods. They introduced the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008. This was followed by an evaluation of the prevalence of food deserts in the country. In 2010 US Pres. Barack Obama proposed the Healthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI). This encouraged retailers to bring healthy foods to impoverished urban and rural communities. A large share of subsequent funding for HFFI went to community-development financial institutions for lending to food retailers in food deserts.
