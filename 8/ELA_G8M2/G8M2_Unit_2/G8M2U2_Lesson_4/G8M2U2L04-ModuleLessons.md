Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.8.7 – Opening A: In the entrance ticket, students review how they generated and used additional related focus questions as they conducted research on GMOs in previous lessons.

- W.8.7 – Work Time B: Students work in groups to read texts about factors that influence our access to healthy food.

- W.8.8 – Work Time B: Each group of students shares the information in their assigned article with the class using a Jigsaw protocol. As students listen to each group, they jot down additional related focus questions each group can use in their research.

- W.8.7 – Closing and Assessment A: Students share possible additional related focus questions students may use to guide their research.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Students may read all four articles and choose which case study they want to research.

- Students may begin to conduct internet research on their case study and gather their research findings in their note-catcher.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students worked in pairs to conduct research on the influence of GMOs on our access to healthy food. This lesson builds upon that work by introducing students to a new case study that they research independently.

Support All Students

- For students who need support with reading and taking notes within the allotted time in Work Time B, assign this group of students the high-fructose corn syrup reading in *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*. Students are already familiar with the text, and it contains less unfamiliar vocabulary than the research texts.

- Note there is a differentiated version of the Access to Healthy Food: Independent Research note-catcher used in Work Time A in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- In Work Time B, provide choice in how to carry out the reading portion of the lesson: some students may prefer to read independently and silently, while others (especially ELLs) may wish to read aloud in groups. Still others may wish to read silently for a few pages and then process with a group. This format of choice could potentially be built into the reading time within each lesson. ▲

- In Work Time B, some of the text choices have a high level of Lexile® and may be complex for students. ELLs and other students who are not reading at or above grade level should receive additional support. Provide annotated texts, a glossary of terms, or, for the heaviest support, texts translated into home languages for students to use alongside the English-language versions. ▲

- In Work Time B, students may need additional support with collaborating with their peers. Some students may struggle to share their ideas in their groups. Predetermine grouping to place struggling students in groups with the most peer support. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson provides clear instructions for carrying out independent research, autonomy in selecting research topics, and collaborative work in understanding new texts. Students are introduced to three new case-study topics and work together to navigate their content. By the end of the lesson, students will have narrowed down a preference in articles; this choice of which case study to focus on is especially important for ELLs, as it is essential that they work with a text and subtopic that they feel they can readily understand and analyze.

- ELLs may find it challenging to understand the independent research prompt. In order for ELLs to succeed in the series of tasks in this lesson and the ones ahead, it is imperative they understand the topic choices, the purpose of the independent research project, and the prompt they are being asked to address. Lead small group discussions, and get written input to ensure that students are well oriented to this information before introducing them to case-study texts in Work Time B.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6 and 8.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Access to Healthy Food: Independent Research note-catchers to ensure they understand the influence that pesticides, food deserts, high-fructose corn syrup, or organic foods have on our access to healthy food.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will independently research their case study. Students will cite and analyze these research findings in an informative essay in upcoming lessons.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Ensure there is a copy of Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 4 at each student’s workspace.

- Review the Access to Healthy Food: Independent Research note-catcher (example for teacher reference) to see what students are working toward in this lesson.

- Review the directions for the Jigsaw protocol that was introduced in Module 2, Unit 1, Lesson 6, Work Time B.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous modules to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.8.7 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **2**, **Lesson** **4**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Introduce Case Study Research Project – W.8.7 (5 minutes)

- Remind students that they researched how GMOs influence our access to healthy food in previous lessons. In this lesson, they will research another topic that influences our access to healthy food. Students will be assigned one of four case studies, on pesticides, high-fructose corn syrup, food deserts, or organic foods. Tell students that they will work in a small group to read a text about one of these topics and identify the influence on our access to healthy food. They will conduct independent research on their case study in the next lesson, then use their research findings to write an informative essay about their topic.

- Distribute and display the **Access** **to** **Healthy** **Food**: **Independent** **Research** **note** - **catcher**. For ELLs and students who require additional support, the **Access** **to** **Healthy** **Food**: **Independent** **Research** **note** - **catcher** ▲ can be used to help guide students’ thinking with preselected articles for each topic.

- Read the directions aloud. Explain that this note-catcher is the same as the one that students used to research GMOs, and they will use this to cite evidence from their research that supports how their food topic increases and decreases our access to healthy food.

- Display the **Researcher’s** **Toolbox** handout, and instruct students to retrieve their copies. Ask a volunteer to read aloud the “Quote Accurately” section to review how to cite evidence in a text. Also, review how to paraphrase information to prepare students for the jigsaw in Work Time B.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time A, invite students who need heavier support to use the Access to Healthy Food: Independent Research note-catcher ▲. This resource includes prefilled information about sources for pesticides to help students navigate the analysis required.

Work Time

B. Jigsaw Activity – W.8.8 (30 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can conduct research to answer a question about factors that influence our access to healthy food.”

- Explain to students that scientists often present their ideas at conferences to give the science community and the public information about their research. Tell students that they will pretend to be scientists at a conference who have been selected to share their research to inform the public about access to healthy food. In the form of a jigsaw, they will read and analyze a text to become emerging experts on the topic, and present their findings to their audience. Remind students that they used the Jigsaw protocol in the previous unit to analyze paragraph structures in *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*.

- Organize students into four groups: Group A, Group B, Group C, and Group D.

- Focus students on the **Work** **to** **Become** **Effective** **Learners** **anchor** **chart**. Remind students that it says at the top that effective learners are people who develop the mindsets and skills for success in college, career, and life.

- Ask a volunteer to read aloud the habit of character: “I collaborate. This means I can work well with others to accomplish a task or goal.”

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share to review the following questions:

“What does collaboration look like? What might you see when people are collaborating?” (See Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart \[example for teacher reference\].)

“What does collaboration sound like? What might you hear when people are collaborating?” (See Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart \[example for teacher reference\].)

- Explain that this activity requires everyone in the class to collaborate in order to be successful.

- Distribute **Research** **Text**: “ **The** **Advantages** **and** **Disadvantages** **of** **Pesticides** ” to Group A, **Research** **Text**: “ **Food** **Desert** ” to Group B, and **Research** **Text**: “ **Organic** **Food** ” to Group C. Instruct Group D to read pages 94–96 and 121–122 of ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma***, beginning with “There’s more corn in the meal . . . ,” and ending with “ . . . field of corn and soybeans,” to analyze the subject of high-fructose corn syrup.

- Instruct students to read the text assigned to their group. Students may read independently, in pairs, or take turns reading aloud as a group. Give students several minutes to read.

- Refocus the whole class.

- Focus students’ attention to the top section of the Access to Healthy Food: Independent Research note-catcher. Instruct students to write the central research question they will answer in their research. The research question should mirror the GMO research question from the previous lessons of this unit (i.e., How do\[es\] \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ influence our access to healthy food?).

- Remind students that the central research question has been refined, so they will answer the question by identifying how their topic increases our access to healthy food in the first chart in their note-catcher, and how it decreases our access to healthy food in the second chart.

- Focus students’ attention on the additional related focused questions and read them aloud.

- Instruct students to fill in the blanks with the name of their case study. Explain to students that these questions are similar to the additional related focus questions they used in their GMO research and that they will begin using these questions to guide their research and generate additional questions as they conduct their research independently.

- Tell students to leave the section for search terms blank for now.

- Instruct each group to work independently, in pairs, or as a whole group to complete the two charts in their note-catcher, citing evidence from the text that supports how their food topic both increases and decreases our access to healthy food. Explain to students that they may not find evidence that supports both increases and decreases of their topic’s influence on our access to healthy food (e.g., food deserts, high-fructose corn syrup).

- Circulate as students gather their evidence, and support students who may struggle with identifying evidence that answers the research question. Refer to the **Access** **to** **Healthy** **Food**: **Independent** **Research** **note** - **catcher** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Refocus the whole class.

- Instruct each group to select scribes to record two rows from their chart(s) on **chart** **paper** to present to the class, and a spokesperson to share the group’s ideas with the class. Give students one minute to assign the scribe and spokesperson roles.

- Instruct students to work in their groups to identify two of the strongest quotes and/or paraphrases from their text that they recorded in their note-catcher, and copy the evidence, explanation of evidence, citation, and explanation of credibility on their chart paper. As students share ideas in the group, the scribes will record their responses on chart paper. Give students at least 5 minutes to complete their chart paper.

- Circulate as students work in their groups to ensure they are on track, and support struggling students.

- Refocus the whole class.

- Display the Access to Healthy Food: Independent Research note-catcher.

- Invite Group A’s spokesperson to display their group’s chart paper and share the evidence they found that supports their research topic. As Group A’s spokesperson shares, instruct students in groups B, C, and D to jot down questions they have about Group A’s topic that they can use as additional related focus questions to guide their research. Repeat this process with Group B, Group C, and Group D. Circulate as each group shares to ensure the students who are listening are jotting down potential additional related focus questions for the group that is sharing.

For Lighter Support

- At the beginning of Work Time B, in preparation for reading the research texts, help students recall strategies for reading unfamiliar texts. Examples:

- Chunk the text into manageable amounts, e.g., sentences or paragraphs.

- Circle unfamiliar words.

- Use context or a dictionary to define unfamiliar words.

- Annotate unfamiliar words with synonyms.

- Underline important people, places, and things.

- Read aloud.

- Read repeatedly.

- Silently paraphrase the chunks.

- Summarize what you read for someone else, perhaps first in your home language.

- In Work Time B, as an alternative to using the Access to Healthy Food: Independent Research note-catcher ▲, distribute additional copies of the Access to Healthy Food: Independent Research note-catcher with the prefilled information for each category on cut strips of paper to create a tactile matching activity. Students can work in groups to glue the appropriate information to each row in the note-catcher based on what they learn from their classmates during the jigsaw activity and then transfer the information to their individual note-catchers, which will add further reinforcement and opportunities for additional processing.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time B, for ELLs who require heavier support, provide a summary of each research topic in students’ home languages prior to reading the texts. This will orient ELLs to the content they will encounter, helping them to balance the cognitive and linguistic demands of navigating new information.

Closing and Assessment

A. Whole-Class Share – W.8.7 (5 minutes)

- Refocus the whole group.

- Turn and Talk:

“What are some potential additional related focus questions Group A can use as they conduct their research on pesticides?” (Responses will vary, but may include: what is the sustainability of pesticides?)

“What are some potential additional related focus questions Group B can use as they conduct their research on food deserts?” (Responses will vary, but may include: what are some ways people in food deserts can access healthy food?)

“What are some potential additional related focus questions Group C can use as they conduct their research on organic foods?” (Answers will vary, but may include: what is the sustainability of organic foods?)

“What are some potential additional related focus questions Group D can use as they conduct their research on high-fructose corn syrup?” (Responses will vary, but may include: what are some ways people can access healthy alternatives to high-fructose corn syrup?)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the learning target.

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent** **reading** **journal**.
