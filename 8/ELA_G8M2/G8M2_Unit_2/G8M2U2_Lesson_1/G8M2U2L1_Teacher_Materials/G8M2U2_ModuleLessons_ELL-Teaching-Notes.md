English Language Learners: Grade 8: Module 2: Unit 2: Teaching Notes

Research Access to Healthy Food

Teaching Notes for Unit 2

Prioritize Lessons for Classrooms with Many English Language Learners

In this unit, students spend time developing research skills and writing informative essays in preparation for the End of Unit 2 Assessment, in which students present research findings in a desktop teaching activity. To prepare students for this task, prioritize Lessons 8 and 9. In these lessons, students analyze model informative essays. For ELLs, these examples help to clarify how writers use research to inform others about a topic. Help students to consider the relevance of evidence included in these essays, and to notice how the writers present and analyze the information. This will help students to carry this out in their own work. Additionally, provide ample time for students to read and discuss examples of paraphrasing and quoting, and support students in practicing these skills regularly.

Language Dives

In Lessons 8 and 9, students participate in Language Dives. The Language Dive in Lesson 8 gives students the opportunity to analyze the focus statement of a model essay. This Dive introduces students to passive voice (L.8.1b, L.8.3a). In the practice portion of this Language Dive, students begin drafting the focus statement of their own essay. The Language Dive in Lesson 9 is intended to help students better understand the way in which the topic sentence of a Proof Paragraph connects to the focus statement and main claim of the essay. This Language Dive also includes work with L.8.1a and infinitive phrases. In assessments in Module 3, students will explain the function of verbals (gerunds, infinitives, participles). Work in this Language Dive helps students to begin thinking about how infinitive phrases are used.

Students continue to routinely participate in Language Dives in Modules 2–4. See the Module 1 Teacher’s Guide for English Language Learners for details about Language Dives and why they are critical for ELLs.

Note that the Language Dive Guides have been condensed in Module 2, as a way to reduce the amount of reading expected of teachers. Refer to the general best practices laid out in the Module 1 Language Dive Guides.

Language Chunk Wall

Beginning in Module 2 and going forward, create a “Language Chunk Wall” to extend students’ capacity to use Language Dive structures. The Language Chunk Wall is an area in the classroom where students can display and categorize the academic phrases discussed in each Language Dive. At the end of each Language Dive, students are invited to place the Language Dive sentence chunk strips on the Language Chunk Wall into corresponding categories, such as “Nouns and Noun Phrases” or “Linking Language.” See each Language Dive for suggested categories. Color-code each category for additional support. Examples: blue for nouns and subjects; purple for pronouns; red for predicates and verbs; yellow for adjectives; and green for adverbs, prepositions, and conjunctions. Students can then refer to the wall during subsequent speaking and writing tasks.

Mini Language Dives

Students have an opportunity to participate in Mini Language Dives beginning in Module 2, Unit 1. Mini Language Dives have the same overall purpose and follow the same general process as full Language Dives but are condensed to 5 minutes, narrowing students’ attention on deconstructing the focus structure, reconstructing the sentence, and practicing the focus structure. Mini Language Dives give ELLs additional support in building language and literacy skills, as well as habits of mind. Mini Language Dives are most often optional and can be found in the corresponding lessons within this guide. When required for all students, Mini Language Dives are built into the body of the lesson in the Teacher Guide. In this Unit, optional Mini Language Dives appear in Lessons 1, 9, and 10–11.

Diversity and Inclusion

Investigate the routines, practices, rituals, beliefs, norms, and experiences that are important to ELLs and their families. Integrate this background into the classroom as students explore food justice. Be mindful that student access to healthy food may vary by geographical location and the families and communities they are part of. Consider also personal and cultural differences in diet.

Be mindful of ELLs’ formal schooling experiences, degree of home- and English-language development, length of time in the United States and in US schools, and family backgrounds. These variables impact the ways in which students will progress in their English-language acquisition across the domains of speaking, listening, reading, and writing. Depending on their background, ELLs may often have strong oral proficiency in their home languages, with less proficiency in reading and writing. Likewise, the oral English-language proficiency of ELLs may be more highly developed than their abilities in comprehending and producing written language. In light of this, give consideration to when ELLs might be struggling with content and when they might be struggling with the skill-specific proficiency needed to understand what they read or to express concepts in writing. Use multimodal input on topics simultaneously (e.g., read-alouds, English-language subtitles on videos) to help students begin to align their proficiency in receptive skills (listening/reading) and in their productive skills (speaking/writing). Provide continued opportunities for students to express their understanding of topics orally.

Look for ways to provide opportunities to draw on and incorporate students’ home languages into their learning. Support ELLs in strategically using their home languages in the classroom to enrich their engagement with tasks and to deepen their understanding of content and concepts. Encourage students to engage in discussions in home-language groups, to reflect in writing in their home language, and to make connections between linguistic features of the English language and their home language. For content-based tasks, when possible, provide translated texts and audiovisual materials to help ELLs gain access to topics in their home languages.

Create a supportive and inclusive classroom environment by reminding students that everyone is working toward improvement. Be sure to highlight and praise growth and development rather than relative performance. Use as a topic or text warmer or reflection with the entire class: a check-in at any strategic point during the unit to continually connect students’ personal experience to the topic or text and to share how each one has changed and grown in association with the other. Invite students to share any cultural connections they may have made with the text and topic. Foster inclusive action by creating space for students to express their feelings about access to food choices, knowing that these discussions may help create equity or unearth injustices, or both. Be mindful of the link between food and culture, and create space for students to share about their unique experiences and traditions. Consult with a guidance counselor, school social worker, or ESL teacher for further investigation of diversity and inclusion.

Conversation Cues

Encourage productive and equitable conversation with Conversation Cues, which are questions that help students achieve four goals:

- (Goal 1) encourage all students to talk and be understood,

- (Goal 2) listen carefully to one another and seek to understand,

- (Goal 3) deepen thinking, and

- (Goal 4) think with others to expand the conversation (adapted from Michaels, Sarah and Cathy O’Connor. *Talk Science Primer*. TERC, 2012. http://inquiryproject.terc.edu/shared/pd/TalkScience_Primer.pdf. Based on Chapin, S., O’Connor, C., and Anderson, N. \[2009\]. *Classroom Discussions: Using Math Talk to Help Students Learn, Grades K–6*. Second Edition. Math Solutions Publications).

Refer to the Tools Page (http://eled.org/tools) for the complete set of cues. Goal 1 Conversation Cues are introduced in Lesson 1, and suggestions for integrating Conversation Cues into instruction are presented across lessons. For ELLs, Conversation Cues are especially critical because they improve language-processing abilities and increase engagement and participation.

Use Conversation Cues as often as possible to gradually release thinking and expression of ideas to students; avoid using Conversation Cues as a way of searching for the “right” answer. Students often struggle to create productive and equitable conversation during Turn and Talk or Think-Pair-Share protocols; Conversation Cues can make the difference. Recall that the main goals of Conversation Cues are supporting students to express their ideas (Goal 1), listen to other students’ ideas (Goal 2), deepen their own ideas (Goal 3), and build on other students’ ideas (Goal 4).

Consider this model transcription from a classroom where about eighty-five percent of students are ELLs. The teacher is supporting students to build their ideas about the choice an author made when writing this sentence about an athlete’s factors for success: *There were many factors that led to Rickey’s success, but it was support from others in baseball that was most important*. Students can carry the Conversation Cues into small groups to support their own independent productive and equitable conversations.

Mr. Valencia: What if I replace **but** with **and**? **And** is also a conjunction. How would **and** change the meaning? I'll give you some time to think. Emma, you want to give it a shot?

Emma: It is adding on to the, like, the idea, of the first (part of the) sentence?

Mr. Valencia: Can anyone repeat or rephrase what Emma just said?

Santiago: It would have the same idea as the first two chunks.

Mr. Valencia: Right, **and** would have the same idea as the first two chunks. Two connecting, same ideas. So how does **but** change that for me? Jazmin?

Jazmin: **But** would change it.

Mr. Valencia: Can you say more about that, Jazmin?

Jazmin: It would change it because **but** would say there are many things happening, but this is the one.

Mr. Valencia: So does anyone want to add something else to that?

Daniel: **But** is saying this is the main thing happening.

Mr. Valencia: Right, now the sentence is going to the main factor (for success), or a contrast. **But** is something that is going to tell us a contrast. (Exchange continues.)

Strategic Grouping

Students work in pairs and small groups during text-based discussions, Language Dives, and other tasks. For Language Dives and other tasks that focus on language, match ELLs with a partner who has greater language proficiency. For text-based discussions that focus on argument and structure, pair ELLs with students who share the same home language to allow for rich discussion around ideas. The conversations that happen as a result of such strategic pairing will greatly serve the language development of both partners.

In-Class Reading

In this unit, students read an article about GMOs in Lessons 1 and 2 to begin thinking about the factors that influence our access to healthy food. In the following lessons, students choose from among preselected topics (organic foods, high-fructose corn syrup, pesticides, food deserts) and carry out independent research, reading from a variety of texts on their selected topic. ELLs benefit from a gradual-release approach to in-class reading that increases their level of independence over time. For heavier support, ELLs may find it helpful to follow along during a read-aloud, and for lighter support, students can take turns reading aloud from the text and following along in small groups.

Text-Based Discussions

As in Module 1 and Unit 1 of this module, consider breaking down content, share-outs, or tasks into two parts for ELLs: cognitive and linguistic. First, invite home-language use to allow students to more comfortably process their ideas. This will allow students to first focus on the cognitive demands necessary to complete particularly demanding content, share-outs, or tasks. In addition, inviting home-language use helps students build academic mindsets. After they have met the cognitive demands in their home languages, they can be invited to discuss the task in classroom English, a language they are still learning.

Differentiated Materials

Differentiated materials are available for ELLs and other students who would benefit from an increased level of support. These resources have been modified for the purposes of creating accessibility to content and concepts and supporting language development. Depending upon the task being carried out, images, selected response options, answer banks, sentence frames, or model responses have been embedded to guide students’ thinking without compromising a focus on standards and the skills that students are developing and applying to meet them.

Celebration

Celebrate the courage, enthusiasm, diversity, and bilingual assets that ELLs bring to the classroom. Additionally, students can celebrate their successful attempts at communication, focusing on progress rather than perfection.
