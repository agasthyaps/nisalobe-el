![](media/image1.png) Guiding Questions and Big Ideas

The following guiding questions frame the work of this module.

What factors influence our access to healthy food? How do we research this?

- *It’s important to build more awareness about the variety of food choices consumers need to make and the impact each has on health and sustainability.*

- *When researching access to healthy food, the credibility of a source is important.*

- *Some of the evidence provided to support arguments about access to healthy food may be irrelevant or insufficient.*

- *Information is available through different mediums, and there are advantages and disadvantages to each one. How we access information influences how we interpret it.*

What will your student be doing at school?

**Research access to healthy food:** In Unit 2, students are introduced to new research skills as they explore access to healthy food. As a class, students are guided through the research process as they study GMOs (Genetically Modified Foods), and how GMOs impact access to healthy food (W.8.7, W.8.9). Students then choose their own independent research topic—either pesticides, organic food, food deserts, or high-fructose corn syrup—and research independently. This prepares students for their mid-unit assessment in which they will be given a new research question and assessed on their research skills (W.8.7, W.8.9). Research skills students explore are listed below:

- Determine online search terms for the research question posed.

- Find appropriate resources on a topic online.

- Evaluate relevant and accurate information about a topic.

- Record textual evidence that most strongly supports the topic.

**Write an informative essay about access to healthy food:** In the second half of Unit 2, students plan and draft an informative essay explaining how their independent research topic impacts access to healthy food (W.82). Students analyze a model essay and learn that an effective informative essay is made of the following components, which they practice before writing their own essay:

- Provide a clear focus, and maintain the focus consistently throughout the piece.

- Introduce the topic clearly, giving readers a preview of the piece.

- Write a conclusion that supports the information presented.

- Use strategies such as definition, classification, comparison/contrast, and cause/effect to organize information.

- Use a variety of appropriate transitions to show how ideas and information connect.

- Include relevant facts, definitions, details, quotations, and examples to explain my thinking.

- Use precise language and domain-specific vocabulary.

The following text is an example informative essay on the topic of CSAs (Community Supported Agriculture):

Model Essay: “CSAs”

RI.8.1, W.8.2, W.8.4, W.8.7, W.8.8, W.8.10, L.8.6

**Prompt:** How do CSAs influence our access to healthy food?

Access to healthy food is a basic human need, and it can be complicated. In America today, many factors influence our access to healthy food. Do we have enough money to buy healthy food? Is healthy food available where we live? Can we find food that is grown in good soil? Can we find food that is free of chemicals that might cause harm? Can our soil and water contribute to growing healthy food? Can we find healthy food from healthy animals? All of these are factors we consider when we think about access to healthy food. Today, one way of getting food is through a CSA. The term **CSA** stands for “community supported agriculture.” CSAs work by subscription. At the beginning of the growing season, people buy shares in a local farm. In exchange, they get fruits and vegetables (and sometimes meat or dairy) over the course of the growing season. This is usually around twenty weeks, from June through October (Cleveland Clinic, 2016). One estimate from Penn State says that between 30,000 and 50,000 people in the United States belong to a CSA (Penn State Extension, 2014).

CSAs have an influence on our access to healthy food. They have many advantages. Two of the most important are the high quality of the food itself, and the positive impact on the use of fossil fuels.

There is general agreement that CSAs can produce high-quality food. Much of this is because it is locally grown, and the consumers eat it shortly after it has been harvested. Food that comes from far away is older. It has traveled many miles, and has probably sat in a warehouse, before you buy it (Grobinger, University of Vermont, 2010). According to dietician Beth Bluestone from the Cleveland Clinic, “Once produce is harvested, its optimal nutritional value decreases, specifically in vitamins A, B, C and E” (Cleveland Clinic, 2016). Food from a local CSA, however, is ready to eat shortly after harvest. This means that the food from a CSA is very fresh and has higher nutrient levels. Clearly, the food that people get from a CSA is likely to be healthier than even the food from a supermarket, because it has been so recently picked. Besides the benefit of being so fresh, food from a CSA gives the consumer many choices (Cleveland Clinic, 2016). Depending on the time in the growing season, the weekly CSA box contains many different types of fruits and vegetables. In early summer, the customer may get berries, lettuce, and asparagus. Later, foods could include potatoes, watermelon, and apples. The local CSA also gives out information and recipes about how to use this variety of fresh food (Cleveland Clinic, 2016). All of this makes it easier for people to eat healthy food, so their access to healthy food has increased.

In addition to increasing access to healthy food through freshness and variety, CSAs increase access to healthy food by having a positive impact on the use of fossil fuels. In *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Michael Pollan points out that food generally has to travel around 1,500 miles to get from the farmer to the consumer (Pollan, 158). That means a lot of fossil fuel is burned just moving food. Compared to that, CSA crops are local and so travel only a very short distance to get to the consumer. As Utah State University Extension notes, “Reducing the distance food travels (food miles) cuts down on associated fossil fuel consumption, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions” (Utah State University Extension, 2012). This reduction in fossil fuel use matters a lot for the environment. The climate of the planet is changing; the average temperature has gone up by 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit since 1800. Burning fossil fuels is the major cause of this increase (Union of Concerned Scientists, 2015). While 1.5 degrees may not seem like a lot, scientists agree that it is making a huge difference. Ultimately, how healthy the planet is will have a lot to do with people’s access to healthy food. So, cutting down on fossil fuel use by buying food from CSAs will improve access to healthy food.

Overall, most indications are that CSAs improve people’s access to healthy food. Even though 50,000 people using them does not seem like a lot, CSAs play an important part for those users in having reliable access to healthy food. If we as a society could support the creation of more CSAs, we would be serving our people and our planet well, both now and in the future.

Present findings to classmates in a Desktop Teaching Activity:** For their end of unit assessment, students will participate in a Desktop Teaching Activity to share their research findings with classmates. During the Desktop Teaching Activity, students will prepare a mini lesson based on the case study they researched in the second half of the unit and will present their findings along with visual supports. (RI.8.1, SL.8.4, SL.8.5, L.8.6).

The Desktop Teaching Activity asks students to

- prepare a lesson plan: students synthesize and outline the important information from their informative essay topic;

- practice presenting their lesson: students prepare their talking points, create a note-catcher for their peers, and gather visual supports that enhance the learning they will present; and

- present their lesson to a group of their peers: students share what they learned with their peers and listen to presentations from their peers in order to create a more robust understanding of all of the independent research topics in Unit 2.

The reading and writing skills students develop in the fourteen lessons in Unit 2 prepare them for the assessments described above.

Central to the EL Education curriculum is a focus on “habits of character” and social-emotional learning. With this in mind, students work on various habits of character throughout the curriculum:

- Work to Become Effective Learners—developing mindsets and skills for success in college, career, and life (e.g., initiative, responsibility, perseverance, collaboration)

- Work to Become Ethical People—treating others well and standing up for what is right (e.g., empathy, integrity, respect, compassion)

- Work to Contribute to a Better World—putting their learning to use to improve communities (e.g., citizenship, service)

In this unit, students focus on working to become effective learners as they show perseverance to learn and practice new research and speaking skills. Students collaborate with classmates to learn and practice new habits of internet research. Students take initiative and take responsibility and own their work as they write their own informative essays about the research they have conducted.

How can you support your student at home?

Talk to your student about the guiding questions, particularly if any of the topics raised might be sensitive for your student or family.

Talk to your student about the texts he or she is reading in the classroom, particularly if any of the topics raised might be sensitive for your student.

Reach out to teachers if you have any questions or concerns about the text.

Talk to your student about the food choices presented in *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*. Discuss priorities or traditions your family may have around food.

Read informational books and articles with your student relevant to food choices, and discuss issues related to food production, distribution, packaging, etc.

Explore issues related to food in your own community. Discuss any challenges people have accessing healthy food in your area, or any ways your community supports access to healthy food.

Use research skills students are learning in class to conduct research on a topic of interest at home.

Discuss real-world applications for researching and presenting findings in both written and presentation form.

Unit 2: Homework

Students engage in two kinds of reading for homework, with choice reading as an additional option.

**Anchor text reading:** Students preread chapters of the anchor text, *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, to prepare for the next lesson. They also reread the chapters of the text read in class and answer questions about it.

**Independent research reading:** When not reading his or her anchor text, your student is expected to independently research the topic. In the first lesson, students complete both types of reading as both independent research reading and the anchor text are introduced. When not assigned readings in the anchor text, students read topic-related books of their choice for approximately 20 minutes <u>each day</u> and respond to a prompt of choice in the <u>front</u> of the independent reading journal. These are usually books your student will bring home from school; however, they may be topic-related books chosen by your student at the public or your home library. Prompts for independent reading can be found in the homework materials provided.

**Choice reading:** If your student would also like to independently read and respond to a book of free choice, he or she may use the <u>back</u> of the independent reading journal. Prompts for independent reading can be found in the homework materials provided.

Independent Research Reading

**Directions:** Remember to record responses to research reading in the front of your independent reading journal and responses to choice reading in the back. Try to choose a different prompt each time.

Record any new vocabulary in your vocabulary log. Underline vocabulary found during independent reading.

**Record:**

- Date

- Title and author of your reading book

- Pages you have read

- Prompt

- Response

**Example:**

<u>Date:</u> 10/13/2020

<u>Book Title and Author:</u> *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* (Young Readers Edition) by Michael Pollan

<u>Pages Read:</u> 17–29

<u>Prompt:</u> What major ideas are present in the text you read? Give text details that convey those ideas.

<u>Response:</u> In this section, the author, Michael Pollan, talks about the prevalence of corn in the American diet. He shares examples of corn consumers knowingly ingest and highlights food products containing corn that are surprising to most Americans (e.g., wax on the vegetables we eat!). Details that he mentions on pages 18–19 are about how many items we eat that contain corn. In the example, he informs the reader that although we think of supermarkets as housing a large variety of items, most of those items contain corn. He goes on to say that corn is fed to the cattle, pigs, chicken, and fish we eat; to the chickens whose eggs we eat; and to the cows that produce the dairy products we consume. This is just the beginning of the long list of items containing corn that Pollan shares with the reader. These details highlight how frequently Americans ingest corn—sometimes intentionally, and many times unknowingly. Pollan’s knowledge of these details and how he lays them out to the reader early in the book demonstrate his interest and purpose in writing the book: to inform consumers about the food they eat so they can make healthy food choices.

**Consider using the following independent reading prompts.**[^1]

- How does this text add to your understanding of one of the guiding questions of the module?

- Which habits of character are demonstrated in the text? Explain.

- What is the central idea or theme of the text? How was this idea developed?

- Record two or three facts in your own words that you learned from the text.

- Summarize your research reading today in no more than five sentences.

- What major ideas are present in the text you read? Give text details that convey those ideas.

- What questions do you have about the topic after reading?

- Choose one new word from your reading today, and analyze it on a vocabulary square:

|                                                   |                                            |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Definition in your own words**                  | **Synonyms** (words with the same meaning) |
| **Words with the same affix or root**             | **Sketch**                                 |
| **Translation in home language** (if appropriate) |                                            |

Vocabulary

**Directions:** In the classroom, you have been recording words from your texts in your vocabulary log. Throughout this unit, you have been research reading topic-related books at home to build your knowledge of where food comes from and recording words in your independent reading journal.

Choose a word from your research reading or from a text you’ve read in class and add the word to your vocabulary log. Try to choose a different word to add and to practice a different vocabulary strategy each time. For each word, be sure to add the following:

1.  The definition, or meaning, of the word

<!-- -->

3.  The vocabulary strategy you used to figure out the meaning of the word

4.  A sketch or diagram that helps you to better understand the meaning of the word

Record new vocabulary in vocabulary logs and mark academic vocabulary with a symbol, for example a star:

- Academic vocabulary: words you might find in informational texts on many different topics. For example, the words *evidence* and *rationale* are words that could be found in books on any topic.

- Domain-specific vocabulary: words about a particular topic. For example, the words *tadpoles*, *frogspawn*, and *amphibian* are some that would be found on the topic of frogs.

**Vocabulary Strategies**

As a reminder, the vocabulary strategies we’ve been working on in class are:

- Context: read the sentence around the word.

- Look at the affixes for clues.

- Look at the root of the word for clues.

- Use a dictionary.

- Discuss the word with another person (after attempting some of the above strategies).

[^1]: Some of the prompts will not be appropriate for the text students are reading. Invite students to choose a prompt that works for the text they have just read.
