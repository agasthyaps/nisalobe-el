5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

RI.8.1, L.8.1a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

A new kind of tomato **was bred to resist rotting** and give it a longer shelf life. (from page 4 of  
“To GMO or NOT to GMO?” by George Erdosh and Marcia Amidon Lusted)

**Lesson 1 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after students have read the text in Work Time B.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target (**I can identify evidence to support an analysis of the influence GMOs have on our access to healthy food**) and RI.8.1 by drawing students’ attention to evidence from the text that supports an analysis of GMOs’ effects on access to healthy food. The sentence also helps students to address L8.1a, as it contains both an infinitive and a gerund. Supporting Standards: L.8.1b, L.8.3a

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses an infinitive phrase with an embedded gerund inside of it for the purpose of describing why a new kind of tomato was bred.

- Transfer: **to** + base form of verb + gerund to describe actions in various writing tasks, including when writing the informative essay in preparation for the End of Unit 2 Assessment.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **A new kind of tomato <u>was bred to resist rotting</u> and give it a longer shelf life.**

- Ask:

“What is this sentence about?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **was bred to resist rotting**

- Ask:

“What does this chunk tell us about a new kind of tomato?” (that it was genetically modified to keep it from spoiling or deteriorating)

- Note: as needed, allow students to consult a dictionary to verify the meanings of **breed**, **resist**, and **rot**.

“What is the function of the infinitive phrase to resist rotting in this sentence? Is it a noun, an adjective, or an adverb? How do you know?” (This infinitive phrase is an adverb. It modifies the verb bred, giving us more information about <u>why</u> a new kind of tomato was bred.)

“Can you figure out the function of the gerund rotting within this infinitive phrase? Is it a noun, an adjective, or an adverb? How do you know?” (This gerund is a noun. It is the direct object of to resist, telling us <u>what</u> the new kind of tomato resists.)

- Ask:

“What happens if we replace to resist with a gerund?” (The meaning doesn’t make sense because the verb breed can be followed by an infinitive, but not a gerund.)

“What happens if we replace rotting with an infinitive?” (The meaning doesn’t make sense because the verb resist can be followed by a gerund, but not an infinitive.)

- Briefly explain to or remind students that gerunds and infinitives often follow verbs. If time allows, explain that there are five types of verbs in English:

1.  verbs that can be followed by a gerund but not an infinitive

2.  verbs that can be followed by an infinitive but not a gerund

3.  verbs that can be followed by either a gerund or infinitive and have the same meaning

4.  verbs that can be followed by a gerund or infinitive but have different meanings

5.  verbs that cannot be followed by a gerund or infinitive

- As time allows, guide students through the suggested extension exercise in the Teacher’s Guide for English Language Learners to further explore patterns in gerund and infinitive usage.

- Ask:

“How can we use gerunds and infinitives in our speaking or writing?” (Responses will vary.)

Reconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **A new kind of tomato <u>was bred to resist rotting</u> and give it a longer shelf life.**

- Ask:

“Who bred this tomato to resist rotting? How do you know?” (We don’t know for sure because the sentence does not provide this information, but we can assume that scientists did so based on the contextual information we have from the article and what we already know about genetically modified foods.)

- Note: This subject of this sentence is omitted because this sentence is written in passive voice. See the Teacher’s Guide for English Language Learners for extension activities that use this sentence to support work with L.8.1b and L.8.3a, which will be assessed in Module 3.

“How does the information in this sentence support an analysis of the influence GMOs have on access to healthy food?” (This sentence provides an example of one way that GMOs impact our food choices. The modification of this kind of tomato makes it available to consumers for a longer period of time.)

- Ask:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does this Mini Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target: I can identify evidence to support an analysis of the influence GMOs have on our access to healthy food”? (Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display:

> **The students have been told \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**
>
> infinitive gerund
>
> (**to** + verb = infinitive)
>
> (verb + **-ing** = gerund)

- Say:

“In your own words and with your partners, use this frame to talk about something a teacher might say to students, using an infinitive and a gerund.”

- Sample response:

> **The students have been told <u>to stop texting</u>**.
>
> infinitive gerund
>
> (**to** + verb = infinitive)
>
> (verb + **-ing** = gerund)
