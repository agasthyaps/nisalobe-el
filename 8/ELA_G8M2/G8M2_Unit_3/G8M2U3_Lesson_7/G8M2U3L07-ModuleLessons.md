Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.8.1b – Opening A: Students answer questions as they analyze the role sentences play in Proof Paragraph 1 of the model argument essay.

- W.8.1b – Work Time A: Students use the Painted Essay® structure to more closely analyze a model Proof Paragraph, to understand how it supports a point/reason with valid reasoning and relevant evidence.

- W.8.1b – Work Time B: Students orally rehearse their first Proof Paragraph, sharing points, evidence, and the reasoning that connects back to the main claim.

- SL.8.4 – Work Time B: Students present the ideas for their first Proof Paragraph to a partner, determine whether they have relevant evidence and sound reasoning, and then make a plan to enhance their writing as needed.

- W.8.1b – Work Time C: Students work in pairs to draft their first Proof Paragraph, choosing relevant evidence to support their claims and using logical reasoning to explain their thinking.

- W.8.5 – Work Time C: Students write a Proof Paragraph that includes a reason that supports the main claim with relevant evidence and sufficient reasoning.

- In this lesson, students use their Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer to draft Proof Paragraph 1 of their practice essays.

- Students focus on working to become effective learners, focusing on collaborating with peers while writing their practice essay and persevering to independently plan a Proof Paragraph.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release those students who are ready, to read and analyze the model Proof Paragraph 1 independently and then move on to drafting Proof Paragraph 1 of their practice essay with a partner.

- An optional Mini Language Dive, intended for use after students analyze the Proof Paragraph in Work Time B, is available in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Provide students with the opportunity to analyze the transitional words in the model essay. Consider partner work that supports students to identify words that signal sequence or transition in additional sources—reviewing informational texts from Unit 2, or selections of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* for students to annotate. Synthesizing and listing transitional words on an anchor chart will enhance student understanding.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the second half of this unit, students have been analyzing a model and using their analysis to draft the introduction of their practice essay. This lesson continues those routines to guide students in writing the first Proof Paragraph of their essay.

Support All Students

- In Lessons 5–10, students work with the same partner on a practice argument essay. Provide differentiated support by purposefully preselecting student partnerships.

- While students will complete their own written version of the practice essay, consider the variety of ways that student partnerships can support one another to more deeply understand the genre of argument writing and successfully complete their work. Choral reading, peer planning, shared writing, shared evidence gathering, clarifying tasks, varying scribing responsibilities, editing support, etc., are all possible roles partners can play for one another in these lessons. ▲

- Students may need additional support while writing their Proof Paragraph. Group those students for a discussion to help them find the best evidence to support their points/reasons and elaborate on that evidence, providing reasoning to show it supports the point. ▲

- Although students have had practice creating accurate citations, provide various examples of accurate citations for students to view online or scribed on an anchor chart as they work to include relevant evidence in their Proof Paragraph. ▲

- Students may have limited argument writing experience and be unfamiliar with strong Proof Paragraphs in this and other genres. Providing examples and scaffolded support (sentence stems, annotated graphic organizers, models of Proof Paragraphs and opportunities to talk through their ideas) will help their writing. If needed, pull a small group to review this aspect of argument writing. ▲

- In Work Time A, students will be guided to use the visual concept of an “evidence sandwich” as a way of identifying and analyzing the parts of a Proof Paragraph. They will use this both to deconstruct the model essay, and to help guide the planning and writing of their own practice essays. ▲

- Pull small instructional groups that need more scaffolding and support. Students might need extended verbal processing time to develop their reasoning statements. ▲

- Consistently referring to the model argument essay will act as a support for students who need reminders of what strong writing looks like. ▲

- Providing written and verbal directions, and charting the steps they will take on an anchor chart, could help students as they plan for their writing. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson follows a similar pattern to Lesson 6, with scaffolded tasks that guide students from analysis to independent writing. Students work in groups to analyze the first Proof Paragraph 1 of the model essay before planning and writing the first Proof Paragraph of the practice argument essay. Ample time for discussion and oral planning is built into the lesson, and Closing and Assessment A invites students to give and receive feedback to further their learning.

- ELLs may find it challenging to complete their own written version of the practice essay in this series of lessons. Pair ELLs thoughtfully with supportive peers who can help them navigate the complexities of the task sequencing and the tasks themselves, and encourage students to refer back to the model essay, the text, and the Argument Writing checklist, frequently, while writing.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.C.11 and 8.I.C.12.

Assessment Guidance

- Use the Grade 8 Writing Process checklist to assess students’ writing abilities in Work Times B and C (see the Tools page at http://eled.org/tools).

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will write the second Proof Paragraph of their practice argument essay. In Lesson 9, students will write the counterclaim of their practice argument essay. In Lesson 10, students will work on their conclusions and then write an independent argument essay during their End of Unit 3 Assessment in Lessons 11–12.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare Analyze the Model: Proof Paragraph handout and planner (one per student).

- Ensure there is a copy of Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 7 at each student’s workspace.

- Strategically pair students for the work in Opening A with at least one strong reader per pair.

- Review the Argument Writing checklist to become familiar with what will be required of students over the remainder of the unit.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time C: Prepare devices with word-processing capabilities for students to continue drafting.

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous modules to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.8.1b (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **3**, **Lesson** **7**.

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique to review their responses.

- Clarify any misconceptions about the role that the opening and closing sentences play in Proof Paragraphs (stating the reason that supports the main claim, and restating the reason supporting the main claim), and answer any questions from the group.

- Ask students to refer to their **Practice** **Argument** **Essay** **Writing** **Plan** **graphic** **organizer**, and review the opening and closing sentences they planned for the Proof Paragraphs in their practice essay.

- Direct students to Turn and Talk about the following questions:

“What opening sentence could you write that states a reason that supports your main claim?” (Responses will vary.)

“What closing sentence could you write that restates the reason that supports your main claim?” (Responses will vary.)

“What revisions will make these sentences stronger?” (Responses will vary, but students may mention they need to reword their sentences, include a “because” statement, etc.)

- Inform students that they will have the opportunity to refine the sentences in Work Time B.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- After Opening A, allow students to spend time working with partners to generate opening and closing sentences for Proof Paragraph 1 of their Practice Argument Essay immediately following the analysis and discussion of topic and closing sentences in Proof Paragraph 1 of the model essay, to allow for direct transfer of learning. Invite students to share their sentences with other groups to check the clarity of connections between their claims and topic and closing sentences.

Work Time

A. Analyze the Model: Proof Paragraph 1 – W.8.1b (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify the reasons, evidence, and reasoning in Proof Paragraph 1 of a model argument essay.”

- Remind students that one of the most important aspects of a Proof Paragraph is including evidence that directly supports the reasons stated. Within each Proof Paragraph, the author creates an “evidence sandwich.” Thinking about something we are all familiar with, a sandwich, will help us see how Proof Paragraphs are built. The “evidence sandwich” includes three parts:

- The reason (bread)

- The evidence introduced with context (the filling)

- The reasoning (more bread)

- Ask students to retrieve their **Model** **Essay**: “ **Transportation** **Choices**.” Read Proof Paragraph 1 aloud, prompting students to think about these three components of a Proof Paragraph as they follow along.

- Distribute and display the **Analyze** **the** **Model**: **Proof** **Paragraph** **planner**. Point out the organization of the handout to students. Tell them that it lists the text of Proof Paragraph 1, but it is chunked into three parts.

- Read aloud the first chunk of text. Tell students that this opening sentence is the reason. In the “evidence sandwich,” it is the top piece of bread. Label these parts on the Analyze the Model: Proof Paragraph handout and planner, using the **Analyze** **the** **Model**: **Proof** **Paragraph** **planner** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as needed.

- Continue on to the next chunk of text, and select a student to read the second chunk of text aloud to the group. Tell students that this chunk of text is the evidence. The evidence section of the “evidence sandwich” introduces the evidence with any context the reader needs to understand the evidence and then lists the actual evidence itself, which might include a quote.

- Ask partners to read the final chunk of text with each other. Tell students that this final, bottom bread section of the “evidence sandwich” is the reasoning. Remind students that in addition to selecting supporting evidence, another critical aspect of a Proof Paragraph is the reasoning. Explain that writers use this kind of connected thinking called “reasoning” to further explain and discuss their main claim.

- Reinforce the importance of using reasoning to develop the point and further explain the importance of the evidence.

- Share with students that they will be creating “evidence sandwiches” and paying careful attention to crafting adequate reasoning sentences as they write their Proof Paragraph 1.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“Describe the important elements of an “evidence sandwich.” (“Evidence sandwiches” have three parts—reason; context and evidence; and reasoning.)

“What are your important takeaways about how writers use reasoning in a Proof Paragraph?” (Students should point out that reasoning further explains the evidence, ties it to the reason and main claim, and helps the reader understand the writer’s thinking.)

- Invite students to help record important aspects of Proof Paragraphs on the **Characteristics** **of** **Argument** **Writing** **anchor** **chart**.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time A, invite a student to lead a think-aloud. Display the introduction of the model essay. Have the student annotate aloud, in real-time, the writer’s thinking process. Invite students to note this thinking and recall the questions asked aloud.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time A, host a think-aloud. In a small group of students who need the heaviest support, display the introduction of the model essay. Annotate aloud, in real-time, the writer’s thinking process. Invite students to note this thinking and recall the questions asked aloud.

Work Time

B. Orally Rehearse Proof Paragraph 1 – W.8.5 (10 minutes)

- Ask students to join their practice essay partner. Provide students an opportunity to verbally review the plan they created for Proof Paragraph 1 of their practice essay, planned in Lessons 5. Students should verbally rehearse each evidence sandwich they plan on using in their practice essay Proof Paragraph.

- As applicable, support students by prompting pairs to ask each other the following three questions:

“What will you write as your reason/bread?” (Responses should identify the reasons students already planned together in Lesson 5.)

“What will you write as your context and evidence/filling?” (Responses will vary.)

“What will you write as your reasoning/bread?” (Responses will vary.)

- Invite students to update the plan they created for Proof Paragraph 1 of their practice essay by recording their responses to the questions above.

Work Time

C. Practice Essay: Draft Proof Paragraph 1 – W.8.1b (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can write Proof Paragraph 1 for my practice essay.”

- Tell students they are now ready to draft Proof Paragraph 1 of their practice essays.

- Invite students to retrieve their **devices**, gather any remaining materials from the list below, and refer to the Characteristics of Argument Writing anchor chart as they write:

- Model Essay: “Transportation Choices”

- **Argument** **Writing** **checklist**

- **Painted** **Essay** ® **template**

- ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma***

- Practice Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer

- Circulate to support students as they write and to identify common issues to use as whole group teaching points.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Closing and Assessment

A. Pair-Share Proof Paragraph 1 – W.8.1b (5 minutes)

- Display and invite students to retrieve their copies of the Argument Writing checklist. Point out the following criteria on the checklist:

- W.8.1a

- W.8.1b

- Invite each pair to swap Proof Paragraphs with another pair, paying attention to the criteria listed above.

- Ask students to share relevant feedback and to note any necessary revisions.

- As necessary, ask questions such as:

“What strengths can you identify in your partner’s work?”

“What next steps can you name for your partner?”

- Invite students to record “Y” for *Yes* and the date in the final column of their Argument Writing checklist if they feel the criteria marked on their checklists have been achieved in their writing in this lesson. Invite students to apply feedback they received by revising their Proof Paragraph 1.

- Use total participation techniques to gather responses from the group regarding strengths and next steps for drafting their second Proof Paragraph independently in the next lesson.

Homework

A. Revise Proof Paragraph 1

- Students revise Proof Paragraph 1 of their practice argument essay, based on feedback and criteria.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent** **reading** **journal**.
