<td>Cars, in particular, are very expensive to own and operate. A 2013 article in <em>USA Today</em> states that “on average, the cost of driving 15,000 miles a year rose 1.17 cents to 60.8 cents per mile, or $9,122 per year” (<em>USA Today</em>). Driving a car is expensive in many ways. The driver has to pay for gas, insurance, and maintenance, all on top of the car payment itself. That’s a huge expense. Taking the bus every day costs significantly less than that. So does travelling by train or light rail. A monthly transit pass in Denver, for example, is just $99, or $1,200 per year for an individual (RTD Denver).</td>

<td>Even for a family of five, that would be significantly more affordable than owning a car. Also, many companies provide discounts or incentives to employees who take public transportation. This makes the cost come down even further. Saving money is important to people. Money that is spent on a car is money that is not available for other things. Using public transportation frees up more money to people for other needs. Once all of the factors have been considered, it’s evident that public transportation is the best choice because it saves money.</td>
