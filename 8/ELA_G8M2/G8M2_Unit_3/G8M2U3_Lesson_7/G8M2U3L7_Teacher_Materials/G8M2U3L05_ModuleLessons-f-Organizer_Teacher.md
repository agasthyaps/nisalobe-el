(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Focus Prompt:** Your job is to write an essay that defends the recommendation that consumers should make every effort to purchase grass-fed beef in order to more positively impact their own health and the health of the environment. Be sure you give at least two reasons to support your claim about grass-fed beef, use evidence from the text as you do so, and explain your reasoning. You should also take into account the people who disagree with what you think, and keep a very professional tone in your proposal.

**Main Claim:**

> One of the most important things we can do to ensure that our food is healthy and
>
> sustainable is to make the choice to buy grass-fed beef.

**Introduction**

How will you catch the reader’s attention? (Consider using facts, statistics, quotations, or anecdotes.)

- A lot for consumers to consider when making food choices

- They need to think about **type of diet, where food comes from, and impact of food choices on health/environment.**

- People who eat meat need to consider **how beef is raised.**

What context about the text or topic does your reader need in order to make sense of the rest of your essay?

- Define grass-fed beef.

- Choices can impact **human health and the environment.**

**Main Claim:** One of the most important things we can do to ensure that our food is healthy and sustainable is to make the choice to buy grass-fed beef.

What are the two main reasons/points you will be offering to support this claim?

Reason/Point 1:

> grass-fed beef healthier

Reason/Point 2:

> grass-fed beef better for our farms and environment = more sustainable
>
> system

**Proof Paragraph(s) for Point 1**

Point 1: What is the first reason you are offering to support your claim?

- grass-fed beef healthier for consumers

Context: What context does the reader need to understand the evidence you are using?

- Cows that eat grass gain nutrients essential for both animals/humans.

- Humans who eat meat benefit from the nutrients.

Evidence: What evidence from the texts supports this reason?

- “Green grass has large quantities of beta-carotene, vitamin E and folic acid. These natural chemicals are important for a healthy diet” (Pollan 229).

- “Corn-fed beef,” says Pollan, “contains more saturated fats than the meat of grass-fed animals. Too much saturated fat has been linked to heart disease and other health problems” (Pollan 71).

Reasoning: What reasoning develops your point and ties it back to the claim?

- grass instead of corn \> healthier cattle

- eat grass-fed beef \> healthier meat \> healthy people

- Looking at all of the health benefits that come from eating grass-fed beef, clear that it’s the better choice.

**Proof Paragraph(s) for Point 2**

Point 2: What is the second reason you are offering to support your claim?

- Eating only grass-fed beef is better for our farms and environment; more sustainable system.

Context: What context does the reader need to understand the evidence you are using?

- grass-fed beef far better for environment

- promotes healthy ecosystem

Evidence: What evidence from the texts supports this reason?

- Cows that graze and eat grasses (instead of being confined) don’t kill the plants. Cows can even protect the habitat by eating shrubs and trees that would compete with the grasses. The cow also spreads grass seed and fertilizes it with manure (Pollan 65).

- “The animals’ wastes drop onto the land, becoming nutrients for the next cycle of crops. In feedlots and other forms of factory farming, however, the animals’ wastes build up in enormous quantities, becoming a staggering source of water and air pollution” (foodrevolution.org).

Reasoning: What reasoning develops your point and ties it back to the claim?

- Eating grass-fed beef is part of a sustainable system.

- environment can remain healthy

- Animals, plants, and people can thrive without harmful chemicals.

- For people who eat meat, consuming grass-fed beef is a win-win.

- best choice for an individual and farms and the environment overall

**Counterclaim**

Counterclaim: What counterclaim might others raise to refute your claim?

- grass-fed beef too expensive for many consumers; health benefits not clear

- **grass-fed beef expensive because of government policies that support growing corn and agribusiness rather than smaller farms**

<!-- -->

- **Policies may change if consumers demand support for smaller grass-fed beef farmers.**

Refute: How do you respond to this counterclaim?

- true that grass-fed beef may be costlier in some areas; takes longer to grow cattle on grass than on corn

- Eating grass-fed beef rather than corn-fed beef does not have to be more expensive.

- Corn-fed beef is cheaper due to government policies that support growing corn (foodrevolution.org).

Reasoning: What reasoning supports your response?

- Policies benefit large agribusiness, not farmers. More consumers start demanding grass-fed beef in their local grocery store \> lawmakers may begin to listen to change those policies.

- Maybe pass laws that help support the grass-fed beef industry.

- corn-fed beef no longer so cheap, and grass-fed beef more affordable

**Conclusion**

Briefly restate your main claim from the introduction:

- Overall, even though many different food options are available for meat eaters, the choice that rises to the top is selecting grass-fed beef whenever possible.

What are your further reflections on this topic?

Why does this argument/claim matter?

What would happen if this claim were not acted upon?

Who is likely to benefit from this?

- People in our community will see health benefits from this choice.

- They will be investing in farms that help create a more sustainable world.
