<td><p>Evidence and Reasoning from Unit 2 Research:</p>
<p>Healthy and Sustainable:</p>
<p><strong>GMO corn has increased the amount of corn available. A review of 6,000 studies between 1996 and 2016 showed that GMOs had increased production of corn by up to 25 percent (Dovey, 2018).</strong></p>
<p><strong>GMO canola oil has fewer trans fats than regular canola oil (bestfoods.org).</strong></p>
<p><strong>The new genes in some corn make it harder for harmful insects to survive. This means that farmers who grow the GMO corn have been able to use fewer pesticides (Brody, 2018).</strong></p>
<p><strong>This would allow the growing season to last longer. She might take the “frost gene” from parsley (which can take a frost) and splice it into strawberry plants. The new strawberry plants would be a form of GMO (Erdosh and Lusted, 17).</strong></p>
<p>Unhealthy and Unsustainable:</p>
<p><strong>Questions remain about the long-term effects on consumers’ health. For example, the <em>New York Times</em> reported in 2018 about a GMO called EnlistDuo. It is supposed to make crop plants more resistant to weed-killing chemicals. However, it has been found to increase the prevalence of a cancer called non-Hodgkins lymphoma (Brody, 2018).</strong></p>
<p><strong>GMOs have not been in use long enough for us to be certain they are safe (Brody, 2018). If GMOs may make people sick, they are not improving their access to healthy food.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Another question is about the health of the soil that GMO crops are growing in. Some studies show that it is true that pesticide use has fallen by a third with GMOs. This certainly makes for healthier soil. However, the same studies show that herbicide use (weed killers) has increased by 21 percent with GMO crops (Hakim, 2016).</strong></p>
<p><strong>As Michael Pollan points out in <em>The Omnivore’s Dilemma</em>, cattle in feedlots are fed corn because it fattens them quickly. However, corn is not their natural food. He explains, “Their corn-based diet . . . makes them ill” (Pollan, 70).</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-GMO Project explains that “in the absence of credible independent long-term feeding studies, the safety of GMOs is unknown. Increasingly, citizens are taking matters into their own hands and choosing to opt out of the GMO experiment.”</strong></p></td>

<td><p>Evidence and Reasoning from Unit 2 Research:</p>
<p>Healthy and Sustainable:</p>
<p><strong>Food that comes from far away is older. It has traveled many miles, and has probably sat in a warehouse, before you buy it (Grubinger, University of Vermont, 2010).</strong></p>
<p><strong>According to dietician Beth Bluestone from the Cleveland Clinic, “Once produce is harvested, its optimal nutritional value decreases, specifically in vitamins A, B, C and E” (Cleveland Clinic, 2016).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Besides the benefit of being so fresh, food from a CSA gives the consumer many choices (Cleveland Clinic, 2016).</strong></p>
<p><strong>The local CSA also gives out information and recipes about how to use this variety of fresh food (Cleveland Clinic, 2016). All of this makes it easier for people to eat healthy food, so their access to healthy food has increased.</strong></p>
