(Example for Teacher Reference)

**GMOs**

- Healthy:

- GMO foods can be as healthy, if not healthier, than non-GMO foods.

- Sustainable:

- Some GMO foods require fewer pesticides, which is better for fields, streams, and the environment overall.

- Unhealthy:

- Questions about the safety of GMOs remain due to lack of long-term studies on GMO consumption.

- GMO corn, fed to many cattle, can cause them to be sick.

- GMOs used to make crop plants more resistant to weed-killing chemicals have been found to increase the prevalence of a type of cancer.

- Unsustainable:

- Some GMO crops are grown with more pesticides, which can harm plants that are not pests.

**CSAs**

- Healthy:

- CSAs provide consumers with locally grown food, often from small, organic farms that grow healthy vegetables and raise free-range animals.

- Sustainable:

- CSAs provide their consumers with food that is grown locally, thus avoiding the use of fossil fuels for shipping products.

- Unhealthy: N/A

- Unsustainable: N/A

**Organic Food**

- Healthy:

- Organic foods are grown or raised with fewer pesticides.

- Sustainable:

- Using fewer pesticides to grow crops is better for the environment.

- Unhealthy: N/A

- Unsustainable:

- use of fossil fuels to transport organic foods across the country, or between countries

- can be financially unsustainable for many consumers

**Pesticides**

- Healthy:

- A certain amount of pesticide use prevents crops from damage, which allows increased production of healthy fruits and vegetables.

- Sustainable:

- Certain amounts of pesticide prevent crops from damage.

- Unhealthy:

- Pesticides can decrease our access to healthy food because they can be unhealthy for the human body.

- Unsustainable:

- Pesticide use on farms introduces unhealthy chemicals into the environment through runoff into rivers and streams, and negatively impacts animals and humans.

**High-Fructose Corn Syrup**

- Healthy: N/A

- Sustainable: N/A

- Unhealthy:

- Our soft drinks not only contain HFCS, which is fattening, but because it’s so cheap, companies persuade consumers to buy larger servings of sugary drinks.

- Most of the food in fast-food chains contain HFCS, which is fattening and prevents our access to healthy foods at affordable restaurants like McDonald’s.

- Unsustainable:

- Production of GMO corn used to create HFCS has a negative impact on the environment, as it has decreased crop diversity.

**Food Deserts**

- Healthy: N/A

- Sustainable: N/A

- Unhealthy:

- Food deserts prevent people from having access to fresh produce in supermarkets, which can cause disease.

- In a food desert, people need to rely on unhealthy, highly processed food.

- People in impoverished communities do not have access to information about healthy eating, so they continue to eat unhealthy food.

- Unsustainable:

- Food deserts mean that people living in them have to travel significant distances to get to a grocery store. This uses a lot more fossil fuel than if the grocery store were nearby.
