- Cows and grass have evolved to become mutual partners.

- Grass provides food for cows. In return, cows eat shrubs and small trees that compete with grass. They also fertilize the grass with their manure.

- Cows have a second stomach called a rumen. They are one of the few animals that can digest grass.

- Cows are now given corn to eat because corn makes cows grow at a faster rate than grass, so they can be slaughtered sooner.

- However, the cow’s rumen cannot digest corn.

- Corn-fed beef is tasty and is considered higher quality, but it is actually less healthy for cows and humans.

- Corn-fed beef has more saturated fat, which is unhealthy fat for humans. Grass-fed beef contains the kind of fat that is healthy for humans to consume.

**Pages 229–231**

- Humans evolved to eat wild animals. Chickens and cows that eat grass and roam are healthier for humans, and their milk and eggs are healthier to eat.

- These grass-fed animals contain healthy chemicals like beta-carotene, vitamin E, and folic acid.

- They also contain a good balance of healthy fats, omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids. However, corn-fed animals do not have a good balance of these healthy fats.

- Corn-fed meat may explain the high levels of heart disease among humans. It may not be meat that is unhealthy but the food these animals consumed that is unhealthy for humans to eat.
