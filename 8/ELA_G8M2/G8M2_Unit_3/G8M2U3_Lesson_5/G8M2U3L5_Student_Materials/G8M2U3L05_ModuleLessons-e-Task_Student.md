Write a Practice Argument Essay

Throughout this unit, you will work with a partner to plan and write an essay that relates to the background and task explained below.

**Background and Task**

You recently went to a health fair sponsored by the state health commission and listened to presentations on the various choices people make as meat eaters. The health council has made a recommendation that when they are eating meat, consumers should choose to purchase grass-fed beef instead of corn-fed beef. During the presentation, the health council explained the benefits of choosing grass-fed beef for both an individual’s health and the health of the environment. Some people at the health fair feel that grass-fed beef is too expensive and the benefits are not significant enough to warrant the price. However, the recommendation the health council is pursuing says that consumers should make every effort to purchase grass-fed beef in order to more positively impact their own health and the health of the environment.

Your job is to write an essay that defends this recommendation. Be sure you give at least two reasons to support your claim about grass-fed beef, use evidence from the text as you do so, and explain your reasoning. You should also take into account the people who disagree with what you think, and keep a very professional tone in your proposal.

You will create a plan for the practice essay during Lesson 5, and have time to write the essay in partners during Lessons 6–10.

**REMEMBER: A well-written argument essay**

- introduces and clearly states a main claim;

- provides logically ordered reasons that are supported by evidence;

- links the claim and reasons using words and phrases;

- identifies a counterclaim and distinguishes this from the main claim;

- provides a conclusion that restates and reflects on the argument presented;

- and follows the rules of writing (spelling, punctuation, and grammar).
