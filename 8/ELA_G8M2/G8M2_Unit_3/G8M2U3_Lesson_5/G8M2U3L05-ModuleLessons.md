Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.8.1 – Work Time A: Students complete an entrance ticket, providing supporting reasons for claims about real-world contexts.

- W.8.1 – Work Time A: Students read the Practice Argument Essay directions and identify evidence that can be used to answer the prompt.

- W.8.4 – Work Time A: Students read the practice essay prompt and analyze the task’s purpose and intended audience, considering how they will organize their ideas to produce clear and coherent argument writing.

- R.8.1 – Work Time B: Students read a section of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* and identify evidence that supports the prompt in their practice argument essay.

- W.8.1 – Work Time C: Students work in pairs to plan an argument supported by claims with clear reasons and relevant evidence.

- W.8.5 – Work Time C: Students work in pairs to plan a practice argument essay.

- In this lesson, students read the directions for their practice argument essay, read a new section from *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, and create a plan for their practice argument essay.

- In this lesson, students work to become effective learners, focusing on a goal within collaboration that will support their practice work as they plan their essay.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release those students who are ready, to read and analyze the section from *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* independently and then move on to planning their practice essay.

- Students can generate arguments for other topics and issues that interest them. Arrange an informal debate in which students can practice supporting arguments with evidence and reasoning.

- Challenge students to add a third point to support their arguments in the practice essay.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students analyzed the structure of a model argument essay using the Painted Essay® template. In this lesson, students choose specific content for each part of the structure as they create a plan for their practice essay. Students continue to read *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* and cite evidence from the text to answer the essay prompt.

Support All Students

- For Lessons 5–10, students will work with the same partner on a practice argument essay. Provide differentiated mentors by purposefully preselecting student partnerships, especially for ELLs. Meet with the mentors in advance to encourage them to share their thought processes with their partners. ▲

- Note there is a differentiated version of the Practice Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer used in Work Time C in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Varied approaches may be taken for the practice essay, depending on class make-up and needs. While the ultimate goal is for students to gain practice with the genre and deeper understanding of how to write an argument essay prior to the assessment, the way partners support each other can take on the needs of a particular class. Have students plan and write together, using their partners for oral rehearsal, feedback, or evidence gathering. Alternatively, have students write independently and engage in peer feedback. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson begins with an entrance ticket that invites students to consider effective collaboration and independent goal-setting, pairs students to plan and write an argument essay, and allows time for reflection and collaborative discussion. Students are introduced to the practice essay task and begin working together to plan and write an argument essay on a new topic. This collaborative work will prepare students to write an argument essay independently for the End of Unit 3 Assessment. Developing compelling and valid reasons that support the main claim is a critical aspect of this planning, and ultimately, of a successful argument essay. Owing to the important nature of this work, students will generate the reasons with a partner in guided practice, rather than completely independently. As a result, students will all write using the same reasons to support their claim in their essay.

- ELLs may find it challenging to condense their thoughts, articulate their ideas, and fill in all of the information on the Practice Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer. Spend time discussing the assignment and prompt to ensure that students have a clear understanding of the task. Allow ample time for oral processing before students begin writing in their planners.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.C.11 and 8.I.C.12.

Assessment Guidance

- Use the Grade 8 Writing Process checklist to assess students’ writing abilities in Work Time C (see the Tools page at http://eled.org/tools).

- In Work Time A, check for student understanding of the context and prompt in the practice essay directions. Use any misconceptions or common issues as teaching points in upcoming lessons when students write this essay in more detail.

- Throughout Work Time C, frequently review student work to ensure they are using the planning graphic organizer accurately. Use common issues as whole group teaching points.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will begin their practice essays on grass-fed beef. They will use the criteria and plans they develop in this lesson, to draft their practice essays in Lessons 6–10, which will prepare them to independently plan and draft a new argument essay in the end of unit assessment in Lessons 11–12.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.8.1 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **3**, **Lesson** **5**.

- Once all students are ready, invite them to use their answers on the Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 5 to engage in a Think-Pair-Share with the following questions:

“What reason did you give for why Florida is the ideal vacation spot for families?” (Responses will vary, but may include: the mild climate, beaches, and attractions like Disney World make it appeal to all ages.)

“How do these reasons support the claim?” (Responses will vary, but may include: the reasons give examples of why Florida may be considered an ideal family vacation spot.)

- If time permits, use a total participation technique and invite responses to other questions on the entrance ticket from the group, asking them to share out. Use the **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **3**, **Lesson** **5** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as needed.

Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

- During Opening A, use a Conversation Cue to prompt students to paraphrase what their partner said during the discussion about goals (e.g., “Who can repeat what your classmate said?”; “Who can tell us what your classmate said in your own words?”). This will help students to practice restating ideas in their own words, and hearing others relay what they have shared will promote thoughtful consideration of the goals students have set around collaboration.

Work Time

A. Introduce the Practice Essay Prompt – W.8.4 (5 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can annotate and determine the gist of a practice essay prompt.”

- Explain to students that they will work in pairs to practice writing an argument essay and will write another essay independently for the end of unit assessment.

- Display and distribute **Practice** **Argument** **Essay** **directions**. Explain that this handout describes background on the essay topic, what their essay should include, and the resources they need to complete the task in the upcoming lessons.

- Read each section of the handout aloud, and instruct students to read along silently. Then, direct students to read the Practice Argument Essay directions once more, on their own.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What is the gist of the Practice Argument Essay directions?” (Students should identify that their practice essay refers back to their anchor text, The Omnivore’s Dilemma, and examines one food choice that consumers can make, eating grass-fed beef. The directions for the practice essay ask students to write an essay that explains a recommendation being made to a health council that consumers should make every effort to purchase grass-fed beef in order to more positively impact their own health and the health of the environment. They need to give at least two reasons to support the proposal, or claim; use evidence from the text; and explain their reasoning. They should also write and refute a counterclaim.)

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What is the topic of the essay you will write?” (Responses should identify that their job is to write an essay that supports the proposal, or claim, that all consumers should make every effort to purchase grass-fed beef in order to more positively impact their own health and the health of the environment.)

- Explain to students that the main claim of the essay has been provided for them to help them focus their planning and writing on the other aspects of an argument essay. Having everyone support the same claim allows students to collaborate and discuss their writing and thinking more easily on this practice piece.

- Using a total participation technique, invite responses from the group. Answer any questions and clear up any misconceptions or concerns students have regarding the task.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Work Time

B. Read *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 10, and Identify Evidence – RI.8.1 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can read excerpts from *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* in order to locate evidence for a practice essay.”

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What information does the prompt give us about the context of the practice essay?” (Responses will vary, but may include: healthy choices for meat eaters, the benefits of grass-fed beef compared to corn-fed beef, the suggestion that consumers purchase grass-fed beef for its health and environmental benefits.)

“How does this context relate to the main idea we have been studying about food choices?” (Responses will vary, but may include: it identifies how eating beef is a part of the “omnivore’s dilemma,” shows that people have many food choices, and that these choices are complicated.)

- Ask students to retrieve their copies of ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma*** and turn to page 63. Tell students that reading this section of the text will familiarize them with the content and inform their practice essay work. Portions of this section will be reviewed, yet students should reread them with the context of the practice essay in mind.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same process as with previous lessons for students to read section 10 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* using the **Text** **Guide**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma*** (**for** **teacher** **reference**). Instruct students to read the sections independently, and support struggling students as needed. If students do not finish reading the sections within the allotted reading time, distribute **Synopsis**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma,*** **Section** **10** to each student to review the key details from the section. As time permits, have students identify the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary, reflect on their reading as they choose, and record the gist on **sticky** **notes** using the following resources as appropriate: vocabulary logs, **academic** **word** **wall**, and **Work** **to** **Become** **Effective** **Learners** **anchor** **chart**.

- Distribute more sticky notes, and ask students to work with a partner to identify evidence in this section of text that is relevant to the main claim that “One of the most important things we can do to ensure that our food is healthy and sustainable is to make the choice to buy grass-fed beef.” Tell students that although they haven’t yet identified the reasons supporting the main claim, finding relevant evidence will ultimately help them to determine and name those reasons. Direct students to capture their evidence on the sticky notes and check with their partner to ensure it is relevant to the main claim.

- Ask students to share the evidence they selected and noted with their partner.

- Circulate as students share to support them in identifying relevant evidence. Prompt struggling students to support them in identifying evidence from the book.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time B, as students read the excerpt from *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, record and display key events from the text that students will want to reference in their essays. Use the Practice Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer (example for teacher reference) as a guide for which events to highlight. Students can refer back to this list as they work together to plan their partner essays.

Work Time

C. Plan Practice Argument Essay – W.8.5 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can use my understanding of the elements of an argument essay to create a plan for a practice essay.”

- Display and distribute the **Practice** **Argument** **Essay** **Writing** **Plan** **graphic** **organizer**.

- Remind students that they used a similar graphic organizer to plan their informative essays in Module 2, Unit 2. As necessary, review each section, asking volunteers to explain what kind of information they will write in each section. For ELLs and students who require additional support, the **Practice** **Argument** **Essay** **Writing** **Plan** **graphic** **organizer** ▲ can be used to help guide students’ thinking with prefilled information, examples, and sentence frames.

- Display the **Characteristics** **of** **Argument** **Writing** **anchor** **chart**.

- Ask:

“What is the difference between planning an informative essay and an argument essay?” (The focus statement in an argument essay is called a main claim, and the elaboration in the argument essay will connect the evidence to the reasons given for supporting the proposal, so it is called reasoning. Argument essays contain a counterclaim paragraph.)

- Explain to students that they will use the Practice Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer to plan their essay. In this lesson, they will roughly sketch out what will go into each paragraph. In the upcoming lessons, they will have more time to add details to this graphic organizer as they plan and draft their practice argument essay.

- Tell students that, as they plan, they should remember to support their ideas with information from *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, going back into the text as needed.

- Draw students’ attention to the focus question section at the top of the Practice Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer. Ask students to copy the focus question from the Practice Argument Essay directions to this space. Refer to the **Practice** **Argument** **Essay** **Writing** **Plan** **graphic** **organizer** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) for sample responses.

- Prompt students to Turn and Talk with their partners, allowing time for students to fill in the appropriate sections of their graphic organizers:

“What is the main claim of your argument?” (Responses will vary.)

“What context or background information will you need to give readers so they can understand this claim? Consider terms your readers might need defined.” (Responses will vary.)

- Refer to the Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer (example for teacher reference) for sample responses.

- As students write, circulate and ensure they understand the prompt and the main claim given in the directions.

- Distribute **colored** **pencils**, and invite students to use them to underline their main claim with the correct color: green.

- Direct students to the section of their Practice Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer where it asks, “What are the two main reasons/points you will be offering to support this claim?”

- Explain to students that in an argument essay, it is important to identify valid and compelling reasons that support the main claim. If students struggle to understand the concept of reasons, prompt them to consider times in their own lives when they give reasons to support an argument (e.g., when asking a parent or teacher for permission to do something).

- Tell students that a *reason* basically answers the question “why?” <u>Why</u> is this claim important or true? Often, a reason uses the word *because*, as in the statement: “this claim is important or true *because* . . . .” Remind students that they saw examples of this kind of thinking in Model Essay: “Transportation Choices.”

- Ask students to brainstorm with their partner, to generate potential reasons that would emerge from the evidence and support the given claim: “One of the most important things we can do to ensure that our food is healthy and sustainable is to make the choice to buy grass-fed beef.” Give students time to briefly discuss and brainstorm with one another.

- As students discuss, chart or record any ideas they have come up with.

- Tell students that the class will focus on the same two compelling reasons to use in supporting the claim of this essay:

- “Reason/Point 1: First, consumers should purchase grass-fed beef because it is a better choice for their own health.”

- “Reason/Point 2: In addition, eating only grass-fed beef matters because it is better for our farms and environment. It is a more sustainable system.”

- Turn and Talk:

“What is the meaning of the word *sustainable*?” (Sustainable means causing little or no harm to the environment; being able to continue for a long time. Or, in Pollan’s definition, “a closed loop, recycling fertility and using renewable energy.”)

- Direct students to record the reasons on their planning organizer, and reiterate that the rest of their planning for their essay should be aligned to these reasons.

- Release students to complete the rest of their Practice Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizers in pairs. Remind students that they should use evidence from *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* for examples to explain their points/reasons. Also, explain that students don’t need to write complete sentences in their graphic organizer; they can just take notes.

- Circulate to support students as they plan. Refer to the Practice Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer (example for teacher reference) as needed. If necessary, prompt by asking questions such as:

“Why does choosing grass-fed beef matter? What does this evidence say about the health or environmental benefits of grass-fed beef?”

“What other choices might a health council recommend? How will you defend the choice of grass-fed beef?”

- Assure students that they will have more time to add detail to this plan as they work to write each paragraph in the piece over the next few lessons.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target and the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time C, before students begin planning their partner essays, have them fill out the Practice Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer for Model Essay: “Transportation Choices.” This will give students the opportunity to further dissect the structure, content, and argumentation of this model essay, which will help students to better understand how to plan and organize their own essay on a new topic.

- During Work Time C, invite students who need heavier support to use the Practice Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer▲. This resource features prefilled information and sentence frames to guide students through the planning process. Working with this differentiated version of the graphic organizer will set students up for success in planning their independent essays on the End of Unit 3 Assessment.

Closing and Assessment

A. Reflect on Learning (5 minutes)

- Organize students into groups of three or four, and have them read the Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart.

- Ask students to Turn and Talk in their groups about successes and challenges they had working collaboratively in the class session.

- Use the following Goal 3 Conversation Cues as appropriate to prompt discussion:

“Why do you think that?”

“What examples from today’s class makes you think so?”

- Prompt students to create a goal for the next class session regarding effective collaboration. Direct students to share these with their groups.

- Call on students to share their goals for the next lesson and reflect on any changes they may need to make in order to meet these goals.

For Lighter Support

- As students reflect on their learning, use the same process from Opening A by asking students to paraphrase a partner’s contribution to the discussion using appropriate Conversation Cues. This will help to reinforce both the content and purpose of these tasks and discussions and will provide students with additional practice in reframing information in their own words, a skill that they will also apply as they cite evidence in their essays.
