*Background and Task*

W.8.1a Topic clearly and concisely introduced with background information. Previews the complicated considerations involved in making decisions about eating meat before stating claim.

W.8.1a Introduces clearly stated claim and organizes points with a main claim statement about grass-fed beef.

You recently went to a health fair sponsored by the state health commission and listened to presentations on the various choices people make as meat eaters. The health council has made a recommendation that when they are eating meat, consumers should choose to purchase grass-fed beef instead of corn-fed beef. During the presentation, the health council explained the benefits of choosing grass-fed beef for both an individual’s health and the health of the environment. Some people at the health fair feel that grass-fed beef is too expensive and the benefits are not significant enough to warrant the price. However, the recommendation the health council is pursuing says that consumers should make every effort to purchase grass-fed beef in order to more positively impact their own health and the health of the environment.

Your job is to write an essay that defends this recommendation. Be sure you give at least two reasons to support your claim about grass-fed beef, use evidence from the text as you do so, and explain your reasoning. You should also take into account the people who disagree with what you think and keep a very professional tone in your proposal.

***Sample Response for Teacher Reference***

As food consumers, people have a lot to think about. People need to eat, yet there are so many options to navigate as they make choices about the food they purchase and eat. They have to think about where the food comes from and whether or not to eat a vegetarian, vegan, or omnivore diet. They also need to think about the impact of their food choice on their health and the health of the environment. These choices can be complicated! For people who decide to eat meat, it’s helpful to think about how that animal has been raised. Having considered the options, it is obvious that one of the most important things we can do to ensure that our food is healthy and sustainable is to make the choice to buy grass-fed beef.

First, consumers should purchase grass-fed beef because it is a better choice for their own health. While most beef comes from corn-fed cattle, grass-fed beef is a healthier option. Cows, and other animals that eat grass, gain important nutrients that are essential for both animals and humans. Pollan tells us that “green grass has large quantities of beta-carotene, vitamin E and folic acid. These natural chemicals are important for a healthy diet” (Pollan, 229). Animals that are allowed to eat a diet of grass, rather than corn, will have a high level of these nutrients, and humans who ingest the meat of these animals will benefit from the nutrients. It’s also known that grass-fed beef contains higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids. These are considered healthier fats for humans to eat. “Corn-fed beef” says Pollan, “contains more saturated fats than the meat of grass-fed animals. Too much saturated fat has been linked to heart disease and other health problems” (Pollan, 71). All of this means that eating grass instead of corn makes healthier cows. When people eat grass-fed beef, they are eating healthier meat, so they in turn are more healthy. Looking at all of the health benefits that come from eating grass-fed beef, it is clear that it’s the better choice.

W.8.1b Claim shows an understanding of the topic, is supported by reasons and evidence from accurate credible sources, and shows understanding of benefits of grass-fed beef.

W.8.1d Establishes and maintains a formal style with formal phrases instead of colloquial phrases.

W.8.1b Supports point with relevant evidence such as quotes from the text and reasoning that explains the evidence.

W.8.1c Uses phrases like “All of this means . . .” to clarify the relationship between ideas.

In addition, eating only grass-fed beef matters because it is better for our farms and environment. It is a more sustainable system. Over time cows and grasses have evolved to create a successful ecological system. For example, cows that graze and eat grasses (instead of being confined) don’t kill the plants. Cows can even protect the habitat by eating shrubs and trees that would compete with the grasses. The cow also spreads grass seed and fertilizes it with manure (Pollan, 65). This system benefits the cow and its grazing land, and promotes a healthy ecosystem. In addition to the beneficial relationship, grass-fed beef is far better for the environment. “The animals’ wastes drop onto the land, becoming nutrients for the next cycle of crops. In feedlots and other forms of factory farming, however, the animals’ wastes build up in enormous quantities, becoming a staggering source of water and air pollution” (foodrevolution.org). All of this means that eating grass-fed beef is part of a sustainable system. The environment can remain healthy. Animals, plants, and people can thrive without harmful chemicals. For people who eat meat, consuming grass-fed beef is a win-win. Not only is it the best choice for an individual but also for farms and the environment overall.

Some might say that grass-fed beef isn’t a realistic choice. They might argue that it is more expensive and doesn’t have drastic health benefits that are worthy of the cost. It’s certainly true that grass-fed beef may be more costly in some areas of the country because it takes longer to grow cattle on grass than on corn. However, eating grass-fed beef rather than corn-fed beef does not have to be more expensive. Corn-fed beef is cheaper because of all the government policies that support growing corn (foodrevolution.org). These policies benefit large agribusiness, not farmers. If more consumers start demanding grass-fed beef in their local grocery stores, lawmakers may begin to listen to change those policies. They could even pass laws that help support the grass-fed beef industry. This would mean that corn-fed beef would no longer be so cheap, and grass-fed beef would be more affordable.

Overall, even though many different food options are available for meat eaters, the choice that rises to the top is selecting grass-fed beef whenever possible. People in our community will not only see health benefits from this choice, but they will be investing in farms that help create a more sustainable world.

W.8.1c Uses transitions to move from one idea to the next. Evidence and elaboration show how the claim and counterclaim reasons and evidence are related.

W.8.1a Acknowledges evidence that counters claim and explains its validity, while further elaborating on the benefits and relevance of claim.

W.8.1e Conclusion restates argument and includes thinking about the importance of choosing grass-fed beef and the benefits of this choice.
