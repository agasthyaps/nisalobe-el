Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.8.1 – Opening A: Students preview the argument essay prompt they will address in the end of unit assessment, and brainstorm possible actions citizens can take to make healthy and sustainable food choices.

- W.8.1e – Work Time A: Students use the Painted Essay® structure to more closely analyze a model conclusion, annotating sentences and aligning them to the organizational structure of a conclusion paragraph.

- W.8.1e – Work Time B: Students work in pairs to draft their conclusion, restating their main claim and providing additional reflection on the topic.

- W.8.4 – Work Time B: Students work in pairs to produce clear and coherent writing as they develop the conclusion of their practice essay.

- W.8.5 – Work Time B: Student partners provide support to each other as they draft the conclusion to their practice essay.

- W.8.5 – Closing and Assessment A: Students receive and provide feedback to strengthen all aspects of their practice essay draft.

- In this lesson, students use their Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer to write a conclusion to add to the introduction and Proof Paragraphs of their essays, and therefore complete the essay. (W.8.1)

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners, showing perseverance as they independently write.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release those students who are ready, to read and analyze the model conclusion independently and then move on to drafting the conclusion to their practice essay with a partner rather than with teacher modeling.

- Provide examples of effective conclusions from other argument essays or informational essays. Invite students to read a variety of conclusions and debrief with partners and as a whole group, having a synthesis discussion of how to write a strong conclusion.

- Have students review the conclusions to the informational articles used in Unit 2 with the class. Invite students to annotate the elements of the strong conclusion, provide a title, and illustrate the conclusion in poster form, and hang these exemplar conclusions around the room.

- Invite students to form pairs. Using a set of argument or informational conclusion paragraphs, have students choose the paragraph that they find particularly strong. Invite students to share their notices with a partner. Have them switch partners and share a few times.

- An optional Mini Language Dive, intended for use after students analyze the conclusion of the model essay in Work Time A, is available in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the second half of this unit, students have been analyzing a model and using their analysis to draft the introduction, Proof Paragraphs, and counterclaim of their practice essay. This lesson continues those routines to guide students in writing and planning their conclusion paragraphs.

Support All Students

- For Lessons 6–10, students work with the same partner on a practice argument essay. Provide differentiated mentors by purposefully preselecting student partnerships. Meet with the mentors in advance to encourage them to share their thought processes with their partners. ▲

- While students continue, since Lesson 6, completing their own written version of the practice essay, consider the variety of ways that partnerships can support students in helping one another to more deeply understand the genre of argument writing and successfully complete their work. Choral reading, peer planning, shared writing, shared evidence gathering, clarifying tasks, varying scribing responsibilities, editing support, etc., are all possible roles partners can play for each other in these lessons. ▲

- Students may have limited argument writing experience and be unfamiliar with strong conclusion paragraphs. Providing examples and scaffolded support (sentence stems, transitional words, annotated graphic organizers, models of conclusion paragraphs, and additional opportunities to talk through their ideas) will help their writing. ▲

- Students may need additional support while writing their conclusion paragraphs. Group these students for a discussion to guide them through creating their conclusion in a step-by-step manner. ▲

- Pull small instructional groups who need more scaffolding and support and extended verbal processing time to develop their reasoning statements. ▲

- Consistently referring to the model argument essay will act as a support for students who need reminders of what strong writing looks like. ▲

- Providing written and verbal directions, and charting the steps they will take on an anchor chart, could help students as they plan for their writing. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson follows a sequence that closely mirrors that of previous lessons, which will help students to focus on the tasks at hand. Students analyze the conclusion of the model essay and then draft conclusions for the practice argument essay. During Closing and Assessment A, students give one another feedback. This offers an opportunity for supportive learning, as well as meaningful oral skills practice.

- ELLs may find it challenging to articulate their thoughts on Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 10. ELLs may also find it difficult to write a strong conclusion, depending on the strength of the rest of their essays. Prioritize discussion and peer feedback portions of the lesson to build a supportive environment for students as they take on this work. Remind students to be respectful of one another’s progress, and invite students to offer suggestions and feedback that is kind, helpful, and specific.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.C.11 and 8.I.C.12.

Assessment Guidance

- Use the Grade 8 Writing Process checklist to assess students’ writing abilities in Work Times B and C (see the Tools page at http://eled.org/tools).

Down the Road

- In Lessons 11–12, students plan and draft an argument essay for their End of Unit 3 Assessment.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 10 (one per student), and ensure there is a copy at each student’s workspace.

- Review the Argument Writing checklist to become familiar with what will be required of students over the remainder of the unit.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time C: Prepare devices with word-processing capabilities for students to continue drafting.

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous modules to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Introduce the Assessment Essay – W.8.1 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 10**.

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, prompt them to Think-Pair-Share:

“Summarize the assessment essay task, outlined in the entrance ticket. Restate the task in your own words.” (Students should recognize that they will be writing about food choices, and they need to name one action people in their community can take to make healthy and sustainable food choices.)

“What possible actions did you brainstorm on the entrance ticket? Which one will you most likely write about in your assessment essay?” (Responses will vary.)

“How will the work you have done in your practice essay prepare you for this assessment?” (Responses will vary, but should mention that they have practiced every component of an argument essay with their partner, and analyzed a model in detail, which should help them write independently to a new prompt.)

Work Time

A. Analyze a Model: Strong Conclusions – W.8.1e (5 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify the purpose of each part of the conclusion paragraph of a model argument essay.”

- Invite students to refer to their **Painted Essay® template** to remember the parts of a conclusion paragraph:

- Restated Main Claim

- Reflection

- Direct students to retrieve their **Model Essay: “Transportation Choices,”** and ask them to circle the restated claim and underline any further reflection.

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What role does the ‘further reflection’ play in a conclusion?” (The “what” of the conclusion provides thoughts on the importance of the main claim. The “so what” of the conclusion might leave the reader with a compelling last question, idea, or call to action on the topic.)

“What ideas do you have for the ‘further reflection’ in the conclusion you will write for your practice essay?” (Responses will vary.)

- Invite students to help record the parts of a conclusion on the **Characteristics** **of** **Argument** **Writing** **anchor** **chart**. Refer to the **Characteristics** **of** **Argument** **Writing** **anchor** **chart** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as necessary.

For Lighter Support

- After Work Time A, invite students to participate in a Mini Language Dive in small groups to explore how a concluding statement in Model Essay: “Transportation Choices” restates a claim (W.8.1e). This Mini Language Dive also gives students the opportunity to explain the function of a gerund in a particular sentence (L.8.1a).

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time A, after students have analyzed the conclusion from the model essay, display two additional, alternative versions of this conclusion—one that’s been further improved with increased transition words, new punctuation, nuanced vocabulary, and coordinating conjunctions, and one with significant issues and errors with content as well as transition words, the use of commas, and the use of gerunds and infinitives (to further build upon students’ work throughout the module and unit with these language structures). Invite students to discuss the characteristics of each conclusion and to identify strengths and weaknesses of each one. To extend this further, have students revise the weak conclusion.

Work Time

B. Practice Essay: Rehearse and Write a Conclusion – W.8.1e (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can write the conclusion of my practice argument essay.”

- Discuss the following criterion on the **Argument** **Writing** **checklist**, adding to the Characteristics column as needed, and answering any questions about the role of the conclusion in an argument essay.

- W.8.1e: “I have a conclusion that follows from and supports my argument.”

- Prompt students to gather their **Practice** **Argument** **Essay** **Writing** **Plan** **graphic** **organizer**.

- Invite students to review their graphic organizer to remind them of their claim, reasons, and evidence. Remind students that it is often helpful to verbally rehearse the words they will use before they write.

- Guide students through the following series of Turn and Talks, giving them time to orally process each question below with their partner, as they refine plans for their conclusion:

What: “How will you restate the main claim?” (Responses will vary.)

So What: “How will you reflect on why this claim is significant?”

“Why is it so important for people to think about how the beef they eat is raised?” (Responses will vary.)

“What lasting impact will choosing grass-fed beef have on health and the environment?” (Responses will vary.)

“What is the ‘takeaway’ message you want your reader to have?” (Responses will vary.)

“What do you want your reader to do with this information?” (Responses will vary.)

- Invite students to retrieve their **devices**, gather any remaining materials from the list below, and refer to the Characteristics of Argument Writing anchor chart as they write:

- Model Essay: “Transportation Choices”

- Argument Writing checklist

- Painted Essay® template

- ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma***

- Practice Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer

- Tell students they are now ready to draft the conclusion of their practice essay. Remind students that as they draft the conclusion, they should restate the main claim (the “what” of their essay) and provide a reflection (the “so what” of their essay).

- Circulate to support students as they write and to identify common issues to use as whole group teaching points.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- After Work Time B, invite students to code their practice essay according to the Painted Essay® format. This can serve as a way of reviewing the content and structure in preparation for the sharing ahead in Closing and Assessment A, as well as for the writing that will take place during the End of Unit 3 Assessment in Lessons 11–12.

Closing and Assessment

A. Peer Feedback: Practice Essay – W.8.5 (20 minutes)

- Invite students to pair up with a new partner to share their practice essays, and provide feedback against the following criteria from the Argument Writing checklist:

- W.8.1b, L.8.6

- W.8.1a

- W.8.1e

- Tell students that they will read their partner’s entire practice essay, noting feedback on **sticky** **notes**.

- Invite pairs to discuss the following questions:

“What is a strength of the essay?”

“What is one area for improvement?”

“How will you address the area(s) of improvement?”

- Circulate and monitor interactions to ensure each student reads his/her partner’s essay and notes feedback aligned to the criteria.

- Invite students to record “Y” for *Yes* and the date in the final column of their Argument Writing checklist if they feel the criteria marked on their checklists have been achieved in their writing in this lesson.

- Allow time for students to capture any final notes and to revise their practice essay, as needed, based on feedback.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson in their work to be respectful partners, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Revise Practice Essays

- Students revise their practice essay, based off of criteria and feedback received in Closing and Assessment A.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent** **reading** **journal**.
