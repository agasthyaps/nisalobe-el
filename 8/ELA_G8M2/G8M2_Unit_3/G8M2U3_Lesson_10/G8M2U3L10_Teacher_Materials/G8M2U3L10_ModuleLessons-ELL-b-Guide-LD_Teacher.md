5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

W.8.1e, L.8.1a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

Individuals in our community will not only save money by **taking advantage of public transportation,** but as they travel from day to day they will also invest in creating safer and more well-planned cities and towns. (from paragraph 6 of Model Essay: “Transportation Choices”)

**Lesson 10 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after students have analyzed the conclusion for the model essay in Work Time A.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target (**I can identify the purpose of each part of the conclusion paragraph of a model argument essay**) and W.8.1e by presenting an opportunity for students to analyze the concluding statement in an argument essay and how it follows from the argument presented. This sentence also helps students to address W.8.1c, as it contains linking language, and L.8.1a, as it contains a gerund phrase. Note that this Mini Language Dive builds on work with infinitives in the optional Mini Language Dive in Lesson 6. Supporting Standard: W.8.1c

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses a gerund phrase with the purpose of restating the main claim of an essay.

- Transfer: gerund + object used to restate an essay’s claim in the concluding statement of an argument essay during the End of Unit 3 Assessment.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **Individuals in our community will not only save money by <u>taking advantage of public transportation,</u> but as they travel from day to day they will also invest in creating safer and more well-planned cities and towns.**

- Ask:

“What is this sentence about?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **taking advantage of public transportation**

- Ask:

“Can you figure out the meaning of taking advantage in this chunk?” (to use and enjoy the benefits)

“What is another meaning of taking advantage?” (to treat someone unfairly by using their kindness or generosity in a sneaky or selfish way)

Structure: “What do you notice about the language structure in this chunk?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to notice that this is a gerund phrase \[verb + -ing + object\].  
As needed, remind students of the work they have done with gerunds in other Language Dives and Mini Language Dives throughout the module.)

Function: “Is this gerund phrase functioning as a noun, an adjective, or an adverb? How do you know?” (It’s functioning as a noun. Gerunds always function as nouns. We know this because it follows a preposition.)

Purpose: “How does this chunk connect to the focus statement of the essay?” (It revisits the main claim that people should use public transportation.)

- Invite students to highlight this chunk in green to reinforce Painted Essay<sup>®</sup> color-coding.

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **Individuals in our community will not only save money by <u>taking advantage of public transportation,</u> but as they travel from day to day they will also invest in creating safer and more well-planned cities and towns.**

- Ask:

“Can you find another gerund phrase in this sentence?” (creating safer and more well-planned cities and towns)

“How does this gerund phrase connect to the focus statement of the essay? (It restates the second main point.)

- Invite students to color-code the gerund phrase in blue to reinforce Painted Essay<sup>®</sup> color-coding.

“Can you figure out where the writer restates the first point of the essay in this sentence?” (save money)

- Invite students to color-code the phrase in yellow to reinforce Painted Essay<sup>®</sup> color-coding.

“Can you figure out why the writer would restate his or her main claim and points in the concluding statement of the essay?” (to emphasize the argument that he/she is making and to leave the reader with a clear sense of the action he/she wants them to take)

“How can you use gerund phrases in your own writing?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all replies.)

- Encourage students to refer back to the essay’s focus statement and Proof Paragraph topic sentences, as needed.

“How can you use gerund phrases in your own writing?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all replies.)

- Ask:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does this Mini Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target: I can identify the purpose of each part of the conclusion paragraph of a model argument essay”? (Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

> **Consumers will not only pay less by \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, but they will**
>
> gerund phrase restating main claim
>
> **also get more nutritional value from their food.**
>
> (restatement of point 1 + restatement of main claim + restatement of point 2 = concluding statement)
>
> (verb + **-ing** + object = gerund phrase)

- Say:

“Use this main claim about GMOs to write a sentence for the conclusion of an essay.”

> Main Claim: People should eat GMO foods.
>
> Responses will vary, but may include:
>
> **Consumers will not only pay less by <u>eating GMOs</u>, but they will also get more**
>
> gerund phrase
>
> restating main claim
>
> **nutritional value from their food.**
>
> (restatement of point 1 + restatement of main claim + restatement of point 2 = concluding statement)
