5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

W.8.1a, W.8.1c, L.8.1a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

Once these considerations have been taken into account, it will be clear the best transportation choice that members of our community can make is **to use public transit.** (from paragraph 2 of Model Essay: “Transportation Choices”)

**Lesson 6 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after students have analyzed the introduction for the model essay in Work Time A.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target (**I can write the introduction of my practice essay, giving context on the issue and clearly stating my claim**) and W.8.1a and W.8.1c by presenting an opportunity for students to analyze the focus statement of an argument essay. This sentence introduces the topic and includes a linking clause that connects the focus statement of the essay to the rest of the introduction. The sentence also helps students to address L.8.1a, as it contains an infinitive phrase.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses an infinitive phrase with the purpose of introducing the main claim in the focus statement of an essay.

- Transfer: **to** + verb = infinitive used to introduce a main claim in the focus statement of an essay during the End of Unit 3 Assessment.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **Once these considerations have been taken into account, it will be clear the best transportation choice that members of our community can make is <u>to use public transit</u>.**

- Ask:

“What is this sentence about?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **to use public transit**

- Ask:

“What do you notice about the language structure of this chunk?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to notice that this is an infinitive + object = infinitive phrase. As needed, remind students of the work they have done with infinitives in other Language Dives and Mini Language Dives throughout the module.)

“How does this infinitive phrase help to introduce the main claim of the model essay?”  
(This infinitive phrase tells us what action the writer will argue that people should take.)

“Is this infinitive phrase functioning as a noun, an adjective, or an adverb? What questions can we ask to find out?” (It’s functioning as a noun. We can ask whether this infinitive is describing something else \[adjective, adverb\] or if it represents an activity \[noun\]. We can also test this by forming a question from this sentence with the words what \[noun\] and how \[adjective, adverb\]: ‘What is the best transportation choice that members of our community can make?’ and ‘How is the best transportation choice that members of our community members make?’. Through these tests, we discover that to use public transit is a noun because it represents an activity and can be replaced by the word what in a question.)

- Test to see if an infinitive is functioning as a noun:

“What is the best transportation choice?” (To use public transit is the best transportation choice.)

- Test to see if an infinitive is functioning as an adjective or adverb:

“How is the best transportation choice?” (This question can’t be answered, which tells us this is not an adjective or adverb.)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **Once these considerations have been taken into account, it will be clear the best transportation choice that members of our community can make is <u>to use public transit</u>.**

- Ask:

“What claim is the writer introducing in this sentence?” (that community members should use public transportation)

“What if we remove the first part of this sentence Once these considerations have been taken into account?” (The sentence still makes sense, but we lose the cohesion between the focus statement of the essay and the information that comes before it in the introduction. Once and have been taken help create sequence and time relationships from the previous sentence; these considerations refers back to the considerations.)

- Encourage students to refer back to the introduction and focus statement of the essay, as needed.

“How can we use linking language in our own essays?” (Responses will vary, but help students to recognize that linking language can be used to create cohesion and to show the connection between ideas.)

- Ask:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target: I can write the introduction of my practice essay, giving context on the issue and clearly stating my claim?” (Responses will vary.)
