**Sentence**

The nitrogen runoff **has created a “hypoxic,” or dead, zone in the Gulf** that is as big as the state of New Jersey—and still growing. (from page 45 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* by Michael Pollan)

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: To help students to address the daily learning target (**I can recognize the differences among connotations of words with similar meanings in *The Omnivore’s Dilemma***) and L.8.1c, this sentence contains two synonyms with different connotations. The sentence also helps to address L.8.4a and L.8.5b, as it provides an opportunity for students to use context and the relationships among words to better understand individual words and phrases, and L.8.2a, as it contains a dash used to indicate a pause before introducing important information. Supporting Standards: L.8.4c, SL.8.1

- Guiding Question: To help students respond to the guiding question (**What factors influence our access to healthy food?**), this sentence contains information about how food production impacts our ecosystem.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses two synonyms with different connotations, both with the purpose of describing the effects of nitrogen runoff. It also contains a dash used with the purpose of indicating a pause before providing important additional information.

- Invite students to discuss each chunk briefly, but encourage extended conversation and practice with the focus structure: **has created a “hypoxic,” or dead, zone in the Gulf**. Based on students’ needs and time, consider adding days for extended conversation and practice with a new focus structure: **—and still growing**.

- Practice and Transfer: After discussing the focus structure, students practice using it to discuss something in their lives. Students transfer their understanding of the meaning and structure of this sentence when answering questions about language during the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment, and when writing argument essays during the End of Unit 3 Assessment.

**Time**

10 minutes

Throughout the Language Dive

Refer to the instructions provided in the first three Language Dives of Module 1.

Deconstruct

- Invite students to put their finger by this sentence from *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* on their note-catchers: **The nitrogen runoff <u>has created a “hypoxic,” or dead, zone in the Gulf</u> that is as big as the state of New Jersey—and still growing.**

- Read aloud the sentence twice, and then ask students to take turns reading aloud the sentence with their partners.

- Ask:

“What does this sentence mean to you?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“How does this sentence add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

The nitrogen runoff

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following sentence chunk: **The nitrogen runoff**

- Ask:

“What do you already know about nitrogen from The Omnivore’s Dilemma?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to recall information from the section of the text they read in the previous lesson, particularly pages 40–44.)

- Invite students to retrieve their copies of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*. Invite students to reread the sentence that comes just before the Language Dive sentence on page 45 of the text.

- Ask:

“Can you use the previous sentence as context to figure out what runoff means? How do you know?” (Runoff means the draining away of something, usually water. The information that comes before this sentence on page 45 of The Omnivore’s Dilemma provides context for understanding this word, including: spring rains wash it off; flood of extra nitrogen.)

has created a “hypoxic,” or dead, zone in  
the Gulf

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **has created a “hypoxic,” or dead, zone in the Gulf**

- Ask:

“What does this chunk tell us?” (This chunk tells us about an effect of nitrogen runoff.)

- Ask:

“Can you figure out which words in this chunk are synonyms? How do you know?” (Hypoxic and dead are synonyms. We know this because, after the writer says hypoxic, he uses the word or to suggest a more familiar alternative: dead.)

“Which noun do these adjectives describe?” (zone)

“What do you think a dead zone is?” (Responses will vary, but help students understand that a dead zone is a location with no activity. Consider offering a location with no cell-phone signal as an example of a dead zone to help students understand the concept.)

“Can you figure out how the words hypoxic and dead differ?” (Hypoxic is a scientific term with a more formal connotation. Dead is more informal.)

- As time allows, invite students to consult an online dictionary or scientific glossary to look up the word **hypoxic** to verify its exact meaning.

- Ask:

“Why do you think Pollan included two synonyms with different connotations to describe zone?” (to help the reader understand the meaning of hypoxic, a scientific word that most people probably do not already know, and to make the tone of his writing more accessible and informal)

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Display the sentence frame:

**Synthetic, or \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, nitrogen changed the way we grow food.**

adjective

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use a dictionary to find a simpler synonym for the word synthetic, and complete the sentence with that word.”

that is as big as the state of New Jersey

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **that is as big as the state of New Jersey**.

- Ask:

“How does this chunk help us better understand the dead zone caused by nitrogen runoff?” (It tells us about the size of the zone to help us better understand its impact.)

- Say:

“I’ll give you a moment to think and sketch. Draw a dead zone that is as big as the state of New Jersey in the Gulf of Mexico on your note-catchers.” 

- Display a map of North America, and point out New Jersey and the Gulf of Mexico to help students carry out this task.

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ sketches. 

—and still growing.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **—and still growing.**

- Ask:

“How does this chunk help us understand the dead zone created by the nitrogen runoff?” (It tells us that it’s getting bigger.)

“Can you figure out why the writer used a dash to indicate a pause before and and the adjective phrase still growing?” (to help the reader understand that it’s important information)

“Why is it important for the reader to know that the dead zone is getting bigger?”  
(to understand that the impact of nitrogen runoff is a growing problem)

The nitrogen runoff has created a “hypoxic,” or dead, zone in the Gulf that is as big as the state of New Jersey—and still growing.

Reconstruct

- Point to and read the entire sentence on display: **The nitrogen runoff <u>has created a “hypoxic,” or dead, zone in the Gulf</u> that is as big as the state of New Jersey—and still growing.**

- Ask:

“What if we remove the dash before and still growing?” (The meaning stays the same, but we lose the effect of the dash, which creates a pause that indicates the information to follow is important.)

- Display the sentence with the dash removed. Invite students to take turns alternating between reading the original sentence and the sentence with the dash removed, and invite them to notice the pause generated by the dash and how it highlights the importance of the information that follows it.

- Ask:

“What other questions can we ask that will help us understand this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does this Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

> **Researchers have discovered that GMOs are helpful in extending the shelf life of food—**
>
> **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

adjective phrase

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use this frame to talk about GMOs in your own words with your partner. Add a phrase after the dash that conveys important information about the impact of extending the shelf life of food.”

- As needed, provide the phrase starters below for students to use to complete the sentence:

> **and increasing . . .**
>
> **and changing . . .**
>
> **and giving us . . .**

- Note that, like the Language Dive sentence, the sentence students complete using this frame will contain an **-ing** participle adjective phrase. Students may wonder if these **-ing** words are gerunds. Remind them that not all **-ing** words are gerunds and that, unlike gerunds, these **-ing** words are functioning as adjectives rather than as nouns.
