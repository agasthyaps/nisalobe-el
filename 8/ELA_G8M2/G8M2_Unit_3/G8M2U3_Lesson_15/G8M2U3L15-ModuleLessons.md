Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- SL.8.4 – Work Time A: Students present claims and findings about healthy and sustainable food choices in their roundtable presentations, emphasizing salient points in a focused, coherent manner with relevant evidence, sound valid reasoning, and well-chosen details.

- SL.8.5– Work Time A: Students use their visual display to clarify information, strengthen their claims and evidence, and add interest.

- SL.8.6 – Work Time A: Students speak about healthy and sustainable food in their roundtable presentations, adapting their speech to their task, purpose, and audience and using formal English where appropriate.

- L.8.6 – Work Time A: Students use academic and domain-specific vocabulary as they verbally present their research findings.

- In Work Time A, the habit of character focus is on working to contribute to a better world. Students will focus on how their presentations can help improve the world.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Students may also create or use additional visual displays like graphs, diagrams, and slides for their roundtable presentations.

- Inviting authentic audience members can enhance students’ roundtable presentation experience and develop their speaking and listening skills. Invite parents/guardians, teachers, school leaders, community members, local farmers, and farm-to-table restaurant owners.

- Students may not be able to visit each roundtable of guests within the allotted time. Extend the roundtable presentations to a two-period or two-day event so that students can present to more guests and guests can view more presentations.

- Students can record their presentations to distribute electronically to friends, family, or community members.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In Lessons 11–12, students wrote an argument essay for their end of unit assessment about healthy and sustainable food choices. In Lesson 13, students created an infographic to organize key points from their essay. And in Lesson 14, students created prompt cards to present their claims to classmates in a 3-minute speech. In this lesson, students present their claims in roundtable presentations to an authentic audience to culminate their performance task.

Support All Students

- Students may be apprehensive about sharing their work in a presentation to an audience. Allow time for oral rehearsal of presentations. ▲

- Although students are asked not to read directly from their prompt cards, for those students who struggle with language, multitasking, cognitive processing, and other challenges, reading from the prompt cards can be beneficial. ▲

- Students may struggle to answer audience members’ questions about their infographic. Prepare students by providing sample questions that their audience may ask during the roundtable presentations. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson celebrates the learning that students have done throughout the module. Students are supported to deliver individual presentations to make recommendations for how consumers can make healthy and sustainable food choices. Students review the Work to Contribute to a Better World anchor chart to consider how the topic and the work they have done promote habits of character.

- ELLs may find it challenging to speak in front of an audience, as this may cause some students to feel self-conscious about their work and their English-language proficiency levels. Remind students of discussion norms and habits of character to maintain an atmosphere of support and respect as students share and listen. At the end of the class, congratulate students on their hard work throughout Unit 3 and the entire module, and celebrate everyone’s progress and successes.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.C.9 and 8.I.C.10.

Assessment Guidance

- Review student work during and after the lesson either to provide specific feedback/suggestions or to identify common issues that could be used as whole group teaching points on developing speaking and listening skills.

- Circulate to ensure each station has a small number of audience members to prevent the forming of crowds at one roundtable.

Down the Road

- This is the final lesson of Module 2. In the next module, students will work with a new module topic.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare Performance Task: Guest Exit Ticket for audience members (enough for one per guest).

- Organize the room into roundtables or clusters for attendees so that students may seamlessly visit each roundtable and present. Distribute the number of chairs at each table so there is an even number of guests at each roundtable. Ensure there are two to four students at each roundtable for each round of presentations.

- Post the learning targets and Performance Task anchor chart.

Technology and Multimedia

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous modules to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Review Performance Task Anchor Chart (5 minutes)

- Display the **Performance** **Task** **anchor** **chart**. Read aloud the overall directions at the top of the chart, and the criteria for an effective infographic and presentation, to review the context and purpose of the roundtable presentations.

- Turn and Talk:

“What is the purpose of these roundtables?” (to inform people about recommendations for making healthy and sustainable food choices and why it is important to do so)

“What is the purpose of the visual you’ve created?” (to help audience members understand my argument and recommendation as they listen to the presentation)

- Encourage students, reminding them that they are experts on their topic and to confidently explain their findings to their audience.

- Display the **Work** **to** **Contribute** **to** **a** **Better** **World** **anchor** **chart**. Remind students that, as it says at the top of the chart, students learn to improve their communities.

- Ask a volunteer to read aloud the habit of character recorded:

- “I apply my learning to help our school, the community, and the environment.”

- Invite students to Turn and Talk to an elbow partner:

“What does this habit look like? What might you see when someone is showing this habit?”

“What does this habit sound like? What might you hear when someone is showing this habit?”

“How do you think creating a presentation on healthy and sustainable food choices helps you work on this habit?” (Responses will vary, but may include: Creating this presentation can help others learn about food choices and how they can better their health and the environment. It can help us think deeply about the importance of this topic.)

“What might audience members do with this information to help them in their lives?” (Responses will vary, but may include: be more aware of the foods they buy for themselves and others, choose healthier alternatives to the unhealthy foods they eat, prioritize the purchase of healthy food, vote for sustainable food policies.)

- Remind students that, similar to the web pages they created in Module 1, the roundtable presentations give them the opportunity to apply their learning to help better the world, specifically the food choices people make.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review the learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

- Thank guests for attending, and welcome them to evenly spread around the room and find a roundtable. Split students into groups, and assign them to one of the roundtables in the room.

Work Time

A. Roundtable Presentations – SL.8.4, SL.8.5, SL.8.6, L.8.6 (35 minutes)

- Review the learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can clearly present my recommendation for consumers to consider when making healthy and sustainable food choices.”

“I can use appropriate eye contact, adequate volume, and clear pronunciation when presenting my claims and findings.”

- Tell the audience that students are prepared at each roundtable to present their research and findings that answer the question: “What one informed action can people in your community take to make healthy and sustainable food choices?” Make clear that students have worked long and hard and are prepared to present their arguments.

- Direct students’ and guests’ attention to the visual/audio **timer**. Explain that each student at each roundtable has 3 minutes to present his or her **infographic** to guests. Remind students they may reference their **prompt** **cards** as needed during their presentations.

- When time is up, students will move clockwise to a new roundtable to present their infographics to a new group of attendees. If time permits, students will be able to visit every roundtable. Tell guests that they may ask students about their research, claims, and infographic-making process within their allotted 3 minutes.

- Instruct students to begin.

- Circulate as students present. Ensure that students are engaging with their audience coherently and are making eye contact. For struggling students, visit their roundtables more than once to check in and offer support as needed. If using a visual-only timer, give verbal warnings after each 3-minute interval to prevent students from running out of time and to ensure that each student at each roundtable has enough time to present. After Round 1 is complete, instruct students to move clockwise to the next roundtable and present to a new group of attendees. Repeat with subsequent rounds.

- After all presentations have completed, invite audience members to join you in a round of applause for all presenters. Invite guests to complete the **Performance** **Task**: **Guest** **Exit** **Ticket** as they leave, and say goodbye to the guests.

For Lighter Support

- As Module 2 comes to a close, put student names into a container of some kind, and have each student pull a random name. Ask each student to identify and publicly share one learning victory that they recognize in the peer whose name they randomly selected. This will help to set a positive, supportive tone for the lesson and may help to reduce any trepidation students have about sharing their work in Closing and Assessment A.

For Heavier Support

- Before students deliver their presentations, provide them with specific presentation skills to focus on during their presentation. For example, saying each word clearly and carefully, or using domain-specific vocabulary. These can be tailored to individual students’ strengths and areas for growth.

Closing and Assessment

A. Reflect on Learning Targets (5 minutes)

- Refocus the whole class.

- Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the learning targets, using a checking for understanding technique—for example, thumbs-up or traffic-light signal cards. Scan student responses, and make a note of students who might need support. Check in with them moving forward.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

- Ask and give students 1 minute to think before inviting volunteers to share with the whole group:

“What was a highlight of this presentation for you? Why?” (Responses will vary.)

- If productive, cue students to expand the conversation by giving an example:

“Can you give an example?” (Responses will vary.)

- Using the Performance Task: Guest Exit Tickets, give students specific, positive feedback on their presentations. Filter the guest feedback as appropriate to be kind, specific, and helpful. (Example: “I heard a lot of you speaking at an appropriate pace and volume to be clearly understood.”)

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent** **reading** **journal**.
