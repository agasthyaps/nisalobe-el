End of Unit 3 Assessment: Write an Argument Essay: Defending a Healthy Food Choice

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Prompt: What is one informed action people in your community can take to make healthy and sustainable food choices?**

**Directions:** Over the course of this module, you have learned that the way food is grown and processed impacts our health, nutrition, and the environment. This is a complicated issue, and it is often challenging to know what priorities we should hold when making choices about the food we eat. However, as a community, we want to be able to make informed decisions so that our food supply is healthy and sustainable.

Use what you have learned in this module to write an argument essay, explaining your opinion on the question: **“What is one informed action that people in your community can take to make healthy and sustainable food choices?”** In this assessment you will plan and draft your essay. In your essay, explain your reasons for recommending this action, supporting your argument with relevant and sufficient evidence from credible sources.

Use the provided planner prior to drafting your essay. Be sure to include a relevant main claim and to support your claim with reasons and evidence, drawing on what you learned by writing your practice essay. When you have finished drafting, your piece should be a full essay that is several paragraphs long. (W.8.1, W.8.4, W.8.6, W.8.10, L.8.1, L.8.2, L.8.6)

Use all rows on the Grade 8 Argument Writing rubric and the sample response below to assess student writing. Save a copy of the scored essays to use as a baseline assessment. These pieces can be used to measure the progress of individual students throughout the year, as well as to identify common instructional needs in a class.

Food is a critical aspect of our lives. We need food to keep us healthy. It is what allows us to grow and be strong. Without food, we simply could not survive. Yet, the food we consume, where it comes from, and our access to it are complicated issues. We can buy food that is organic, or grown by conventional methods. We can purchase food directly from a farmer, from a small local store, or from a large supermarket chain. Some people don’t even have adequate food choices nearby and must rely on corner stores with limited healthy options. The choices we make around food have an impact on our health and the sustainability of our environment. When it comes to making choices about the food we purchase and consume, there are many factors to consider, and many actions we can take. After considering all of the possibilities, it is easy to see that one of the most important things we can do to ensure that our food is healthy and sustainable is to make the choice to buy organic food.

Choosing organic food makes sense because it is better for our health. Organic foods are grown without pesticides, herbicides, or chemical fertilizers. Research shows that certain chemicals can be dangerous to our health. In 1990, the Alar food scare prompted people to start eating organic food. Alar was being sprayed on apples. The EPA found that the Alar was causing cancer (Pollan 136). This frightened many people, so they started buying healthier, organic food. Another study, from three generations of women in California, linked pesticides to an increase in breast cancer. According to *National Geographic*, “Women exposed in the womb to high levels of the pesticide DDT have a nearly fourfold increased risk of developing breast cancer” (Konkel, 2015). Although Alar is no longer used, and DDT was banned in 1972, other chemicals remain in use. We don’t always know what the long-term effects of these chemicals are. We do not have to take risks like this with our food. Organic food is healthier for humans because it is made from ingredients that aren’t grown using chemicals. Our community needs to choose food that does not cause possible long-term health effects, like cancer. Organic food is a better choice for our own health.

In addition, choosing organic food is a good idea because it can help ensure that we continue to have a safe and healthy environment in the future. When food is treated with chemicals, some of those chemicals end up in the water supply. Not using chemicals in the growth of organic food “means no toxic run-off into rivers and oceans” (Pollan 141). In the long run, all of us depend on a healthy environment. It is better for humans, animals, and farms when fewer damaging chemicals are released into ecosystems. Organic farming “builds healthy soil, protects pollinators and promotes biodiversity, and reduces water contamination” (NRDC). Because organic farmers work to preserve soil, rotate crops, and keep fields healthy, they are keeping the environment healthy and productive for future crops and animals. This means they are sustainable. If more farms went organic, we would have a significantly healthier environment. This means healthier food, both now and in the years to come.

One might say that advising people to eat organic food is not helpful because it is more expensive than non-organically produced food. Since so many people in our society struggle to make ends meet, they cannot afford to buy organic food. It is certainly true that the cost of organic food is a challenge. However, recommending organic food still makes sense. If more people are demanding organic food, it seems likely that more farmers will produce it. This could make the cost come down. In addition, our state and federal governments could also enact policies that make the cost of organic food lower for people who can’t afford it. So, the benefits of recommending organic food, in the long run, outweigh the very real concern about cost.

W.8.1c Uses phrases to clarify

the relationship among ideas.

W.8.1c Uses transitions that move the text from one idea to the next. Evidence and elaboration to show how the claim and counterclaim reasons and evidence are related.

W.8.1a Acknowledges evidence that counters claim and explains its validity, while further elaborating on the benefits and relevance of claim.

W.8.1d Establishes and maintains a formal style with formal phrases as opposed to colloquial phrases.

W.8.1e Conclusion restates argument and includes thinking about the importance of choosing organic food and the benefits of this choice.

Overall, the choices we make around food hold a lot of power. As more people choose organic food, it will likely become more affordable and accessible. Having more organically raised crops on our farms will make our farms healthier and help ensure that we have a strong food supply in the future. Eating more organically grown food will decrease health risks in the people we love. By spending money on organic food, we are sending the message that we want a healthier community, both now and in the future. When it comes to making choices about food, it’s critical that we use our voices to choose organic.
