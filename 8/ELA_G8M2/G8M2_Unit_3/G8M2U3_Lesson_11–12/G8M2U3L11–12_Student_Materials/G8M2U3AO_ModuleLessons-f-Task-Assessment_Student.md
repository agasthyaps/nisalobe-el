End of Unit 3 Assessment: Write an Argument Essay: Defending a Healthy Food Choice

**Name:** **Date:**

**Prompt: What is one informed action people in your community can take to make healthy and sustainable food choices?**

Write and Plan Your Argument

**Directions:** Over the course of this module, you have learned that the way food is grown and processed impacts our health, nutrition, and the environment. This is a complicated issue, and it is often challenging to know what priorities we should hold when making choices about the food we eat. However, as a community, we want to be able to make informed decisions so that our food supply is healthy and sustainable.

Use what you have learned in this module to write an argument essay, explaining your opinion on the question: **“What is one informed action that people in your community can take to make healthy and sustainable food choices?”** In this assessment you will plan and draft your essay. In your essay, explain your reasons for recommending this action, supporting your argument with relevant and sufficient evidence from credible sources.

Use the provided planner prior to drafting your essay. Be sure to include a relevant main claim and to support your claim with reasons and evidence, drawing on what you learned by writing your practice essay. When you have finished drafting, your piece should be a full essay that is several paragraphs long. (W.8.1, W.8.4, W.8.6, W.8.10, L.8.1, L.8.2, L.8.6)

**REMEMBER: A well-written opinion essay**

- introduces and clearly states a claim;

- provides logically ordered reasons that are supported by facts and details;

- links your opinion and reasons using words and phrases;

- identifies a counterclaim and distinguishes this from the main claim;

- provides a conclusion that restates and reflects on the claim presented; and

- follows the rules of writing (spelling, punctuation, and grammar).
