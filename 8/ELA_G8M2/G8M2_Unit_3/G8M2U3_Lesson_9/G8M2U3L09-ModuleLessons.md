Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.8.1b –Opening A: Partners read and give feedback on the reasoning and evidence used in the Proof Paragraphs of their partner essay.

- W.8.1e – Work Time A: Students closely analyze a model counterclaim, reviewing the function of sentences and aligning them to the organizational structure of a counterclaim paragraph.

- W.8.1a – Work Time B: Students participate in a Language Dive in which they consider how a sentence distinguishes reasoning that supports the main claim from a counterclaim.

- W.8.1c – Work Time B: Students participate in a Language Dive in which they explore how a word (*However*) is used to connect the counterclaim and the author’s main claim in an essay.

- L.8.5b – Work Time B: Students participate in a Language Dive in which they analyze a cause and effect relationship between events in the sentence to better understand meaning.

- W.8.1a – Work Time C: Students work in pairs to draft their counterclaim of their practice essay.

- W.8.4 – Work Time C: Students work with partners to produce clear and coherent counterclaim paragraphs, anticipating questions the reader may have.

- W.8.5 – Work Time C: Student partners provide support to each other as they clearly communicate the counterclaim to their practice essay.

- SL.8.4 – Work Time C: Students present their ideas for their counterclaims to a partner, and as they recount their writing, determine if they have relevant evidence and sound reasoning, then make a plan to enhance their writing.

- W.8.5 – Closing and Assessment A: Students develop and strengthen writing by reading their counterclaim aloud and providing feedback to strengthen the counterclaim of their practice essay.

- In this lesson, students use their Practice Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer and the introduction and Proof Paragraphs of their essays to support the writing of the counterclaim in their practice essay. (W.8.1)

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners, showing perseverance as they independently write.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release those students who are ready, to read and analyze the model counterclaim independently and then move on to drafting the counterclaim to their practice essay with a partner.

- Challenge students to generate additional counterclaims with refutations for Model Essay: “Transportation Choices” for additional practice with acknowledging conflicting viewpoints.

- Allow students to develop and craft counterclaims for other situations relevant to their life experiences inside and outside of school to practice the skill of writing counterclaims.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the second half of this unit, students have been analyzing a model and using their analysis to draft the introduction and Proof Paragraphs of their practice essay and to plan these aspects of their assessment essay. This lesson continues those routines to guide students in writing and planning their Proof Paragraphs.

Support All Students

- Consider the variety of ways that partnerships can help students to more deeply understand the genre of argument writing and successfully complete their work. Choral reading, peer planning, shared writing, shared evidence gathering, clarifying tasks, varying scribing responsibilities, editing support, etc., are all possible roles partners can play for each other in these lessons. ▲

- Students may have limited argument writing experience and be unfamiliar with strong counterclaim paragraphs, as it is a skill introduced for the first time in Grade 8. Provide students with examples and scaffolded support (sentence stems, transitional words, annotated graphic organizers, multiple models of counterclaim paragraphs, and additional opportunities to talk through their ideas). ▲

- Prior to orally rehearsing their counterclaim in Work Time C, model this exchange for students. Prompt two students to verbally rehearse the sentences they will use when writing to help all students gain a vision of how a rehearsal can support their writing process.

- Students may need additional support while writing their counterclaim paragraphs. Group these students for a discussion to guide them through the Practice Essay Counterclaim note-catcher in a step-by-step manner. ▲

- Note there is a differentiated version of the Practice Essay Counterclaim note-catcher used in Work Time A in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Pull small instructional groups who need more scaffolding and support and extended verbal processing time to develop their reasoning statements. ▲

- Consistently referring to the model argument essay, and analyzing carefully to see how it is structured and the tone that it uses, will act as a support for students who need reminders of what strong argument writing looks like. ▲

- Providing written and verbal directions, and charting the steps they will take on an anchor chart, could help students as they plan for their writing. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson includes a Language Dive on a sentence that introduces a counterclaim in the model essay. Students will have already seen this sentence in the previous lessons while reading and analyzing the model essay. In the Practice portion of this Language Dive, students begin drafting a sentence for the counterclaim paragraph of their own essays. After the Language Dive, students will directly transfer what they have learned and practiced while writing the practice argument essay.

- Students may find it difficult to understand the structure of a counterclaim paragraph and struggle to form a coherent counterclaim in their essays. Prioritize the collaborative portions of the lesson to ensure that students are receiving appropriate support and that they are able to discuss and ask questions as they become more familiar with this element of an essay. The oral rehearsal portion of Work Time C may be especially beneficial for ELLs.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.C.11, 8.I.C.12, 8.II.A.1, and 8.II.A.2.

Assessment Guidance

- Use the Grade 8 Writing Process checklist to assess students’ writing abilities in Work Times B and C (see the Tools page at http://eled.org/tools).

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will write the conclusion of their practice essay. Students complete an independent argument essay during their End of Unit 3 Assessment in Lessons 11–12.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.8.1b (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **3**, **Lesson** **9**.

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, prompt students to join a peer other than their practice essay peer and label themselves Partner A and Partner B.

- Using their **Practice** **Argument** **Essay** **Writing** **Plan** **graphic** **organizer** and any other documentation from their practice essay, ask students to follow these directions:

- Partner A reads the Proof Paragraph they wrote aloud to their new partner.

- Partner B gives feedback regarding the following two criteria from the Argument Writing checklist:

<!-- -->

- W.8.1a: “My reasons and evidence are organized logically, in a way that is easy to follow.”

- W.8.1b: “I support my claim with logical reasoning and relevant evidence.”

<!-- -->

- Partner B reads the Proof Paragraph they wrote aloud.

- Partner A gives feedback regarding the two criteria mentioned above.

- Gather students together, and, using total participation techniques, ask them to respond to the following questions:

“What makes a strong Proof Paragraph?” (The reason supporting the main claim should be clear, and the reason should be explained with relevant evidence and logical reasoning, giving the reader further insight on the argument and its importance.)

“How did your partner’s reasoning emphasize the importance of their main claim?” (Responses will vary.)

- As students share, track any new information regarding successful Proof Paragraphs on the **Characteristics** **of** **Argument** **Writing** **anchor** **chart**. Refer to **Characteristics** **of** **Argument** **Writing** **anchor** **chart** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as necessary.

Work Time

A. Analyze a Model: What Is a Counterclaim? – W.8.1a (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify the purpose of each part of the counterclaim paragraph of a model argument essay.”

- Display and instruct students to retrieve their copies of **Model** **Essay**: “ **Transportation** **Choices**.” Tell students that they will look at an important aspect of good argument writing—including a counterclaim.

- Remind students that argument writing involves working with a question that is complicated and that the writer needs to do a lot of thinking about both sides of an issue before making a claim that he or she thinks is the best answer to the question.

- Remind students of all the thinking they have done about food choice considerations during Units 1 and 2 of this module.

- Explain that the writer of an argument knows that other people, who may also have thought carefully about the issue, might come to a different claim. Explain that this means that part of writing one’s own argument is to address that thinking, and still develop one’s own position, which is the counterclaim.

- Direct students to look at their copy of the Model Essay: “Transportation Choices.” Prompt students to put their finger on the main claim of the essay.

- Read the counterclaim aloud as students read along silently.

- Turn and Talk:

“How does including this counterclaim section make the essay stronger?” (It shows the reader that the writer has really thought about this, shows that the writer knows deeply what he/she is talking about, and recognizes that the issue is complicated.)

- Distribute and display the **Practice** **Essay** **Counterclaim** **note** - **catcher**. For ELLs and students who require additional support, the **Practice** **Essay** **Counterclaim** **note** - **catcher** ▲ can be used to help guide students’ thinking with matching. Refer to **Practice** **Essay** **Counterclaim** **note** - **catcher** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as needed.

- Direct students to read the first chunk of sentences from the model with their partner:

“One might say that public transportation isn’t very convenient. Since so many people in our communities have busy schedules and need to get places quickly, time is a priority. It might also be true that some areas do not have adequate transit options, and making connections would take up lots of time. Using one’s own car to travel seems like the best option.”

- Think aloud and discuss the role of this chunk in the counterclaim. (This section transitions from the second Proof Paragraph, uses cuing language that an alternate claim is being introduced.) Direct students to underline the first three words in the section. (Students underline “One might say.”)

- Turn and Talk:

“Why does the chunk begin with this transition phrase?” (The writer is letting the reader know that he/she is transitioning from the main claim and will be mentioning an alternate claim.)

- Continue working through each chunk of the counterclaim on the Practice Essay Counterclaim note-catcher, pausing to ask students to identify the job of each section of text, and the purpose of the transitional words. Clarify any questions, and use any misconceptions as whole group teaching points.

- Turn and Talk:

“Why does a counterclaim exist in an argument essay, but not in other types of informative writing?” (In an argument essay, there is often more than one reasonable claim. Writers can strengthen the claim they have chosen by acknowledging alternate claims and then refuting them, because the writer is trying to convey the importance of her main claim. In other types of writing, writers are not trying to argue a point, so there is no need to counter an argument.)

“How would you describe the tone of this counterclaim? What makes you think so?” (The writer crafts a counterclaim that is respectful of other ideas on the topic. The writer is also careful not to claim too much. Using words like *may, seems,* and *it’s likely* helps him/her convey a tone of respectful consideration of other ideas, while also solidifying his/her own claim. All of this is important because the writer understands that this is a complicated issue.)

- Invite students to help record or check the parts of a counterclaim on the Characteristics of Argument Writing anchor chart. Refer to Characteristics of Argument Writing anchor chart (example for teacher reference) as necessary.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- For further practice with the concept of a counterclaim, after the activity in Work Time A, display or distribute a list of everyday scenarios that students can come up with counterarguments against. Pair students, and have them take turns alternating between making a claim and responding to the claim with a counterclaim. Use the following situations, or create new ones:

1.  One person claims a group of friends should go to the movie theater to see a new film. Another person disagrees and wants to watch an old favorite movie at home.

2.  A parent wants her child to do his homework right after school. The child believes it would be best to take a break to relax and do homework after eating dinner.

3.  A child is claiming that she is ready to have a smartphone and deserves one. Her parents don’t believe this is necessary, and they don’t think she is responsible enough yet.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time A, invite students who need heavier support to use the Practice Essay Counterclaim note-catcher▲. This resource features responses that students can match to the appropriate sentences.

Work Time

B. Language Dive: Model Essay: “Transportation Choices,” Paragraph 5 – W.8.1a (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify the purpose of each part of the counterclaim paragraph of a model argument essay.”

- Tell students they will now participate in a Language Dive to explore how linking language is used to create cohesion between a counterclaim and the author’s argument in an essay. Students will also have the opportunity to use a cause and effect relationship between events to better understand the meaning of the sentence.

- Reread aloud paragraph 5 of the Model Essay: “Transportation Choices.”

- Focus students on the sentence:

- “However, if more people use public transportation, it seems likely that the frequency of service will increase.”

- Use the **Language** **Dive** **Guide**: **Model** **Essay**: “ **Transportation** **Choices**,” **Paragraph** **5** (**for** **teacher** **reference**) to guide students through a Language Dive conversation about the sentence. Distribute and display the **Language** **Dive**: **Model** **Essay**: “ **Transportation** **Choices**,” **Paragraph** **5** **note** - **catcher** and the **Language** **Dive**: **Model** **Essay**: “ **Transportation** **Choices**,” **Paragraph** **5** **sentence** **chunk** **strips**.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Work Time

C. Practice Essay: Rehearse and Write a Counterclaim – W.8.1a (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can write the counterclaim of my practice essay.”

- Discuss the following characteristic on the displayed **Argument** **Writing** **checklist**, adding to the Characteristics column as needed, and answering any questions about the role of the counterclaim in an argument essay. Refer to **Argument** **Writing** **checklist** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- W.8.1a: “I fairly acknowledge claims that are different from my own and explain why my claim is still valid.”

- Prompt students to review their Practice Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer.

- Ask:

“What are the main claim and points of the practice essay?” (The main claim is that consumers should buy grass-fed beef. The two points that support this are that it is healthy and good for farms and the environment.)

“What would be a reasonable counterclaim to this claim and these points?” (Responses will vary.)

- Instruct students to orally rehearse their counterclaim paragraph with their partners. Direct partners to use the cues located on the bottom of their Practice Essay Counterclaim note-catcher to formulate ideas.

- Tell students they are now ready to draft the counterclaim of their practice essay. Remind students that as they draft this counterclaim paragraph, they should strengthen their main claim by acknowledging an alternative claim, and explaining its validity, while refuting it and further elaborating on the benefits and relevance of their own claim.

- Invite students to retrieve their **devices**, gather any remaining materials from the list below, and refer to the Characteristics of Argument Writing anchor chart as they write:

- Model Essay: “Transportation Choices”

- Argument Writing checklist

- **Painted** **Essay** ® **template**

- ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma***

- Practice Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer

- Practice Essay Counterclaim note-catcher

- Circulate to support students as they write and to identify common issues to use as whole group teaching points.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Closing and Assessment

A. Peer Feedback: Practice Essay Counterclaim – W.8.5 (5 minutes)

- Invite students to find a partner other than their predetermined partner for their practice essay.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What does it mean to ‘fairly acknowledge claims’?” (Responses will vary, but may include: to recognize that the goal of a counterclaim is not simply to explain why their idea is best, but also to fairly weigh additional ideas.)

“Why does this criterion say ‘fairly’ instead of just ‘acknowledge’ claims?” (A writer knows that those who disagree with him/her may still have merit to their claim, and when they address these merits, they need to use language that is respectful and fair.)

- Prompt students to read their counterclaims aloud and provide feedback to one another according to this criterion:

- W.8.1a

- Invite students to record “Y” for *Yes* and the date in the final column of their Argument Writing checklist if they feel the criteria marked on their checklists have been achieved in their writing in this lesson. Remind students to revise their counterclaim.

- As time permits, use Goal 3 Conversation Cues. Help students deepen their thinking by collecting responses from the class regarding their classmates’ ability to fairly acknowledge alternate claims, by asking questions like:

“How did your partner fairly acknowledge an alternate claim in their counterclaim?” (Responses will vary.)

“Why do you think that?” (Responses will vary.)

“What sentence in their counterclaim makes you think so?” (Responses will vary.)

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson in their work to be respectful partners, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Revise Counterclaims

- Students revise the counterclaim of their practice argument essay, based off of criteria and feedback.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent** **reading** **journal**.
