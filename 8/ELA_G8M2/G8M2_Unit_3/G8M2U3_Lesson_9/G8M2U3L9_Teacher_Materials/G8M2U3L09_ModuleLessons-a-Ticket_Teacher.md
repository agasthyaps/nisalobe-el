Sample completed task for teacher reference:

First, consumers should purchase grass-fed beef because it is a better choice for their own health. <u>While most beef comes from corn-fed cattle, grass-fed beef is a healthier option. Cows, and other animals that eat grass, gain important nutrients that are essential for both animals and humans. Pollan tells us that “green grass has large quantities of beta-carotene, vitamin E and folic acid. These natural chemicals are important for a healthy diet” (Pollan 229). Animals that are allowed to eat a diet of grass, rather than corn, will have a high level of these nutrients, and humans who ingest the meat of these animals will benefit from the nutrients. It’s also known that grass-fed beef contains higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids. These are considered healthier fats for humans to eat. “Corn-fed beef,” says Pollan, “contains more saturated fats than the meat of grass-fed animals.  
Too much saturated fat has been linked to heart disease and other health problems” (Pollan 71).</u> \[All of this means that eating grass instead of corn makes healthier cows. When people eat grass-fed beef, they are eating healthier meat, so they in turn are more healthy.\] Looking at all of the health benefits that come from eating grass-fed beef, it is clear that it’s the better choice.
