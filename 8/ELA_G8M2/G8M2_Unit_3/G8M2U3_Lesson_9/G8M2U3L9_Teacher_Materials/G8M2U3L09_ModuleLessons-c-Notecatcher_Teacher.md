<td><u>One might say</u> that public transportation isn’t very convenient. Since so many people in our communities have busy schedules and need to get to places quickly, time is a priority. It might also be true that some areas do not have adequate transit options, and making connections would take up lots of time. Using one’s own car to travel seems like the best option.</td>
<td><p>What job is this chunk of the paragraph doing?</p>
<p>(B.) <strong>introduces an alternate claim and explains it fairly</strong></p>
<p>Underline the first three words. Why does the chunk begin with this transition phrase?</p>
<p><strong>It signals that there is another way of thinking about this issue, which means it is about to mention an alternate claim (the potential inconvenience of public transit, or the inadequate public transportation options, and the incompatibility of this with busy schedules).</strong></p></td>

<td><u>It is certainly true</u> that travel time is an important factor when it comes to transportation choices.</td>

<ol type="A">
<li><p><strong>acknowledges fairly the validity of the counterclaim</strong></p></li>

<p>Underline the first four words. Why does the chunk begin with this transition phrase?</p>
<p><strong>It signals that there is some truth in the alternate claim (of travel time being an important factor).</strong></p></td>

<td><u>However</u>, if more people use public transportation, it seems likely that the frequency of service will increase. New routes will appear over time, with closer connections. Once there are more buses and trains running, and more routes, public transportation will take less and less time. It may even take less time than driving.</td>
<td><p>What job is this chunk of the paragraph doing?</p>
<p>(D.) <strong>refutes the counterclaim by explaining its limitations</strong></p>
<p>Underline the first word. Why does the chunk begin with this transition phrase?</p>
<p><strong>It shows there is going to be an exception to the alternate claim. The word <em>however</em> signals alternate information is about to be presented, and this is when the writer then fairly discusses the flaws in this claim.</strong></p></td>

<td><u>So</u>, over time, choosing public transportation will quite possibly be the most convenient option.</td>

<p>(C.) <strong>reviews the importance of the original claim</strong></p>
<p>Underline the first word. Why does the chunk begin with this transition phrase?</p>
<p><strong>It tells the reader that the writer is about to conclude an idea.</strong></p></td>
