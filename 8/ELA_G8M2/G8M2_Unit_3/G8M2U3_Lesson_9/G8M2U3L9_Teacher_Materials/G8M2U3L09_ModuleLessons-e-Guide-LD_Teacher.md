Language Dive Guide: Model Essay: “Transportation Choices,” Paragraph 5

W.8.1a, W.8.1c, L.8.5b

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

However, if more people use public transportation, **it seems likely that the frequency of service will increase.** (from paragraph 5 of Model Essay: “Transportation” by EL Education)

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: To help students to address the daily learning target (**I can identify the purpose of each part of the counterclaim paragraph of a model argument essay**) and W.8.1a and W.8.1c by providing an example of a sentence that uses linking language to distinguish a counterclaim from reasoning that supports a claim, creating cohesion within a counterclaim paragraph. The sentence also helps students to address L.8.5b because they can use the cause and effect relationship between two clauses in the sentence to better understand meaning. Supporting Standards: SL.8.1

- Guiding Question: To help students respond to the guiding question (**Given our limitations, what factor\[s\] should we prioritize when making choices about our food?**), this sentence provides a model for the type of reasoning used to discuss factors that impact a decision.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses the adverb **likely** with a **that**-clause with the purpose of indicating possibility. The sentence also expresses a cause and effect conditional relationship. Invite students to discuss each chunk briefly, but encourage extended conversation and practice with the focus structure: **it seems likely that the frequency of service will increase.**

- Practice and Transfer: After discussing the focus structure, students practice using it to discuss something in their lives. Students transfer their understanding of the meaning and structure of this sentence when writing their argument essays during the End of Unit 3 Assessment.

Deconstruct

- Invite students to put their finger by this sentence from the Model Essay: “Transportation Choices” on their note-catchers: **However, if more people use public transportation, <u>it seems likely that the frequency of service will increase</u>.**

- Read aloud the sentence twice, then ask students to take turns reading aloud the sentence with their partners.

- Ask:

“What does this sentence mean to you?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“How does this sentence add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

However,

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following sentence chunk: **However,**

- Ask:

“How does the transition word However clarify the relationship between the information that comes before and after it?” (It shows that the information is in contrast.)

- As time allows, invite students to refer back to the counterclaim paragraph of the model essay to notice the contrast between the Language Dive sentence and the sentence before it.

“Can you think of other linking language that can be used at the beginning of a sentence to indicate contrast with the sentence before it?” (Responses will vary. As needed, offer examples like: On the other hand, Nevertheless, Despite this, That said.)

if more people use public transportation,

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **if more people use public transportation,**

- Ask:

“How does the information in this chunk connect to the writer’s main claim?” (The writer’s main claim is that people should use public transportation. This chunk also talks about people using public transportation.)

- Underline if in green, and invite students to do the same on their note-catchers. 

“What does the conjunction if tell us about more people using transportation?” (that it is uncertain and may or may not happen)

it seems likely that the frequency of  
service will increase.

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **it seems likely that the frequency of service will increase.**

- Ask:

“Can you figure out what frequency of service means?” (how often buses and trains are available for people to use)

“What will happen if the frequency of service increases?” (Buses and trains will be available for people to use more often.)

- Underline seems in red, and invite students to do the same on their note-catchers. 

- Remind students that they looked at the use of the linking verb **seem** in a sentence from the Model Essay: “GMOs” during the Language Dive in Unit 2, Lesson 9.

- Ask:

“What do you know about the verb seem?” (It is a linking verb that tells us the writer believes something is true.)

- Underline likely in yellow, and invite students to do the same on their note-catchers. 

- Ask:

“What does the adjective likely tell us about the clause the frequency of service will increase?” (that it is probable, possible, or expected to happen)

- Underline that in green, and invite students to do the same on their note-catchers. 

- Ask:

“Why do you think the writer included the word that after it seems likely?” (to connect it to the clause the frequency of service will increase)

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Display the sentence frame:

> **It seems likely that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

independent clause

(independent clause + **that** + independent clause = independent clause)

(subject + predicate = independent clause)

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use this frame to talk about your plans for next weekend in your own words with your partners.”

However, if more people use public transportation, it seems likely that the frequency of service will increase.

Reconstruct

- Point to and read aloud the entire sentence on display: **However, if more people use public transportation, <u>it seems likely that the frequency of service will increase</u>**.

- Ask:

“Can you figure out the cause and effect relationship between the events in this sentence? Which event is conditional upon the other?” (There is a cause and effect relationship between people using public transportation more often and more buses and trains becoming available for people to use. If tell us that the second event is conditional to the first.)

- If productive, give an example to cue students to expand the conversation:

“What, in the sentence, makes you think so?” (Responses will vary.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- Ask:

“How does this sentence support the writer’s main claim?” (It provides reasoning to support the idea that more people should use public transportation.)

“Why do you think the writer starts this sentence with However?” (to signal the contrast relationship between the counterclaim and the writer’s own claim)

- As needed, invite students to reread the information in paragraph 5 that precedes this sentence.

- Ask:

“What other questions can we ask that will help us understand this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does this Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, if \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, it seems**

linking language to show contrast independent clause

**likely that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use this frame to write a sentence for the counterclaim paragraph of your essay.”
