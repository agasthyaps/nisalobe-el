![](media/image1.png) Guiding Questions and Big Ideas

The following guiding questions frame the work of this module.

What factors should we prioritize when making choices about our food? How do we share these recommendations with others?

- *Consumers consider many factors when prioritizing food choices. These include but are not limited to: whether to consume GMO foods, how processed the food is, whether it is organic, if pesticides were used in its production, if food deserts played a role in access, and whether high-fructose corn syrup is an ingredient.*

- *When making an argument, it’s critical to provide relevant evidence and reasoning that support the claim made.*

- *When making an argument, it’s necessary to acknowledge alternate, related arguments in order to show that we have considered all perspectives.*

- *In sharing recommendations with others about food choices, we can contribute to building a better world. The choices individual consumers make about food have an effect on society as a whole.*

What will your student be doing at school?

- **Analyze language in *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*:** Students demonstrate their language skills by determining the meanings of unknown words and phrases and showing their understanding of word nuances and the relationship among words. Examples of what this work looks like are below:

- **Exploring Connotations:** Connotations are the idea or feeling that a word invokes in addition to its literal or primary meaning. Students practice distinguishing among the connotations of words with similar meanings in *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*.

<!-- -->

- An example of a question students will be able to answer is: How is the connotation of *launch* different from the connotation of *start*? (*Launch* connotes strong action, motion, and forward momentum. Meanwhile, *start* connotes a simple, straightforward beginning.)

<!-- -->

- **Using context:** Students use context and the relationship among words to better understand the meanings of words and phrases in *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*.

<!-- -->

- An example of a prompt students will be able to respond to is: Describe the meaning of *surplus* in the context of the sentence: “After World War II, the government found itself with a tremendous surplus of ammonium nitrate. There was a debate about what the government should do with the leftover bomb material” (41). (*Surplus* is an amount of something left over when requirements have been met.)

<!-- -->

- **Write an argument essay:** Students spend a series of lessons learning and practicing the skills related to argument writing. In each lesson, they examine an aspect of an argument essay model, and they apply that element in a practice essay. In the end of unit assessment, students write an essay independently, defending a claim about how communities can make healthy food choices. Students draft their argument essay ensuring that it introduces and clearly states an argument, provides logically ordered reasons that are supported by facts and details, connects the argument and reasons using linking words and phrases, provides a conclusion that restates and reflects on the argument presented, and follows the rules of writing (spelling, punctuation, and grammar). Important components of argument writing are explained below:

- **Main Claim:** A claim is the focus of the piece. It names the argument and gives reasons to support the claim. Each reason will be developed into its own Proof Paragraph, containing supporting evidence and reasoning.

- **Evidence:** Students cite evidence that directly supports the reason stated. Evidence should be relevant and sufficient.

- **Reasoning:** Reasoning is the elaboration in each Proof Paragraph that connects the evidence to the reasons given for supporting the argument.

- **Counterclaim:** The counterclaim is a paragraph in the essay that acknowledges an alternate or opposing claim, then further developing and supporting the stated claim.

An example argument essay is shown below:

Transportation Choices

**Prompt:** What is the best mode of transportation for members of our community?

Transportation, and how we move around in our community, is an essential aspect of everyday life. We need to get places easily, safely, and efficiently, and like most modern Americans, we are constantly on the go! When it comes to the best way we can get from one place to another, people have a lot of choices to make. We can ride bikes, take buses or other public transportation, drive cars, participate in car sharing or a carpool, or even walk. Regardless of which modes of transportation one chooses, each has its own pros and cons that should be considered before determining the choice that is best for individuals and their community.

Public transportation makes sense because it is less expensive than other forms of travel. Cars, in particular, are very expensive to own and operate. A 2013 article in *USA Today* states that “on average, the cost of driving 15,000 miles a year rose 1.17 cents to 60.8 cents per mile, or \$9,122 per year” (*USA Today*). Driving a car is expensive in many ways. The driver has to pay for gas, insurance, and maintenance, all on top of the car payment itself. That’s a huge expense. Taking the bus every day costs significantly less than that. So does travelling by train or light rail. A monthly transit pass in Denver, for example, is just \$99, or \$1,200 per year for an individual (RTD Denver). Even for a family of five, that would be significantly more affordable than owning a car. Also, many companies provide discounts or incentives to employees who take public transportation. This makes the cost come down even further. Saving money is important to people. Money that is spent on a car is money that is not available for other things. Using public transportation frees up more money to people for other needs. Once all of the factors have been considered, it’s evident that public transportation is the best choice because it saves money.

In addition, public transportation is a good idea because it’s safe. It’s well known that public transportation is safe for people who ride it, but a lesser known benefit is the safety it provides for the people living in those cities and towns. Communities with public transportation tend to build housing near that public transportation. An American Public Transit Association report from 2016 stated that “better public transportation contributes to more compact development.” This in turn “reduces auto-miles traveled and produces safer speeds in those areas” (Mackie, 2016). When people can travel fewer miles, and they go more slowly, there will be fewer accidents. This will be true even when people are not riding the public bus or train. It is clear that public transportation contributes to safety. It is the best choice for an individual, and also for communities overall.

One might say that public transportation isn’t very convenient. Since so many people in our communities have busy schedules and need to get places quickly, time is a priority. It might also be true that some areas do not have adequate transit options, and making connections would take up lots of time. Using one’s own car to travel seems like the best option. It is certainly true that travel time is an important factor when it comes to transportation choices. However, if more people use public transportation, it seems likely that the frequency of service will increase. New routes will appear over time, with closer connections. Once there are more buses and trains running, and more routes, public transportation will take less and less time. It may even take less time than driving. So, over time, choosing public transportation will quite possibly be the most convenient option.

Overall, even though many different types of transportation exist in our community, the choice that rises to the top is public transit. Individuals in our community will not only save money by taking advantage of public transportation, but as they travel from day to day they will also invest in creating safer and more well planned cities and towns. Public transit is an excellent choice. It is truly the wave of the future.

**  
Performance Task: Roundtable Presentations of Food Choices:** For the end of module culminating performance task, each student will create an infographic, or a visual image such as a chart or diagram used to represent information or data, that visually represents their claims, along with a 3-minute verbal presentation of the argument they made in their essay. Students will give their presentations in a roundtable style with an authentic audience of classmates, teachers, families, and community members. This infographic can then be shared on social media, through email, on a website, or on bulletins in a school or local supermarket to help others learn about making healthy food choices.

Criteria for the infographic:

- A clear recommendation for healthy and sustainable food choices

- Two reasons why your audience should consider your recommendation

- Two quotes or paraphrases from research texts that support each reason

- A counterclaim that addresses the opposition to your claim/recommendation

- Illustrations, images, or graphics that help convey your ideas

Criteria for the presentation:

- A 3-minute speech outlining the key points of your argument

- Domain-specific vocabulary to show your understanding of the topic

- An infographic to visually represent your ethical argument

- Appropriate eye contact, adequate volume, and clear pronunciation when presenting your claims

The reading and writing skills students develop in the fourteen lessons in Unit 3 prepare them for the mid-unit assessment, where they demonstrate their language skills by determining the meanings of unknown words and phrases, and for their end of unit assessment, where they write an argument essay on food choices.

Central to the EL Education curriculum is a focus on “habits of character” and social-emotional learning. With this in mind, students work on various habits of character throughout the curriculum:

- Work to Become Effective Learners—developing mindsets and skills for success in college, career, and life (e.g., initiative, responsibility, perseverance, collaboration)

- Work to Become Ethical People—treating others well and standing up for what is right (e.g., empathy, integrity, respect, compassion)

- Work to Contribute to a Better World—putting their learning to use to improve communities (e.g., citizenship, service)

In this unit, students focus on working to become effective learners. Students practice perseverance as they stick with it when learning new concepts and skills around argument writing, and collaborate to work successfully with a partner while crafting a practice argument essay.

How can you support your student at home?

Talk to your student about the guiding questions, particularly if any of the topics raised might be sensitive for your student or family.

Reach out to teachers if you have any questions or concerns about the text.

Look for real-world examples of argument writing, and discuss them with your student (debates, political speeches, etc.).

Discuss ways that you use argument writing skills (such as stating a claim and supporting it with reasons and evidence) in your daily life at home, in the community, and/or at work.

Help students prepare for their roundtable performance task by being a practice audience. Consider attending the roundtable discussion as an audience member.

Unit 3: Homework

Students continue to complete their independent research reading for homework and work on various argument writing tasks.

**Independent research reading:** When not reading his or her anchor text, your student is expected to independently research the topic. In the first lesson, students complete both types of reading as both independent research reading and the anchor text are introduced. When not assigned readings in the anchor text, students read topic-related books of their choice for approximately 20 minutes <u>each day</u> and respond to a prompt of choice in the <u>front</u> of the independent reading journal. These are usually books your student will bring home from school; however, they may be topic-related books chosen by your student at the public or your home library. Prompts for independent reading can be found in the homework materials provided.

**Choice reading:** If your student would also like to independently read and respond to a book of free choice, he or she may use the <u>back</u> of the independent reading journal. Prompts for independent reading can be found in the homework materials provided.

Independent Research Reading

**Directions:** Remember to record responses to research reading in the front of your independent reading journal and responses to choice reading in the back. Try to choose a different prompt each time.

Record any new vocabulary in your vocabulary log. Underline vocabulary found during independent reading.

**Record:**

- Date

- Title and author of your reading book

- Pages you have read

- Prompt

- Response

**Example:**

<u>Date:</u> 10/13/2020

<u>Book Title and Author:</u> *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* (Young Readers Edition) by Michael Pollan

<u>Pages Read:</u> 17–29

<u>Prompt:</u> What major ideas are present in the text you read? Give text details that convey those ideas.

<u>Response:</u> In this section, the author, Michael Pollan, talks about the prevalence of corn in the American diet. He shares examples of corn consumers knowingly ingest and highlights food products containing corn that are surprising to most Americans (e.g., wax on the vegetables we eat!). Details that he mentions on pages 18–19 are about how many items we eat that contain corn. In the example, he informs the reader that although we think of supermarkets as housing a large variety of items, most of those items contain corn. He goes on to say that corn is fed to the cattle, pigs, chicken, and fish we eat; to the chickens whose eggs we eat; and to the cows that produce dairy products we consume. This is just the beginning of the long list of items containing corn that Pollan shares with the reader. These details highlight how frequently Americans ingest corn—sometimes intentionally, and many times unknowingly. Pollan’s knowledge of these details and how he lays them out to the reader early in the book demonstrate his interest and purpose in writing the book—to inform consumers about the food they eat so they can make healthy food choices.

**Consider using the following independent reading prompts.**[^1]

- How does this text add to your understanding of one of the guiding questions of the module?

- Which habits of character are demonstrated in the text? Explain.

- What is the central idea or theme of the text? How was this idea developed?

- Record two or three facts in your own words that you learned from the text.

- Summarize your research reading today in no more than five sentences.

- What major ideas are present in the text you read? Give text details that convey those ideas.

- What questions do you have about the topic after reading?

- Choose one new word from your reading today, and analyze it on a vocabulary square.

|                                                   |                                            |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Definition in your own words**                  | **Synonyms** (words with the same meaning) |
| **Words with the same affix or root**             | **Sketch**                                 |
| **Translation in home language** (if appropriate) |                                            |

Vocabulary

**Directions:** In the classroom, you have been recording words from your texts in your vocabulary log. Throughout this unit, you have been research reading topic-related books at home to build your knowledge of where food comes from and recording words in your independent reading journal.

Choose a word from your research reading or from a text you’ve read in class, and add the word to your vocabulary log. Try to choose a different word to add and to practice a different vocabulary strategy each time. For each word, be sure to add the following:

1.  The definition, or meaning, of the word

<!-- -->

3.  The vocabulary strategy you used to figure out the meaning of the word

4.  A sketch or diagram that helps you to better understand the meaning of the word

Record new vocabulary in vocabulary logs, and mark academic vocabulary with a symbol—for example, a star:

- Academic vocabulary: Words you might find in informational texts on many different topics. For example, the words *evidence* and *rationale* are words that could be found in books on any topic.

- Domain-specific vocabulary: Words about a particular topic. For example, the words *tadpoles*, *frogspawn*, and *amphibian* are some that would be found on the topic of frogs.

**Vocabulary Strategies**

As a reminder, the vocabulary strategies we’ve been working on in class are:
