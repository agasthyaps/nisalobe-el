Teaching Notes for Unit 3

Prioritize Lessons for Classrooms with Many ELLs

The Mid-Unit 3 Assessment focuses on a variety of CCSS Language sub-standards (L.8.4b, L.8.4.c, L.8.5b, L.8.5c). The lessons leading up to this assessment (Lessons 1, 2) should be prioritized for ELLs, as they incorporate practice with language skills into entrance tickets and Work Times through a variety of tasks, including Language Dives. These language skills, including work with using context to determine the meanings of words and phrases and using the relationships among words to understand meaning, are valuable skills that ELLs will be able to apply not only during work in this unit, but down the road as they continue to read and write in a variety of genres.

Language Dives

In Lessons 1, 2, and 9, students participate in Language Dives. The first two Language Dives in this unit focus on sentences from text excerpts read in class and are intended to serve as preparation for work with vocabulary and relationships among words in sentences on the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment. The Language Dive in Lesson 9 provides students with an opportunity to carefully analyze a critical sentence in an essay: a statement that links a counterclaim to the writer’s response and rebuttal. A Language Dive empowers students to analyze, understand, and use the language of academic sentences, which often seems opaque to students. During a Language Dive, students slow down for 10–20 minutes to have a conversation about the meaning, purpose, and structure of a compelling sentence from a complex text, or from a learning target, checklist, or rubric included in the curriculum. Following the engaging deconstruct-reconstruct-practice routine of the Language Dive, students play with the smallest “chunks” of the sentence, interpreting them, rearranging them, or using them to talk about their own lives. As a result of paying close attention to how language works, all students begin to acquire the necessary facility with academic English, and ELLs foster their overall language ability. A consistent Language Dive routine is critical in helping all students learn how to decipher complex sentences and write their own.

Most Language Dives implicitly address a wide range of Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening, and Language standards. Once teachers are comfortable with Language Dives, they may choose to supplement the focus standards in a particular Language Dive with additional standards to meet their students’ needs. Note that the Rationale section of each Language Dive also identifies supporting standards that are explicitly addressed but are not the main focus of the Language Dive.

Note that the Language Dive Guides have been condensed in Module 2, as a way to reduce the amount of reading expected of teachers. Refer to the general best practices laid out in the Module 1 Language Dive Guides.

Mini Language Dives

Students have an opportunity to participate in Mini Language Dives beginning in Module 2, Unit 1. Mini Language Dives have the same overall purpose and follow the same general process as full Language Dives, but are condensed to 5 minutes, narrowing students’ attention on deconstructing the focus structure, reconstructing the sentence, and practicing the focus structure. Mini Language Dives give ELLs additional support in building language and literacy skills, as well as habits of mind. Mini Language Dives are most often optional and can be found in the corresponding lessons within this guide. When required for all students, Mini Language Dives are built into the body of the lesson in the Teacher Guide. Optional Mini Language Dives appear in Lessons 6 and 10.

Diversity and Inclusion

Investigate the routines, practices, rituals, beliefs, norms, and experiences that are important to ELLs and their families. Integrate this background into the classroom as students explore food choices. Create a supportive and inclusive classroom environment by reminding students that everyone is working toward improvement. Be sure to highlight and praise growth and development rather than relative performance. Use as a topic or text warmer or reflection with the entire class: a check-in at any strategic point during the unit to continually connect students’ personal experiences to the topic or text and to share how each one has changed and grown in association with the other. Invite students to share any cultural connections they may have made with the text. Foster inclusive action by creating space for students to express their feelings about the sensitive issues of environmental concerns and animal welfare embedded in the topic, knowing that these discussions may help create equity or unearth trauma, or both. Consult with a guidance counselor, school social worker, or ESL teacher for further investigation of diversity and inclusion.

Conversation Cues

Encourage productive and equitable conversation with Conversation Cues, which are questions that help students achieve four goals:

- (Goal 1) encourage all students to talk and be understood,

- (Goal 2) listen carefully to one another and seek to understand,

- (Goal 3) deepen thinking,

- and (Goal 4) think with others to expand the conversation (adapted from Michaels, Sarah and O’Connor, Cathy. *Talk Science Primer*. Cambridge, MA: TERC, 2012. http://inquiryproject.terc.edu/shared/pd/TalkScience_Primer.pdf. Based on Chapin, S., O’Connor, C., and Anderson, N. \[2009\]. *Classroom Discussions: Using Math Talk to Help Students Learn, Grades K–6*. Second Edition. Sausalito, CA: Math Solutions Publications).

Refer to the Tools Page (http://eled.org/tools) for the complete set of cues. Goal 1 Conversation Cues were introduced in Module 1, Unit 1; Goal 2 Conversation Cues were introduced in Module 1, Unit 3; and Goal 3 Conversation Cues were introduced in Module 2, Unit 2. All will continue to be used throughout this Module, and suggestions for integrating Conversation Cues into instruction are presented across lessons. For ELLs, Conversation Cues are especially critical because they improve language-processing abilities and increase engagement and participation.

Strategic Grouping

Students work in pairs and small groups during text-based discussions, Language Dives, and other tasks. For Language Dives and other tasks that focus on language, match ELLs with a partner who has greater language proficiency. For text-based discussions that focus on gist and central ideas, pair ELLs with students who share the same home language to allow for rich discussion around ideas. The conversations that happen as a result of such strategic pairing will greatly serve the language development of both partners. In this unit, students also work with partners to plan an argument essay. Pairs for this collaboration should be assigned with extra care, as students will work together across Lessons 5–10 with the same partners.

In-Class Reading

ELLs benefit from a gradual-release approach to in-class reading that increases their level of independence over time. For heavier support, ELLs may find it helpful to follow along during a read-aloud, and for lighter support, students can take turns reading aloud from the text and following along in small groups. Help students to understand that some of the language in texts may differ from classroom and home varieties of English.

Text-Based Discussions

As in Module 1 and Units 1 and 2 of this module, break down content, share-outs, or tasks into two parts for ELLs: cognitive and linguistic. First, invite home-language use to allow students to more comfortably process their ideas. This will allow students to first focus on the cognitive demands necessary to complete particularly demanding content, share-outs, or tasks. In addition, inviting home-language use helps students build academic mindsets. After they have met the cognitive demands in their home languages, they can be invited to discuss the task in classroom English, a language they are still learning. Some ELLs may require additional support during the performance task, as speaking in front of an audience in English may be particularly intimidating or anxiety-provoking for these students. Prioritize in-class discussions across the unit to help ELLs build confidence in their oral skills.

Differentiated Materials

Differentiated materials are available for ELLs and other students who would benefit from an increased level of support. These resources have been modified for the purposes of creating accessibility to content and concepts and supporting language development. Depending upon the task being carried out, images, selected response options, answer banks, sentence frames, or model responses have been embedded to guide students’ thinking without compromising a focus on standards and the skills that students are developing and applying to meet them.

Celebration

Celebrate the courage, enthusiasm, diversity, and bilingual assets that ELLs bring to the classroom. Additionally, students can celebrate their successful attempts at communication, focusing on progress rather than perfection.
