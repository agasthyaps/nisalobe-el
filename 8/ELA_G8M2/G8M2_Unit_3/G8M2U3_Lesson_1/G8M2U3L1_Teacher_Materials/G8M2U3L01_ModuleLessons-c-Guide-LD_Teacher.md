**Sentence**

Agribusinesses also need cheap corn **from which they make processed food and hundreds of other products.** (from page 40 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* by Michael Pollan)

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: To help students to address the daily learning target (**I can use context and the relationship among words to better understand the meanings of words and phrases in *The Omnivore’s Dilemma***) and L8.5., this sentence gives students the opportunity to consider how the words and information within a relative clause can be used to better understand the meaning of a phrase. Supporting Standards: RI.8.1, RI.8.2, RI.8.6, SL.8.6

- Guiding Question: To help students respond to the guiding question (**Where does our food come from?**), this sentence provides information about the agriculture industry.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses a relative clause with the purpose of describing how agribusinesses use corn. Invite students to discuss each chunk briefly, but encourage extended conversation and practice with the focus structure: **from which they make processed food and hundreds of other products.**

- Practice and Transfer: After discussing the focus structure, students practice using it to discuss something in their lives. Students transfer their understanding of the meaning and structure of this sentence in the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment when answering selected response questions about how the relationships among particular words can be used to better understand each of the words, and when writing an argument essay during the End of Unit 3 Assessment.

Throughout the Language Dive

Refer to the instructions provided in the first three Language Dives of Module 1.

To focus students’ attention on adjectives, nouns, and prepositions, use yellow, blue, and green markers to code the sentence (yellow: adjectives, blue: nouns, green: prepositions). One purpose of this Language Dive is to consider how the relationships among words help us to better understand the meanings of other words and phrases.

Deconstruct

- Invite students to put their finger by this sentence from *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* on their note-catchers: Agribusinesses also need cheap corn **from which they make processed food and hundreds of other products.**

- Read aloud the sentence twice, then ask students to take turns reading aloud the sentence with their partners.

- Ask:

“What does this sentence mean to you?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“How does this sentence add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

Agribusinesses also need

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following sentence chunk strip: **Agribusinesses also need**

- Ask:

“Can you use the affix agri- to figure out what agribusinesses are?” (Agri- means coming from the field or the land. So agribusinesses must be businesses that are associated with farming or growing things.)

“What do you think agribusinesses might need?” (Responses will vary, but may include: land, fertilizer, people to sell things to, and workers.)

cheap corn

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **cheap corn.**

- Underline cheap corn in yellow, and invite students to do the same on their note-catchers. 

- Ask:

“What comes to mind when you hear the adjective cheap? I’ll give you a moment to sketch on your note-catcher.” (Sketches will vary.) 

- Ask:

“How would the meaning of this chunk be different if the writer had used a word with a similar denotation but different connotation, like inexpensive, affordable, or low-cost, to describe corn?” (The word cheap suggests that something is low quality. It generally has a negative connotation. If the writer had used a word like inexpensive or affordable, the connotation would be more neutral.)

from which they make processed food and hundreds of other products.

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Underline which in blue, and invite students to do the same on their note-catchers. 

- Ask:

“Can you figure out which noun phrase the relative pronoun which is replacing? How do you know?” (Which is replacing the noun phrase that came before it in the sentence: cheap corn. The relative pronoun which always refers back to the last noun or noun phrase that came before it.)

- Underline from in green, and invite students to do the same on their note-catchers. 

- Ask:

“What does from tell us about cheap corn?” (that it is the source, origin, or beginning of something else)

- Cover **from which** with a piece of paper or your hand, and read aloud the remainder of the chunk: **they make processed food and hundreds of other products.**

- Ask:

“What do agribusinesses make processed food and hundreds of other products from?”  
(cheap corn)

- Ask:

“So how does this chunk help us to better understand the meaning of cheap corn?”  
(This chunk tells us that the corn is used to make many things, including food products.)

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Display the sentence frame:

**The students are reading *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

from + which + subject + predicate

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use the sentence frame to talk about what you are learning from reading The Omnivore’s Dilemma.”

Agribusinesses also need cheap corn from which they make processed food and hundreds of other products.

Reconstruct

- Point to and read aloud the entire sentence on display: **Agribusinesses also need cheap corn <u>from which they make processed food and hundreds of other products</u>**.

- Ask:

“Can we replace which with a different relative pronoun, such as where or that?”  
(No. The relative pronoun where is used to replace locations, and the relative pronoun that is not usually used after prepositions.)

- If productive, give an example to cue students to expand the conversation:

“What, in the sentence, makes you think so?” (Responses will vary.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- Ask:

“What other questions can we ask that will help us understand this sentence?”  
(Responses will vary.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does this Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

**Many foods are grown using GMOs \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**.

preposition + relative pronoun + subject + verb + object

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.
