Opportunities to Extend Learning

- If able, invite guest experts to discuss (or show videos of experts discussing) how the food industry produces and distributes food. The sections of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* that students will read in this lesson and the next lesson focus on the industrial food industry.

- Students can research nitrogen to better understand industrial food production and how it impacts the environment, and present their findings to the class. Encourage students to make connections to topics they are studying in science classes.

- In high school, students will apply knowledge of language to understand how language functions in different contexts, to make effective choices for meaning or style. Students might consider how the connotations of specific words impact how the reader interprets the writer’s point of view, tone, and motive.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students read sections from *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* and other sources to learn about food production and access to healthy food. Students continue to build their knowledge of these topics as they read a new section of the text in this lesson.

Support All Students

- Note that section 8 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* brings up the topic of agribusiness and suggests that agribusiness is turning farms into factory-style complexes rather than small, local, community-based farms. It also discusses how manure from livestock is used in farming. Some students or families may find these topics new, challenging, or upsetting based on their prior knowledge and experience, and some students may struggle to discuss animal waste in a classroom setting. Allow students time to process and respond to these topics during individual, small group, or full class discussion, and reach out to families as needed. Use thoughtful strategic pairing for discussions around these topics to ensure that all students feel comfortable.

- Students may struggle with scientific language in the text. Help students to track domain-specific words, and encourage them to consult reference resources as needed to determine or clarify the meanings of unknown words. Students may also find it helpful to conduct short internet searches to find information about scientific concepts mentioned in the text. ▲

- The complexity of the text may be especially difficult for ELLs. Encourage students to apply strategies for determining the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary and to think about the gist of each paragraph as they read. ▲

- Provide choice in how to carry out the reading portion of the lesson: some students may prefer to read independently and silently, while others (especially ELLs) may wish to read aloud in groups with peers and/or with support, while still others may wish to read silently for a few pages and then process with a group. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson supports students in analyzing language in *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*. A Language Dive in Work Time B gives students the opportunity to closely examine language structure and vocabulary. Practice within the lesson and homework both focus on CCSS Language standards (L.8.4, L.8.5). ELLs especially will benefit from the focused attention on connotation and on using context and relationships among words to better understand the meanings of words and sentences as they prepare for a language-based mid-unit assessment.

- ELLs may find it challenging to identify the connotations of particular words. Help students to consider context and tone in service to determining connotation. Allow significant processing time while reading, and have students reread the text multiple times, both aloud and independently. Encourage students to annotate unfamiliar vocabulary and language structures as they read the first time. Allow time to discuss students’ questions about new language, and then read the excerpt again.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6 and 8.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- Circulate to monitor students’ ability to use context, affixes, and the relationships among particular words to better understand each of the words and to explore how meaning is impacted by structure in *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will take the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment, which focuses on L.8.4a, L.8.4b, L.8.5b, and L.8.5c. Work in this lesson will prepare students to read a new excerpt from *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* and answer selected and constructed response questions on vocabulary and language structure on this assessment.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.8.4c (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **3**, **Lesson** **1**.

- Prompt students to Turn and Talk about their answers to the entrance ticket. Cold-call on students to share out.

- Focus students on the word *connotation* (an idea or feeling that a word invokes in addition to its literal or primary meaning). Invite students to use a **dictionary** to define the word.

- Explain to students that words often have similar literal meanings, but their connotations are sometimes different. As needed, remind students that literal meaning is the basic or straightforward meaning of a word. We also can call the literal meaning a word’s *denotation*. A word’s *connotation* is the emotional or secondary meaning it has. For example, the words *interested* and *nosy* both can be used to describe someone who is seeking information, but one of them, *nosy*, has a negative, or critical connotation; *interested*, on the other hand, has a more neutral or even positive connotation.

- Prompt students to add the words *connotation* (an idea or feeling that a word invokes in addition to its literal or primary meaning) and *denotation* (the literal or basic meaning of a word) and their definitions to their **vocabulary** **logs**. With students’ support, record the meanings to the **academic** **word** **wall**. Write synonyms or sketch a visual above the words to scaffold students’ understanding. Add any relevant notes to the vocabulary strategies on the **Close** **Readers** **Do** **These** **Things** **anchor** **chart** on the academic word wall.

- Turn and Talk:

“What other words can you think of that have similar meanings (denotations) but different connotations?” (Responses will vary. Provide examples like the following: *mother/mommy, old/vintage, confident/arrogant, inexpensive/cheap*.)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 8, and Analyze Word Connotations – L.8.5c (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can recognize the differences among connotations of words with similar meanings in *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*.”

- Remind students that throughout the module so far, they have been reading about topics that influence access to healthy food. Tell students that in the first two lessons of this unit, they are going to continue to read *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* to learn more about how food is produced while also examining language. Explain to students that this information will be useful to them later in the unit when they will write about healthy and sustainable food choices. Tell students they will now consider the connotations of words within *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same process as with previous lessons for students to read section 8 of ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma***, using the **Text** **Guide**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma*** (**for** **teacher** **reference**). Instruct students to read the section independently, and support struggling students as needed. As time permits, have students identify the meanings of unfamiliar vocabulary, reflect on their reading as they choose, and record the gist using the following resources as appropriate: **sticky** **notes** and vocabulary logs.

- Instruct students to turn to page 41, and invite a volunteer to read aloud the following, at the bottom of the page:

“And so the government helped launch the chemical fertilizer industry. (It also helped start the pesticide industry, since insect killers are based on poison gases developed for the war.)”

- Focus students’ attention on the words *launch* and *start*. Explain that these words have similar denotative meanings because they are both verbs that mean to begin, but their connotations are quite different.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What does the word *launch* make you think of?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all replies, and help students to understand that *launch* means to set something in motion.)

“What do you think of when you hear the word *start*?” (Responses will vary, but may include synonyms like *begin*, *create*, and *introduce*.)

“How is the connotation of *launch* different from the connotation of *start*?” (*Launch* connotes strong action, motion, and forward momentum, while *start* connotes a simple, straightforward beginning.)

“What other synonyms for *launch* and *start* can you think of that have similar denotative meanings but different connotations?” (Responses will vary. If necessary, provide examples like *begin, get going, introduce, create, embark*.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Work Time

B. Language Dive: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Page 40 – L.8.5b (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can use context and the relationships among words to better understand the meanings of words and phrases in *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*.”

- Tell students they will now participate in a Language Dive to explore how context and the relationships among words can be used to better understand the meaning of a sentence in *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*.

- Reread aloud page 40 of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*.

- Focus students’ attention on the sentence:

- “Agribusinesses also need cheap corn from which they make processed food and hundreds of other products.”

- Use the **Language** **Dive** **Guide**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma,*** **Page** **40** (**for** **teacher** **reference**) to guide students through a Language Dive conversation about the sentence. Distribute and display the **Language** **Dive**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma,*** **Page** **40** **note** - **catcher**, and the **Language** **Dive**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma,*** **Page** **40** **sentence** **chunk** **strips**. Refer to the **Language** **Dive**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma,*** **Page** **40** **note** - **catcher** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- With students’ support, record the meaning of the word *agribusiness* (a business in the agricultural industry) on the **domain** - **specific** **word** **wall**, with translations in students’ home languages. Write synonyms or sketch a visual above the term to scaffold students’ understanding. Invite students to record this word in their vocabulary logs.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time B, for additional practice with relative clauses after the Language Dive, invite students to write a summary of the text excerpt that includes at least two sentences with relative clauses. Students can share these examples in small groups or with the whole class.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time B, for additional practice with relative clauses after the Language Dive, invite students to find examples in the text. Display a list of relative pronouns (*who*, *which*, *that*, *where*, *when*) to help guide the process. Students can share examples in small groups or with the whole class.

Work Time

C. Analyze Language: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 8 – L.8.5b (10 minutes)

- Review the learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can use context and the relationships among words to better understand the meanings of words and phrases in *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*.”

“I can recognize the differences among connotations of words with similar meanings in *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*.”

- Tell students that, as they have just seen, the words authors choose are very intentional. Explain that they will now use what they know about working with words to better understand the text.

- Group students strategically into pairs.

- Display and distribute the **Analyze** **Language**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma***, **Section** **8** handout. Read each of the questions aloud as students read along silently, and explain that students will work together to answer the questions about language in the text excerpt. Answer any clarifying questions.

- Display the **affix** **list**, and instruct students to retrieve their copies. Focus students’ attention on the prefix *eco* -. Read aloud the meaning and examples. Instruct students to refer to this section of the affix list to answer question 4.

- Instruct students to answer the selected response questions in pairs.

- Circulate as students work to ensure they are on track, and answer any clarifying questions. Identify any common misconceptions about connotations and denotations to address in future lessons. As needed, refer to **Analyze** **Language**: ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma***, **Section** **8** (**answers** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

Closing and Assessment

A. Pair-Share – L.8.5b (5 minutes)

- Refocus students’ attention on the Analyze Language: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma*, Section 8 handout.

- Invite volunteers to share their responses to each question. As students respond, use Conversation Cues to prompt them to provide appropriate reasoning and evidence:

“Why do you think that?”

“What, in the (sentence/text), makes you think so?”

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Homework

A. Analyze Language

- Students answer selected response questions about language to complete **Homework: Analyze Language: *The Omnivore’s Dilemma***, **Section 8**.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent** **reading** **journal**.
