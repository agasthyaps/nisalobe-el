**Transportation Choices**

W.8.1a Topic clearly and concisely introduced with background information. Previews complicated considerations involved in making decisions about modes of transportation before stating claim.

W.8.1a Introduces clearly stated claim and organizes points with a main claim statement about transportation choices.

W.8.1b Claim shows an understanding of the topic, is supported by reasons and evidence from accurate credible sources, and shows a solid understanding of the transportation choices.

**Prompt:** What is the best mode of transportation for members of our community?

Transportation, and how we move around in our community, is an essential aspect of everyday life. We need to get to places easily, safely, and efficiently, and like most modern Americans, we are constantly on the go! When it comes to the best way we can get from one place to another, people have a lot of choices to make. We can ride bikes, take buses or other public transportation, drive cars, participate in car sharing or a carpool, or even walk. Regardless of which modes of transportation one chooses, each has its own pros and cons that should be considered before determining the choice that is best for individuals and their community. Once these considerations have been taken into account, it will be clear the best transportation choice that members of our community can make is to use public transit.

Public transportation makes sense <u>because</u> it is less expensive than other forms of travel. Cars, in particular, are very expensive to own and operate. A 2013 article in USA Today states that “on average, the cost of driving 15,000 miles a year rose 1.17 cents to 60.8 cents per mile, or \$9,122 per year” (Copeland, 2013). Driving a car is expensive in many ways. The driver has to pay for gas, insurance, and maintenance, all on top of the car payment itself. That’s a huge expense. Taking the bus every day costs significantly less than that. So does travelling by train or light rail. A monthly transit pass in Denver, for example, is just \$99, or \$1,200 per year for an individual (RTD Denver). Even for a family of five, that would be significantly more affordable than owning a car. Also, many companies provide discounts or incentives to employees who take public transportation. This makes the cost come down even further. Saving money is important to people. Money that is spent on a car is money that is not available for other things. Using public transportation frees up more money to people for other needs. Once all of the factors have been considered, it’s evident that public transportation is the best choice because it saves money.

In addition, public transportation is a good idea because it’s safe. It’s well known that public transportation is safe for people who ride it, but a lesser known benefit is the safety it provides for the people living in those cities and towns. Communities with public transportation tend to build housing near that public transportation. An American Public Transit Association report from 2016 stated that “better public transportation contributes to more compact development.” This in turn “reduces auto-miles traveled and produces safer speeds in those areas” (Mackie, 2016). When people can travel fewer miles, and they go more slowly, there will be fewer accidents. This will be true even when people are not riding the public bus or train. It is clear that public transportation contributes to safety. It is the best choice for an individual and also for communities overall.

W.8.1b Supports point with relevant evidence such as quotes from the text and reasoning that explains the evidence.

W.8.1c Uses phrases like “This in  
turn . . .” to clarify the relationship between ideas.

W.8.1d Establishes and maintains a formal style with formal vocabulary instead of colloquial vocabulary.

W.8.1c Uses transitions to move from one idea to the next. Evidence and elaboration show how the claim and counterclaim reasons and evidence are related.

W.8.1a Acknowledges evidence that counters claim, and explains its validity, while further elaborating on the benefits and relevance of claim.

W.8.1e Conclusion restates argument and includes thinking about the importance of public transportation choices and the benefits of this choice.

One might say that public transportation isn’t very convenient. Since so many people in our communities have busy schedules and need to get places quickly, time is a priority. It might also be true that some areas do not have adequate transit options, and making connections would take up lots of time. Using one’s own car to travel seems like the best option. It is certainly true that travel time is an important factor when it comes to transportation choices. However, if more people use public transportation, it seems likely that the frequency of service will increase. New routes will appear over time, with closer connections. Once there are more buses and trains running, and more routes, public transportation will take less and less time. It may even take less time than driving. So, over time, choosing public transportation will quite possibly be the most convenient option.

Overall, even though many different types of transportation exist in our community, the choice that rises to the top is public transit. Individuals in our community will not only save money by taking advantage of public transportation, but as they travel from day to day they will also invest in creating safer and more well-planned cities and towns. Public transit is an excellent choice. It is truly the wave of the future.
