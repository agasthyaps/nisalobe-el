Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- SL.8.4 – Opening A: On their entrance ticket, students begin to think about the key points they might include in their oral presentations.

- SL.8.4 – Work Time A: Students analyze model prompt cards to prepare for their presentations, considering how to present their claims and findings and emphasize key points.

- SL.8.6 – Work Time A: Students analyze model prompt cards adapted from an argument essay and consider how to adapt their speech to the context of a presentation.

- SL.8.4 – Work Time B: Students identify the key points in their argument essays to use in a presentation, and they create prompt cards to support this.

- SL.8.6 – Work Time B: Students adapt key points from their argument essays to use in their speech during their presentations.

- SL.8.4 – Closing and Assessment A: Students practice their roundtable presentations, using appropriate eye contact, adequate volume, and clear pronunciation when presenting their claims and findings.

- W.8.5 – Closing and Assessment A: Students provide feedback to classmates on their presentations using the criteria listed on the Performance Task Criteria anchor chart, and they revise and refine the prompt cards accordingly.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Provide students with specific presentation skills to focus on during their presentation practice in Closing and Assessment A—for example, saying each word clearly and carefully or using domain-specific vocabulary.

- If time permits, provide additional in-class time for students to work on their presentations and to peer-review one another’s presentations to ensure quality and consistency.

- Students can prepare an additional infographic on a topic of their choice and prepare a short presentation to deliver to friends and family. Encourage students to choose a topic or argument in which they feel personally invested.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students created infographics as visual representations of the argument in their essay. In this lesson, students create the prompt cards for their spoken presentations for roundtables in the performance task in the next lesson.

Support All Students

- Providing written and verbal directions, and charting the steps they will take to create their prompt cards and present to a peer, can help students understand what to do. ▲

- To build in additional practice with organizing information on prompt cards, before students prepare prompt cards for their individual presentations, have them work in groups to prepare prompt cards for an infographic on a different topic. For extended support, students can work in groups to prepare infographics for the practice essays they wrote and then prepare prompt cards for this topic. ▲

- Students may benefit from watching videos of presentations, especially student presentations and/or roundtables in a classroom setting. Show students examples of presentations to help them understand the criteria. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson includes further performance task analysis; preparation time; collaborative, supportive peer sharing and review; and an opportunity to rehearse presentations orally. Students work collaboratively to prepare their presentations and receive feedback from peers in Closing and Assessment A. In Work Time B, students have the opportunity to rehearse their performance task presentations. This will help students to feel empowered as they get ready to deliver their presentations in a roundtable format in Lesson 15.

- ELLs may find it challenging to rehearse their presentations in front of their classmates, as delivering presentations is often anxiety-provoking, especially for ELLs. Help students gain confidence by offering specific examples of effective oral skills, and encourage students to do the same for one another. Model providing suggestions for improvement that are kind, specific, and helpful.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.C.9 and 8.I.C.10.

Assessment Guidance

- Review student work during and after the lesson either to provide specific feedback/suggestions or to identify common issues that could be used as whole group teaching points in future lessons. Ensure that students are meeting the criteria for the prompt cards.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will participate in the roundtable presentations.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare:

- Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 14

- Student will need copies of their argument essays from Lessons 11–12, completed for the End of Unit 3 Assessment, to complete their entrance tickets, and they may also need them to be able to work on their presentations.

- Performance Task: Model Prompt Cards to present to students as a model of how they will present in their roundtables. Please note it is important that this sounds like a presentation rather than reading from a script, as this is what students will be required to do in the roundtable presentations in Lesson 15.

- Copies of the model visual to present with—Performance Task: Model Infographic.

- Consider how to engage and sustain effort and persistence throughout the lesson, as students will not be formally assessed on their performance task. Remind students of the many “real-world” applications of effective presentation skills and technical literacy. Focus students on the joy of learning for learning’s sake.

- Ensure there is a copy of Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 14 at each student’s workspace.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time B: Prepare a device with a projector to project the model performance task and model prompt cards.

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous modules to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – SL.8.4 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **3**, **Lesson** **14**. Students will need their **argument** **essays** to complete their entrance tickets.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons. Focus students specifically on *key* *points*, and ensure they understand that *key* *points* are the most important points a speaker is trying to make.

Work Time

A. Analyze Model Prompt Cards – SL.8.4 (10 minutes)

- Remind students that in the previous lesson, they created their infographic for their performance task, which is a visual representation of their argument. Students will create prompt cards to help them present the information in their infographic during their roundtable presentations.

- Display the **Model** **Essay**: “ **Transportation** **Choices**,” and ask students to retrieve their copies. Review the author’s claim, points, reasoning, and evidence. Use **Model** **Essay**: “ **Transportation** **Choices** ” (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as needed.

- Display the **Performance** **Task**: **Model** **Prompt** **Cards**, and distribute copies to students. Read aloud each prompt card. Invite students to focus their attention specifically on the words being spoken.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What are the key parts the presenter has used from the essay in his or her presentation?” (Responses will vary, but may include: the claim, reasons, evidence, and counterclaim.)

“How is the presentation different from the essay?” (Students should recognize that the content of the transcript comes directly from the essay but is revised or shortened to focus on key points and evidence, and refers to how students will use visual elements, an aspect not present in the essay.)

- Select students to share out whole group, and record their responses on the **Performance** **Task** **Criteria** **anchor** **chart**, under the subheading “Prompt Cards.” See **Performance** **Task** **Criteria** **anchor** **chart** (**for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Turn and Talk:

“Why didn’t I just read the argument essay aloud, like a script? Why did I use prompt cards?” (Reading the argument essay aloud like a script would prevent the presenter from doing things like making eye contact with the audience, adjusting the presentation based on the audience’s reactions—for example, adding more explanation if the audience looks confused—and effectively using the visuals.)

- Emphasize the importance of presenters being able to engage with their audience. If necessary, show students videos of people presenting to audiences.

Work Time

B. Identify Key Points for a Presentation – SL.8.4 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify key points from my essay to create prompt cards for my 3-minute presentation.”

- Invite students to retrieve their entrance tickets from the beginning of the lesson and to work with an elbow partner to share the key points they had identified. Encourage students to revise their key points with the support of their partner based on what they heard in the model presentation. After 5 minutes of work time, refocus the whole group, and cold-call on students to share the key points they would like to present. Use the Performance Task: Model Prompt Cards to clarify any misconceptions.

- Turn and Talk:

“What type of tone and vocabulary should you use for a formal presentation?” (a professional tone and academic vocabulary)

- Distribute **index** **cards**.

- Invite students to use the Performance Task: Model Prompt Cards and their **infographics** to create prompt cards for their own presentations.

- Circulate as students work, and ensure they are using relevant information from their essay and their prompt cards.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Closing and Assessment

A. Presentation Practice and Peer Feedback – SL.8.4 (15 minutes)

- Refocus whole group.

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can use appropriate eye contact, adequate volume, and clear pronunciation when presenting my claims and findings.”

“I can revise and strengthen my prompt cards using peer feedback.”

- Tell students that they will now have an opportunity to use their prompt cards to practice their presentations at a roundtable. Explain that this process will help them identify additional information they might need to add to their prompt cards in order to support them in presenting effectively.

- Focus students on the Performance Task Criteria anchor chart, and ask them to Think-Pair-Share:

“Think about the presentation skills you developed in this module. What are some key speaking and listening skills needed for an effective presentation?” (Responses will vary, but may include: speaking slowly and clearly, articulating each word carefully, making eye contact with the audience.)

- Select students to share out to the whole group, and record their responses on the Performance Task Criteria anchor chart, under the subheading “Presentation.” See Performance Task Criteria anchor chart (for teacher reference).

- Organize students and tables/desks and chairs into triads.

- Guide students through the following process using a whole group **timer** to move them onto the next step in unison:

- A presents for 3 minutes.

- B and C provide feedback and A makes revisions for 1 minute.

- B presents for 3 minutes.

- A and C provide feedback and B makes revisions for 1 minute.

- C presents for 3 minutes.

- A and B provide feedback and C makes revisions for 1 minute.

- Circulate to support students as they revise their work. Remind them that they may thoughtfully reject some suggestions from their peers if they have other ideas on how to meet the criteria and consider how best to implement other suggestions.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- During the peer feedback exchange, invite students to generate two stars and two steps for their partners. To maximize feedback, have students work in small groups of three or four rather than pairs, to provide an opportunity for students to receive feedback from more than one person. This will also give students the opportunity to see multiple examples of writing, which will help to inform students’ own presentation points and visuals, as well.

For Heavier Support

- In advance of Closing and Assessment A, provide students with a list of five to ten common errors that have been noted in previous student speaking and examples of corrections to help guide their presentations. This list might include items from categories like grammar (e.g., verb tenses, subject-verb agreement, sentence structure), volume and pacing (e.g., speak loudly and pause to ensure understanding), or word choice (e.g., formal vs. informal varieties of English).

Homework

A. Practice Presentations

- Students practice using prompt cards to prepare for their presentations.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent** **reading** **journal**.
