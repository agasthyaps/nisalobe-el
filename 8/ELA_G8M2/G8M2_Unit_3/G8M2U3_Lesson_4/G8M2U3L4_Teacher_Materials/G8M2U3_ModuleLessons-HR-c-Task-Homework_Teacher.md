Homework: Argument Essay Structure

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Read the introductory paragraphs from the Model Essay: “Transportation Choices,” and then answer the questions below:

<u>“Transportation, and how we move around in our community, is an essential aspect of everyday life. We need to get to places easily, safely, and efficiently, and like most modern Americans, we are constantly on the go! When it comes to the best way we can get from one place to another, people have a lot of choices to make. We can ride bikes, take buses or other public transportation, drive cars, participate in car sharing or a carpool, or even walk. Regardless of which modes of transportation one chooses, each has its own pros and cons that should be considered before determining the choice that is best for individuals and their community.</u> Once these considerations have been taken into account, it will be clear the best transportation choice that members of our community can make is to use public transit.
