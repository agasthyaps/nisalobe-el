Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.8.1 – Opening A: Students recall the process of analyzing previous model essays to consider how doing so can help them as they prepare to write an argument essay.

- W.8.1 – Work Time B: Students use the Painted Essay® structure to analyze a model argument essay, looking closely at how the writer created an argument to support a claim with clear reasons and relevant evidence.

- W.8.4 – Work Time C: Students analyze the organization and development of a model argument essay, reflecting on how each paragraph relates to the author’s purpose.

- RI.8.1 – Work Time C: Students analyze the model argument essay and make connections to the criteria for effective argument essays.

- W.8.1 – Work Time C: Students analyze the model argument essay and make connections to the criteria for effective argument essays.

- W.8.1 – Closing and Assessment A: As they examine the Characteristics of Argument Writing anchor chart, students identify aspects of the model essay that align to argument writing. They note where the writer created an argument to support a claim with clear reasons and relevant evidence.

- In this lesson, students analyze a model essay using the Painted Essay® structure to generate criteria for their own essays (W.8.1, W.8.4).

- The Painted Essay® (Diana Leddy, Vermont Writing Collaborative) guides students to code each section of their essay a different color to understand each part, the content of each part, and how the different parts connect.

- The Argument Writing checklist used in Work Time C is a consistent resource in all grades; consider the amount of detail needed in modeling this for students.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become ethical people, showing integrity and respect as they discuss considerations around transportation choices. Students also focus on working to become effective learners, persevering as they read and analyze a new text with partners.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Students may start to outline their essay on healthy and sustainable food choices in preparation for the coming lessons.

- Students may examine more samples of argument essays. Providing multiple sample essays for students to color-code and analyze will support their understanding of genre and the subtleties of writing a counterclaim and using reasoning effectively.

- Students can generate additional points that support the argument in Model Essay: “Transportation Choices” and provide new evidence and reasoning.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Students have worked with the Painted Essay® structure previously in this module. In this unit, they use the same structure but analyze how it changes slightly for argument writing.

- The model students analyze is about choices people have when it comes to transportation. Although the essay is not written about healthy food, examining this essay prepares students to write an argument essay similar in structure and type of thinking to the model. The student essay will be about food choices that are optimal for health and the environment. This assignment builds on the examination of research students did in Unit 2 and the reading of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* in Unit 1. Students use evidence from this anchor text, their own research case study, and other sources, if they choose, to support the claim they make in their argument essay.

Support All Students

- For students who may be overwhelmed by too much print on a page, reduce anxiety and support sustained effort by offering a copy of the model essay with one paragraph per page. ▲

- For students who may require additional support when reading for gist, pair students heterogeneously for this activity, or group and read aloud to students who may need additional reading support. ▲

- Incorporate a mix of processing opportunities after reading, including writing reflections and small group and whole-class discussion. ▲

- The content of transportation options (in the model essay) could be unfamiliar to students, depending on life experience and previous areas of study. Some students might have trouble transferring the argument about transportation to their current work with food choices. Rely on the Argument Writing checklist as a way of drawing connections between content and highlighting important structures of the argument essay they will replicate in their own writing. ▲

- Vocabulary in the model and checklist could challenge students, especially ELLs. Provide strategic partnerships to support reading comprehension and vocabulary understanding while dissecting the model. ▲

- Provide opportunities for students to talk about the model essay and process their understanding of it verbally, particularly of the reasoning and counterclaim. ▲

- Students might have difficulty seeing the nuanced differences between an argument essay and an informative essay. Creating anchor charts that capture important differences between informative essays and argument essays for student reference could continue to support students through the planning and drafting process. ▲

- The model essay can be delivered electronically to students.

- To support ELLs, this lesson introduces a new model essay and invites students to use the Painted Essay® to analyze its structure. Work with the Painted Essay® will help students understand the content and structure of the model essay, which students will apply when writing their own argument essays. Students work together to identify the characteristics of an argument essay using a checklist, as they have done with previous genres of writing. This consistent pattern of reading a model essay for gist, coding elements of the essay using the Painted Essay®, and using a checklist to analyze the characteristics of the essay sets students up for success in navigating the nuanced differences between different types of essays and allows them to focus on key differences by minimizing distractions that might come from acclimating to a new process.

- ELLs may find it challenging to identify the characteristics of an argument essay and of argumentation, in general. Draw students’ attention to how language is used within the model to present claims and provide reasoning. Encourage students to annotate the model essay as they identify criteria from the Argument Writing checklist. If time allows, refer back to previous essays that students have written, and invite students to compare and contrast the similarities and differences between different types of essays.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.II.A.1 and 8.II.A.2.

Assessment Guidance

- During Work Time A, check students’ understanding of gist in the model essay. Use any misconceptions or common issues as teaching points in upcoming lessons when the model is deconstructed in a more detailed way.

- Throughout Work Time B, frequently review students’ work to ensure they are color-coding accurately. Use common issues as whole group teaching points.

Down the Road

- In Lessons 5–10, students continue to deconstruct the model and complete a practice argument essay. In each of those lessons, students look at a discrete aspect of the argument essay model and practice using it in their own writing. Students then plan and draft an argument essay during their end of unit assessment in Lessons 11–12.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.8.1 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **3**, **Lesson** **4**.

- Once all students are ready, invite them to use their answers on Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 4 to engage in a Think-Pair-Share of the following question:

“How is it useful to analyze a model essay as part of the writing process? How did looking at this model essay help you as a writer?” (Responses will vary, but may include: Analyzing a model supports us as students as we deepen our vision for certain genres of writing and develop and apply new writing skills. Each model essay was used to examine the structure for the particular genre of writing, and each was used as a tool to understand what successful writing looks like.)

- Using a total participation technique, invite responses from the group.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Find the Gist of a Model Argument Essay (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can find the gist of a model essay.”

- Distribute and display the **Model** **Essay**: “ **Transportation** **Choices**.” Explain that this model essay will help them understand a new genre of writing—argument essays.

- Read the essay aloud as students follow along, reading silently.

- Ask:

“What is this gist of this model essay?” (It describes the issues people should take into account when making choices around public transportation. It explains how public transportation is cost-effective and helps to create safer cities and towns for pedestrians. It gives reasons and evidence to support this claim.)

- Instruct students to reread the Model Essay: “Transportation Choices” aloud with their partner, pausing after each paragraph to share the gist with one another and check for understanding.

- After students have finished reading, use a total participation technique and invite responses from the group.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What is the gist of paragraph 1?” (There are many transportation options, but public transportation is the best choice.)

“What is the gist of paragraph 2?” (Public transportation is the most cost-effective transportation choice.)

“What is the gist of paragraph 3?” (Public transportation is safe. It helps promote infrastructure for pedestrians and helps local communities.)

“What is the gist of paragraph 4?” (Some people think public transportation is not efficient, but if used more, efficiency increases.)

“What is the gist of paragraph 5?” (Public transportation is good for everyone.)

- Record responses on the displayed model, and instruct students to follow along, recording responses on their own handouts.

- Remind students that when discussing the Model Essay: “GMOs” in Unit 2, they looked at the tone of the essay. Similarly, it is important to analyze the tone in this new model essay. Explain that while discussing the choices people make around transportation, the writer is careful to avoid blanket statements and overreach. This makes the essay more accurate and readable and also projects a respectful tone. One effective strategy the writer uses for this is including words like *seems*, *may*, *can*, and *it’s* *possible*. Direct students back to the Model Essay: “Transportation Choices,” and have them underline any words that suggest a respectful tone. Use the **Model** **Essay**: “ **Transportation** **Choices** ” (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as needed, and call on students to share out the terms they underline.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- For continued spiraling with supplemental work with L.8.1a and verbals, invite students to underline all infinitives and circle gerunds throughout the essay. If time allows, display a list of possible functions (e.g., noun phrase/activity, adjective phrase, adverb phrase, to indicate intention, to add a definition, to add a description), and invite students to call out examples for each category. This task will reinforce work that students have done with infinities and gerunds in Language Dives and Mini Language Dives in this module, and build toward further work with this language in Mini Language Dives in Lessons 6 and 9 of this Unit, equipping students to effectively use verbals in their own writing as they complete the partner argument essay and the End of Unit 3 Assessment argument essay.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time A, provide a version of the Model Essay: “Transportation Choices” that includes larger text and wider spacing cut into strips by paragraph. Invite students to work together in groups to reorder scrambled sentences and paste them on chart paper to create a collaborative, tactile experience. Once students have assembled the strips, they can determine gist and color-code them according to the Painted Essay®.

Work Time

B. Analyze a Model Argument Essay – W.8.1 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify the parts of a model argument essay and explain the purpose of each.”

- Display a **Painted** **Essay** ® **template**, and direct students to gather this resource from Module 1. Have students Turn and Talk to a predesignated partner whom they will consult for the remainder of the lesson:

“Describe how this template is organized, and explain the name and purpose of each part of the template.” (Responses will vary, but students may share the purpose of each section, naming the colors and their correspondence to each part of the essay.)

- Display the Model Essay: “Transportation Choices” again. Distribute **colored** **pencils**, and guide students in using these and their Painted Essay® template with their partners to color-code their Model Essay: “Transportation Choices.” Refer to the **Paint** **an** **Essay** **lesson** **plan** (**for** **teacher** **reference**) for further detail.

- Read the first paragraph aloud as students follow along, pausing to color-code each part of the essay.

- Turn and Talk:

“How should I color-code the first paragraph?” (Most of the first paragraph is introducing the topic and should be red. This information provides the context the reader needs to know about various transportation options people have. The main claim is color-coded green. The claim provides the main idea that you want the reader to take away.)

- Clarify the language students will use to name the parts of an argument essay. Explain that in an argument essay, the focus statement is referred to as the *main* *claim* and is color-coded <u>green</u>. Explain that in an argument, we usually state just the “green” part of the focus in the introduction to the piece. This makes the main claim very clear and strong. The essay still makes points to support the main claim, but they are not stated in the introduction. Rather, the points will unfold as the argument develops.

- With students’ support, record the meaning of *main* *claim* (focus statement) on the **academic** **word** **wall**, with translations in students’ home languages. Write synonyms or sketch a visual above the key term to scaffold students’ understanding. Invite students to record this word in their **vocabulary** **logs**.

- Ask:

“The next two Proof Paragraphs will develop the main claim with relevant points. In this essay, these points are reasons that support this claim. How should we color-code each reason that supports the claim?” (The first point should be color-coded in yellow and the second in blue.)

- Ensure students understand that the main claim states one main consideration. Two reasons, which are given and explained in each Proof Paragraph, support this main claim. For example, in the model, the two reasons the author gives to support public transportation as the best choice are its low cost and safety for the community. These are the basis of each Proof Paragraph. Each reason includes the word *because* in it. Instruct students to underline where they see the word *because* used in the reasons stated in the model essay.

- Focus students on the fourth paragraph of the model essay, the counterclaim. Explain that this is a new kind of Proof Paragraph, one they did not see in informative writing. Remind students that an argument is usually written about a complicated idea, one about which reasonable people can have different opinions. Explain that when constructing an argument, it is important to address possible opposition to their main claim. This is often called a *counterclaim*. There are several approaches to creating and using a counterclaim. In this essay, the author presents an alternate, valid claim, an opinion different from his or her own. He/she acknowledges it but then uses it to support his/her own original claim. Explain that students will look more closely at how to construct a counterclaim in later lessons.

- With students’ support, record the meaning of *counterclaim* (a claim made to rebut a previous claim) on the academic word wall, with translations in students’ home languages. Write synonyms or sketch a visual above the key term to scaffold students’ understanding. Invite students to record this word in their vocabulary logs.

- Instruct students to color-code the counterclaim paragraph <u>yellow</u> because a counterclaim is just a special kind of Proof Paragraph. This counterclaim is giving another reason why public transportation is a good choice, like the yellow Proof Paragraph.

- Instruct student pairs to reread and discuss each part of the model, color-coding the rest of the essay as they proceed.

- As students are working, check to see if they are color-coding their Proof Paragraphs correctly. Pause, as needed, to clarify any misconceptions and to redirect engagement.

- Refocus the whole class.

- Draw students’ attention to the conclusion paragraph.

- Ask:

“What is the role of the conclusion in an argument essay?” (Responses will vary, but may include: to wrap up the piece by restating the claim and adding some additional thinking about why it is important.)

“How did you color-code the conclusion paragraph?” (The first part of this paragraph in green, yellow, and blue because it is a mix of the claim, reason 1, and reason 2. Students might also mention that the shade of green differs from that used in the main claim in the introduction.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Work Time

C. Argument Writing Checklist – W.8.1 (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can generate criteria for an effective argument essay.”

- Distribute and display the **Argument** **Writing** **checklist**. Prompt students to read the criteria on the checklist.

- Using a total participation technique, invite responses from the group:

“What do you notice about this checklist? What do you wonder?” (Responses will vary.)

- Give students a few minutes to reread the Model Essay: “Transportation Choices.” Then, use a total participation technique to invite responses from the group:

“What characteristics on this checklist do you see done well in the model? What evidence from the model supports your thinking?” (Responses will vary, but may include: the author successfully gives two points to support the claim, evidence is used and explained, and there is a counterclaim.)

- If productive, cue students to listen carefully and seek to understand, and then to explain why a classmate came up with a particular response:

“Who can tell us what your classmate said, in your own words?” (Responses will vary.)

“Who can explain why your classmate came up with that response?” (Responses will vary.)

- Prompt students to revisit their Model Essay: “Transportation Choices” and jot down an additional description for each aspect on the Argument Writing checklist.

- Invite any additional responses from the group. As students share out the characteristics, jot down, say aloud, sketch, and display each characteristic to provide visual reinforcement. Invite students to identify characteristics of argument writing used in the model essay which can be applied to their own writing. Refer to the **Argument** **Writing** **checklist** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) as needed.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Closing and Assessment

A. Debrief Argument Writing Anchor Chart – W.8.1 (5 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can generate criteria for an effective argument essay.”

- Invite students to think about the model and name some of the characteristics of argument writing they have noticed. Explain that they will continue to add to this chart in future lessons as they analyze each paragraph in the model. Refer to the **Characteristics** **of** **Argument** **Writing** **anchor** **chart** (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**) for support.

- Record student responses on the **Characteristics** **of** **Argument** **Writing** **anchor** **chart**, answering questions and clarifying any misconceptions.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework
