Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- SL.8.4 – Opening A: On their entrance tickets, students begin to think about the purpose of the performance task.

- SL.8.5 – Work Time A: Students analyze the model infographic and generate the criteria for an effective infographic.

- SL.8.5 – Work Time B: Students create their infographic, a visual representation of the claims in their argument essay.

- SL.8.6 – Work Time B: Students adapt text from their argument essays to create their infographic.

- W.8.5 – Closing and Assessment A: Students provide feedback to partners on their infographics using the criteria listed on the Performance Task Criteria anchor chart.

- SL.8.1 – Closing and Assessment A: Students engage in one-on-one collaborative discussion as they provide peer feedback to their partners on their infographics.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Encourage students to experiment with design functions to create their infographic. Students who are experts in design may circulate the room, offering their strengths to support other students.

- If time permits, provide additional in-class time for students to work on their infographics and to peer-review one another’s visuals to ensure quality and consistency.

- Invite students to find examples of other infographics online and to analyze how they present a compelling call to action. Students can share this with the class and explain what they think the designer has done well and what could be improved.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lessons, students wrote an argument essay for their end of unit assessment. In this lesson, students create a visual representation of the ideas in their essay in preparation to present to an audience for the roundtable presentations.

Support All Students

- Students may need additional support with using technology to create an infographic. Use strategic grouping to pair students with strong technology knowledge and skills with those students who may not be as comfortable with exploring and learning how to use new tools. Coordinate with the school’s technology teacher if applicable, to teach students to use software like Google Slides, PowerPoint, or Microsoft Word SmartArt to design their infographics. If able, invite professionals with design skills to help students with their infographic.

- Group students in home-language groups for Work Time A, in which students analyze model performance task materials. This will help students to focus on the content and topic during discussion. ▲

- Provide examples of infographics in students’ home languages to provide an example of this medium that may be more accessible. This will help students to deepen their understanding of the task and the purpose of an infographic. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson gives students the opportunity to analyze a model performance task based on a familiar topic: transportation choices. Students are then given time to transfer the content of their own essays into infographics. The use of collaborative discussions and pair work ensures that all students receive support in carrying out their planning and execution.

- ELLs may find it challenging to transfer the information from their essays into condensed points, particularly if they struggled with writing this essay. ELLs may also find it challenging to develop visual materials for their presentations within a limited period of time. Encourage students to plan ahead so that they can make the most of the time available. Group students strategically, pairing students with highly proficient peers to help ELLs navigate this process. Be mindful of pairing students with peers who speak the same home language, where possible, to allow for robust discussion around the task and content.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.7, 8.I.B.8, 8.I.C.9, and 8.I.C.10.

Assessment Guidance

- Review student work during and after the lesson either to provide specific feedback/suggestions or to identify common issues that could be used as whole group teaching points in the next lesson. Ensure that students are meeting the infographic criteria on the Performance Task Criteria anchor chart.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will create prompt cards and practice their presentations in preparation for the performance task.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 13, and ensure there is a copy at each student’s desk.

- Display the Performance Task anchor chart for the entrance ticket prompt.

- Explore design functions in one or more of the suggested software options to support students in creating their infographics in Work Time B.

- Prepare a digital version of the model infographic in Work Time A. If technology is not available, print the provided model versions.

- Work with a computer/technology teacher to support the use of computer software to develop an infographic digitally.

- Ensure art materials (e.g., colored pencils, scissors, crayons) are available for use by students who may wish to illustrate their infographic by hand.

- Consider how to engage and sustain effort and persistence throughout the lesson, as students will not be formally assessed on their performance task. Remind students of the many “real-world” applications of effective presentation skills and technical literacy. Focus students on the joy of learning for learning’s sake.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – SL.8.4 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **3**, **Lesson** **13**.

- Display the **Performance** **Task** **anchor** **chart**. Review student responses to the two questions from the entrance ticket.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What is the purpose of the performance task?” (Responses will vary, but may include: to inform people about how to make healthy and sustainable food choices and why it is important to do so.)

“What might audience members do with this information to help them in their lives?” (Responses will vary, but may include: be more aware of the foods they buy for themselves and others, choose healthier alternatives to the unhealthy foods they eat, prioritizing the buying of healthy food.)

- Explain to students that they will create an infographic that will visually convey the argument in their essay.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Analyze a Model Infographic – SL.8.5 (10 minutes)

- Remind students that in the previous lessons, they wrote their argument essay about an informed action that people in their community can take to make healthy and sustainable food choices. Students will use the argument in their essay to create an infographic for their performance task. This infographic will serve as a visual representation of their argument.

- Display the **Model** **Essay**: “ **Transportation** **Choices**,” and ask students to retrieve their copies. Review the author’s claim, points, reasoning, and evidence, using **Model** **Essay**: “ **Transportation** **Choices** ” (**example** **for** **teacher** **reference**).

- Display the **Performance** **Task**: **Model** **Infographic**. Have students analyze the model in pairs.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“How can the infographic help in a presentation? Why not just speak? What do visuals do?” (Responses will vary, but may include: it makes it more engaging, helps the audience better understand the key points, and helps the audience remember, as visuals can often help you remember information.)

“What did you notice about the visuals in that presentation?” (Responses will vary, but may include: ideas organized in shapes and arrows, not full sentences—key words and notes, simple and uncluttered, and easy to understand at a glance.)

- Display the **Performance** **Task** **Criteria** **anchor** **chart**. Select students to share out whole group, and record their responses on the Performance Task Criteria anchor chart, under the subheading “Infographic.” See **Performance** **Task** **Criteria** **anchor** **chart** (**for** **teacher** **reference**) for guidance.

For Lighter Support

- In advance of Work Time A, before students analyze the model performance task, invite them to skim the **Model Essay: “Transportation Choices,”** and to identify three things they notice and three things they wonder about how the author has used the essay to inform the design and content of the presentation and the materials. This will help students to draw deeper connections between the essay and the performance task as they conduct their analyses.

For Heavier Support

- After Work Time A, display examples of infographics that convey information about other topics, or have students conduct an internet search to find examples to share with the class. Students can discuss the infographics in small groups or as a whole class to deepen their understanding of how this medium conveys information.

Work Time

B. Create an Infographic – SL.8.5 (25 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can create a visual representation of my argument essay.”

- Instruct students to retrieve their **argument** **essays**. Give students a minute to review the claim, points, reasoning, and evidence in their essays.

- Tell students that they can draw illustrations on a sheet of paper or poster to create their infographic, or use technology to create their infographic.

- Allow students to choose how they would like to create their infographic. Organize the class into two pre-organized centers:

- Group A for students not using technology to create their infographic. Ensure these students have **art** **materials** (e.g., colored pencils, scissors, crayons).

- Group B for students using technology to create their infographic. Ensure these students have **paper** on which to draft some ideas before they begin.

- Ensure copies of the model are available for students to access for reference as they work. Start working with Group A first, and have Group B draft some ideas on their paper while they are waiting, if they are unsure about using the software provided.

- With Group B, model how to access software like Google Slides, PowerPoint, or Microsoft Word SmartArt. Show students how to use basic features: choosing a template, adding text, and inserting images.

- Circulate as students work to ensure they are staying on task and to support students using technology. Refer students to the Performance Task Criteria anchor chart to make sure they are focused on meeting the criteria for the infographic.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Closing and Assessment

A. Peer Feedback – W.8.5 (5 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can provide feedback to my peers to help them develop and strengthen their work.”

- Refocus the whole class.

- Instruct students to return to their partner from Work Time A. Tell students to exchange infographics with their partner.

- Explain to students that they will read their partner’s infographic and give each other feedback on how they can improve their visuals to better convey their argument.

- Display the following prompts, and remind students to refrain from simply stating what they like and dislike, but to give meaningful feedback:

- “The images/drawings in your infographic do a good job of showing . . . ”

- “I like the way you convey your argument using . . . ”

- “I think you can improve your infographic by . . . ”

- Display and focus students on the **Work** **to** **Become** **Ethical** **People** **anchor** **chart**, and remind them specifically of respect and compassion. Remind students that the purpose of peer feedback is to help the other student improve his or her work, so when we provide feedback, we have to be careful to ensure we are respectful and compassionate.

- Instruct students to begin.

- Circulate to support students as they work together to give feedback to one another. Refer students to the Performance Task Criteria anchor chart for the infographic criteria.

- Invite students to Think-Pair-Share:

“How will you address this feedback? Can you share specific strategies you have for revising this work?” (Responses will vary.)

“What questions do you have about the feedback you received?” (Responses will vary.)

- Clarify any feedback for students, and invite them to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

- As time allows, invite students to apply revisions. Express to students the importance of continuing to revise their infographics for homework, if they have not finished in class. In the next lesson, students will develop their speech that presents their infographic, so their infographic should be complete for the activity in the next lesson.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- Before the peer feedback exchange, review the Conversation Cues and discussion norms as a class to prepare students for the peer feedback portion of the lesson. Work as a class to generate a list of sentence starters based on these and other phrases that students can refer to while providing each other with feedback.

For Heavier Support

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent** **reading** **journal**.
