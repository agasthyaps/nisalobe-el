(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, read Proof Paragraph 2 from the Model Essay: “Transportation Choices,” and complete the tasks and question that follow it.

<u>In addition, public transportation is a good idea because it’s safe.</u> It’s well known that public transportation is safe for people who ride it, but a lesser known benefit is the safety it provides for the people living in those cities and towns. Communities with public transportation tend to build housing near that public transportation. An American Public Transit Association report from 2016 stated that “better public transportation contributes to more compact development.” This in turn “reduces auto-miles traveled and produces safer speeds in those areas” (Mackie, 2016). When people can travel fewer miles, and they go more slowly, there will be fewer accidents. This will be true even when people are not riding the public bus or train. It is clear that public transportation contributes to safety.**\*** It is the best choice for an individual, and also for communities overall.**\***
