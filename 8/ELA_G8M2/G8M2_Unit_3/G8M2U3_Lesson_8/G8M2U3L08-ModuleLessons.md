Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.8.1b – Opening A: Students answer questions as they analyze the role sentences play in Proof Paragraph 2 of the model argument essay.

- W.8.1b – Work Time A: Students use the Painted Essay® structure to more closely analyze a model Proof Paragraph, to understand how it supports a point/reason with valid reasoning and relevant evidence.

- W.8.1b – Work Time B: Students orally rehearse their second Proof Paragraph, sharing points, evidence, and the reasoning that connects back to the main claim.

- SL.8.4 – Work Time B: Students present the ideas for their second Proof Paragraph to a partner, determine whether they have relevant evidence and sound reasoning, and then make a plan to enhance their writing as needed.

- W.8.1b – Work Time C: Students work independently to draft their Proof Paragraph, choosing relevant evidence to support their claims and using logical reasoning to explain their thinking.

- W.8.5 – Work Time C: Students write a Proof Paragraph that includes a reason that supports the main claim with relevant evidence and sufficient reasoning.

- In this lesson, students use their Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer to draft Proof Paragraph 2 of their practice essays.

- Students focus on working to become effective learners, focusing on collaborating with peers while writing their practice essay and persevering to independently plan a Proof Paragraph.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release those students who are ready, to read and analyze the model Proof Paragraph 2 independently and then move on to drafting Proof Paragraph 2 of their practice essay.

- An optional Mini Language Dive, intended for use after students analyze the Proof Paragraph in Work Time A, is available in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Provide students with the opportunity to analyze the transitional words in the model essay. Consider partner work that supports students to identify words that signal sequence or transition in additional sources—reviewing informational texts from Unit 2, or selections of *The Omnivore’s Dilemma* for students to annotate. Synthesizing and listing transitional words on an anchor chart will enhance student understanding.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students worked in pairs to draft the first Proof Paragraph of their practice essay. This lesson builds upon that work as students write the second Proof Paragraph of their essay independently.

Support All Students

- Students may need additional support while writing Proof Paragraph 2 independently. Group these students together, and have a discussion to help them find the best evidence to support their points/reasons and elaborate on that evidence, providing reasoning to show it supports the point. ▲

- Although students have had practice creating accurate citations, provide various examples of accurate citations for students to view online or scribed on an anchor chart as they work to include relevant evidence in their Proof Paragraph. ▲

- Students may have limited argument writing experience and be unfamiliar with strong Proof Paragraphs, in this and other genres. Providing examples and scaffolded support (sentence stems, annotated graphic organizers, models of Proof Paragraphs and opportunities to talk through their ideas) will help their writing. If needed, pull a small group to review this aspect of argument writing. ▲

- In Work Time A, students will be guided to use the visual concept of an “evidence sandwich” as a way of identifying and analyzing the parts of a Proof Paragraph. They will use this both to deconstruct the model essay, and to help guide the planning and writing of their own practice essays. ▲

- Pull small instructional groups who need more scaffolding and support. Students might need extended verbal processing time to develop their reasoning statements. ▲

- Consistently referring to the model argument essay will act as a support for students who need reminders of what strong writing looks like. ▲

- Providing written and verbal directions, and charting the steps they will take on an anchor chart, could help students as they plan for their writing. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson follows the same pattern as Lessons 6 and 7. Students participate in a series of scaffolded tasks that guide students from analysis to independent writing. Students work in groups to analyze Proof Paragraph 2 of the model essay before planning and writing Proof Paragraph 2 of the practice argument essay. Like the two previous lessons, this lesson is highly collaborative and includes ample time for discussion, oral planning, and peer feedback.

- ELLs may find it challenging to complete their own written version of the practice essay in this series of lessons. Pair ELLs thoughtfully with supportive peers who can help them navigate the complexities of the task sequencing and the tasks themselves, and encourage students to refer back to the model essay, the text, and the Argument Writing checklist, frequently, while writing.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.C.11 and 8.I.C.12.

Assessment Guidance

- Use the Grade 8 Writing Process checklist to assess students’ writing abilities in Work Times B and C (see the Tools page at http://eled.org/tools).

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will write the counterclaim of their practice argument essay. In Lesson 10, students will work on their conclusions and then write an independent argument essay during their End of Unit 3 Assessment in Lessons 11–12.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 8, and ensure there is a copy at each student’s workspace.

- Strategically pair students for work in Opening A, with at least one strong reader per pair.

- Review the Argument Writing checklist to become familiar with what will be required of students over the remainder of the unit.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time C: Prepare devices with word-processing capabilities for students to continue drafting.

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous modules to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.8.1b (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance** **Ticket**: **Unit** **3**, **Lesson** **8**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- As in Lesson 7, after Opening A, allow students to spend time working with partners to generate opening and closing sentences for Proof Paragraph 2 of their Practice Argument Essay immediately following the analysis and discussion of the topic and closing sentences in Proof Paragraph 2 of the model essay, to allow for direct transfer of learning. Invite students to share their sentences with other groups to check the clarity of connections between their claims and topic and closing sentences.

Work Time

A. Analyze the Model: Proof Paragraph 2 – W.8.1b (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify the reasons, evidence, and reasoning in Proof Paragraph 2 of a model argument essay.”

- Remind students that one of the most important aspects of a Proof Paragraph is including evidence that directly supports the reason stated. The “evidence sandwich” includes three parts:

- The reason (bread)

- The evidence introduced with context (the filling)

- The reasoning (more bread)

- Display **Model** **Essay**: “ **Transportation** **Choices**,” and ask students to retrieve their Model Essay: “Transportation Choices.” Read Proof Paragraph 2 aloud, prompting students to think about these three components of a Proof Paragraph as they follow along.

- Have students practice identifying the important aspects of a Proof Paragraph by finding and discussing the “evidence sandwich” in Proof Paragraph 2 of their Model Essay: “Transportation Choices.”

- Turn and Talk:

“What is the reason/bread in Proof Paragraph 2?” (“In addition, public transportation is a good idea because it’s safe.”)

“What context does the writer give the reader before each piece of evidence?” (information about the safety of public transportation)

“What is the evidence/filling in Proof Paragraph 2?” (“An American Public Transit Association report from 2016 stated that ‘Better public transportation contributes to more compact development.’ This in turn ‘reduces auto-miles traveled and produces safer speeds in those areas.’ (Mackie, 2016)”).

“How is this evidence introduced?” (“It’s well known that public transportation is safe for people who ride it, but a lesser known benefit is the safety it provides for the people living in those cities and towns. Communities with public transportation tend to build housing near that public transportation.”)

“What is the reasoning/bread in Proof Paragraph 2?” (“When people can travel fewer miles, and they go more slowly, there will be fewer accidents. This will be true even when people are not riding the public bus or train. It is clear that public transportation contributes to safety. It is the best choice for an individual, and also for communities overall.”)

- Circulate as students complete the task, clarifying any misconceptions and answering questions.

- Display the **Characteristics** **of** **Argument** **Writing** **anchor** **chart**. Review aspects of Proof Paragraphs with students. Invite students to help record additional important aspects of Proof Paragraphs on the anchor chart.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Work Time

B. Orally Rehearse Proof Paragraph 2 – W.8.5 (10 minutes)

- Ask students to join their practice essay partner. Provide students an opportunity to verbally review or add to the plan they created for Proof Paragraph 2 of their Practice Essay, planned in Lesson 5. Students should verbally rehearse each evidence sandwich they plan on using in their practice essay Proof Paragraph: the reason, the related evidence identified, and reasoning they planned, orally rehearsing the sentences they may write.

- As applicable, support students by prompting pairs to ask each other the following three questions:

“What will you write as your reason/bread?” (Responses should identify the reasons students already planned together in Lesson 5.)

“What will you write as your context and evidence/filling?” (Responses will vary.)

“What will you write as your reasoning/bread?” (Responses will vary.)

- Provide time for students to make revisions to their plans as needed. Students will use the updated plans to draft Proof Paragraph 2 independently.

Work Time

C. Practice Essay: Draft Proof Paragraph 2 – W.8.1b (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can write Proof Paragraph 2 for my practice essay.”

- Tell students they are now ready to draft Proof Paragraph 2 of their practice essays. Explain to students that they will draft Proof Paragraph 2 independently.

- Remind them to use the same series of questions used in the rehearsal to guide their writing.

- “What is your reason (bread)?”

- “What is your context and evidence/filling?”

- “What is your reasoning/bread?”

- Invite students to retrieve their **devices**, gather any remaining materials from the list below, and refer to the Characteristics of Argument Writing anchor chart as they write:

- Model Essay: “Transportation Choices”

- **Argument** **Writing** **checklist**

- **Painted** **Essay** ® **template**

- ***The Omnivore’s Dilemma***

- **Practice** **Argument** **Essay** **Writing** **Plan** **graphic** **organizer**

- Circulate to support students as they write and to identify common issues to use as whole group teaching points.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Closing and Assessment

A. Pair-Share: Proof Paragraph 2 – W.8.1b (5 minutes)

- Organize students into their pairs from Work Time B.

- Display and invite students to retrieve their copies of the Argument Writing checklist. Point out the following criteria on the checklist:

- W.8.1a

- W.8.1b

- Invite partners to swap Proof Paragraphs, with partner A reading the work partner B did on Proof Paragraph 2, and vice versa, paying attention to the criteria listed above.

- Ask students to share relevant feedback and to note any necessary revisions.

- As necessary, ask questions such as:

“What strengths can you identify in your partner’s work?”

“What next steps can you name for your partner?”

- Invite students to record “Y” for *Yes* and the date in the final column of their Argument Writing checklist if they feel the criteria marked on their checklists have been achieved in their writing in this lesson. Remind students to revise Proof Paragraph 2, as needed.

For Lighter Support

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from Model Essay: “Transportation Choices” to explore how a writer connects a counterclaim to the main argument in an essay. Provide ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Invite students who need lighter support to predict some of the questions that the Language Dive may ask. This will improve students’ metacognition and challenge their awareness of the most interesting or meaningful elements of the sentence.

For Heavier Support

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from Model Essay: “Transportation Choices” to explore how a writer connects a counterclaim to the main argument in an essay. Provide ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Encourage students who need heavier support to independently reflect on this sentence and its meaning before the next lesson. Students may also wish to add any unknown vocabulary to their vocabulary logs.

Homework

A. Revise Proof Paragraph 2

- Students revise Proof Paragraph 2 of their practice argument essay, based on feedback and criteria.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent** **reading** **journal**.
