Close Reading Guide: “Often a Minute”

RL.8.1, RL.8.4, RL.8.5, L.8.5

(For Teacher Reference)

**Purpose and Notes**

- The purpose of this close read is for students to analyze the poem “Often A Minute” to see how the structure of the poem contributes to the meaning or theme. To do so, they will focus on the stanza structure of the text and how the poet uses that structure to build meaning. In addition, students will explore how the structure within each stanza contributes to the overall meaning. Finally, students will work with figurative language in the text.

- Read the poem aloud, and prompt students to read along silently. During a second reading, frequently, the teacher will have students reread portions of the text in order to answer text-dependent questions.

- Students work in pairs for this close read.

- A note-catcher along with text-dependent questions provide an opportunity for students to respond to the text-dependent questions. The last three questions on this note-catcher serve as a culminating task.

- Continue to use discussion protocols (e.g., Turn and Talk, cold call, and total participation techniques) to engage all students in collaborative discussion about the text.

<li><p>Distribute the Close Read: “Often a Minute” note-catcher. Explain to students that they are about to read a poem written by a young woman who experienced and survived the Holocaust. Provide background information on Magdalena Klein, who was the youngest daughter of a middle-class Jewish family. Her family was taken to a ghetto and then a concentration camp. She survived but passed away shortly after the war ended.</p></li>
<li><p>Explain that poetry is an oral medium, like a cross between prose and music. Just as we listen to music to get the feel of it, even before we pay attention to the words, it helps to listen to a poem before actually reading it.</p></li>

<li><p>Ask: “How does the poet feel in this first stanza? What words in the poem help you understand how the poet is feeling?” (She feels fearful—uses words like <strong>fright</strong>, <strong>afraid</strong>, and <strong>persecution</strong>.)</p></li>
