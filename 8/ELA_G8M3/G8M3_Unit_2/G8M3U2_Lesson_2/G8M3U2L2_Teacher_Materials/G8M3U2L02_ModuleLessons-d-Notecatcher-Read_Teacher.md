**“Often a Minute”**

**by Magdalena Klein**

1\] Often a minute, a day, seems so slight.

My eyes glance at the news with fright

And I’m afraid to turn the radio on,

For again I hear of Jewish persecution.

2\] First Germany, then Vienna:

Today Italy also enters the arena.

Even she can’t stand these people

Who never did her any evil.

3\] They haven’t harmed, yet are disliked

And thrown prey to insult.

The youth that longs to live,

Is choked before it has a chance to breathe.

4\] Why are we uselessly persecuted?

Why is our fate so desolate?

5\] But fight and contempt give us strength

To bear the filth of hatred.

And shaking off every speck of dust

This indestructible nation shall stand just.

6\] For Jewish brothers, let’s not despair!

Our day, too, shall once come through

And the sun will brightly be shining.

Brothers, the Jewish spring will be arriving!
