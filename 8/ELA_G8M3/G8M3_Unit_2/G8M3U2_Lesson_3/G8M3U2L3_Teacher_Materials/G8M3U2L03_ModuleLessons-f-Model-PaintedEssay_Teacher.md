(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Prompt:** Write an essay in which you compare the theme of *Maus I* and “Often a Minute,” and analyze how the differing structures contribute to that theme.

W.8.2a: Context given before  
focus is stated.

W.8.9, R.8.1: Focus shows clear understanding of theme and structure.  
  
W.8.2a: Clear and specific points mention each text using a differing structure, and support the focus.  
  
RL.8.5: The structures of *Maus I* and “Often a Minute” are analyzed to show how the structure contributes to meaning and style.

W.8.2d, L.8.6: Precise language and domain-specific vocabulary, such as **persecution**, **Nazi**, and **horrendous**, are used.

Throughout history, humans have encountered adversity and challenges in large or small ways. The Holocaust is one of the most horrible cases of persecution and oppression in the history of the world. When reading about this topic, it is amazing to see the sense of strong will to live evident in many victims and survivors. Two texts that we have read, *Maus I* and “Often a Minute,” explore the topic of the human spirit of perseverance and will to live in the face of terrible oppression. Each text comes to a nuanced theme about this same topic. Each text also uses a different structure to convey that theme to the reader.

The graphic novel *Maus I* conveys the topic of the horrendous persecution experienced by Jewish people during the Holocaust. The main character, Vladek Spiegelman, relays his story of survival to his son in this book. Vladek tells of the many difficult, life-or-death choices he had to make in order to keep himself and his family alive. Vladek made a difficult choice to send his first son away, somewhere he thought he would be safe during the Nazi persecution. However, his son did not survive. When Vladek’s wife learns of this news, she does not want to go on any longer. Yet Vladek tells her, “To die, it’s easy. . . but you have to *struggle* for life,” and he explains how they must move forward together (122). This develops the theme that there is a strong human will to keep oneself and one’s family alive, despite tragedy and oppression.

The poem “Often a Minute” also explores the topic of persecution and the human will to survive. In this poem, Magdalena Klein tells of the fear and confusion she is experiencing. She has been hearing of the persecution of Jewish people across many European countries, despite having done nothing wrong. As she expresses her fear and anger, Klein also speaks to the Jewish people as a whole. She says, “Let’s not despair!” She adds, “This indestructible nation will stand just” (stanzas 5–6). Similarly to Spiegelman, Klein explores the topic of the human will to survive and persevere in the face of oppression. However, she does not focus on the survival of herself and her family. Instead, Magdalena conveys a broader theme of the will for an entire nation of people to persevere and survive.

In each text, the writer uses a particular and effective structure to express the meaning of the text. *Maus I* uses a largely chronological structure to relay Vladek’s story. From the very beginning of this story, Vladek experiences a series of challenges and threats to the life of himself and his family. Vladek is repeatedly faced with unimaginable decisions to make. He repeatedly centers his life, and the life of his family, as the basis for all of his choices. For example, Vladek was drafted into the army but was able to get out. He journeyed very far, through dangerous conditions, to find his way back to his family (47–65). The chronological plot structure of *Maus I* emphasizes the many challenges and choices Vladek must face. This highlights the theme that humans have an incredible will to survive and to protect their family.

W.8.2b: Relevant quotations from the texts are used to explain thinking.

W.8.2c: Transitions such as “in each text” used to connect ideas.

W.8.2a: A compare/contrast strategy is used to organize information.

In contrast, “Often a Minute” uses a different structure. The poem is divided into stanzas that show a shift in Klein’s thoughts and tone. In the first four stanzas, Klein reflects on the current state of Jewish oppression in Europe. Her tone is fearful, confused, and angry. She asks, “Why are we uselessly persecuted? / Why is our fate so desolate?” (stanza 4). However, in stanza 5, Klein’s thoughts and tone begin to shift. She becomes determined and charges the Jewish people to maintain faith and solidarity. Klein boldly claims, “The Jewish spring will be arriving!” (stanza 6). The structure shows a shift in thought and tone. This develops the theme that the human will to survive and persevere can extend to an entire nation of people who stand together.

In conclusion, these two texts explore a similar topic of human survival and persistence in the face of oppression. However, each text arrives at a nuanced version of a similar theme.  
*Maus I* focuses on the survival of self and will that one’s family should survive. “Often a Minute” express the will of an entire people to stand in solidarity and endure. These texts use differing structures to support and convey each theme. The intentional use of structure for message is an important way of making literature memorable for readers. In this case, each text effectively conveys powerful messages about human endurance.

W.8.4 (partial), W.8.2e: Words like “in conclusion” and “each text arrives at a nuanced version of the same theme” are used to convey a formal style.

W.8.2f: Conclusion supports the focus about different structures conveying theme.
