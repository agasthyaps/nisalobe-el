Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.8.4 – Work Time A – Students read the Literary Analysis Informative Essay Directions and analyze the task, looking at purpose and audience and thinking about the idea development and organization to be used in the essay.

- RL.8.2 – Work Time B – Students use the Painted Essay® structure to more closely analyze the theme of a text and understand its relationship to the characters, setting, and plot.

- W.8.2a – Work Time B – Students use the Painted Essay® structure to more closely analyze a model introduction to note how it effectively introduces the topic and states a focus.

- W.8.4 – Work Time B – Students work to plan clear and coherent introductions for their assessment essays, showing a clear understanding of the task, determining the purpose of the piece, and anticipating the context needed by the reader.

- W.8.2b – Work Time C: Students use the Painted Essay® structure to more closely analyze the first Proof Paragraphs of a model to understand how they effectively develop the topic with well-chosen details and examples from the text.

- W.8.4 – Work Time C: Students work to plan their first Proof Paragraphs, choosing the best evidence to support Point 1 and elaborating on or explaining how it does so.

- RL.8.1 – Closing and Assessment A: Students join with partners and share the plan for their first Proof Paragraphs, identifying the evidence they chose to support each point and the elaboration to explain it.

- W.8.5 – Closing and Assessment A – Students provide feedback to strengthen the evidence and elaboration in their literary analysis essay plan.

- In this lesson, students analyze the Literary Analysis Model Essay: Relationship of Structure to Meaning and use the model to plan their own essays, where they analyze the similarities and differences in theme and structure in *Maus I* and “Often a Minute” and explain how these contribute to meaning.

- In Closing and Assessment A, students give and receive peer feedback on students’ informative writing plan, concentrating on supporting the focus in clear Proof Paragraphs with evidence and elaboration (W.8.2a, W.8.2b). If time permits, allow more time for peer review looking for common issues students may struggle with.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become ethical people by showing integrity as they discuss ideas from the model and by showing respect and empathy as they plan their essays, reflecting on Magdalena Klein’s experience in “Often a Minute” and Art Spiegelman’s experience in *Maus I*.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Invite students to research more about the Holocaust and to ask their family members what they know about this time period. Students can share what they learn in small groups or with the class as a whole.

- Release those students who are ready to read and analyze the model introduction and Proof Paragraphs independently and then move on to planning Proof Paragraphs for Point 1 independently rather than with modeling.

- Have students generate additional questions that they can ask their peers during the peer feedback exchange in Closing and Assessment A. Students can base these off questions they have about their own writing or criteria that they have identified as especially challenging. Compile a list of student-generated questions, distributing or displaying them, and invite students to select ones that they would like to ask their partners.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lessons, students analyzed a model essay that explored how the structure contributes to meaning in “The Blind Man and the Elephant” and in *Summer of the Mariposas*. Students also did a close read of the poem, “Often a Minute,” which is the poem students will compare to *Maus I* in their assessment essay. Today, students review the introduction and Proof Paragraphs of the model essay and use the understanding of the structure and meaning in “Often a Minute” and *Maus I* built in the previous lesson to plan the introduction and first Proof Paragraphs of their assessment essay.

Support All Students

- Pair students (especially ELLs) thoughtfully for pair share to build supportive and safe exchange. Vary these partners throughout the unit to expose students to diverse perspectives one-on-one. ▲

- Presenting learning targets and directions in writing, orally, and if possible, accompanied by symbols will help students to understand the language within them. ▲

- Much of this lesson is discussion based, so consider how to best support students who need additional support with oral language and/or auditory processing. ▲

- Students may need additional support while planning their Proof Paragraphs. Group those students for a guided discussion to find the best evidence to support their point and elaborate on that evidence, showing how it supports the point. ▲

- For ELLs especially, understanding the construction of a strong Proof Paragraph may be difficult if isolated language is unknown. Provide annotations of a glossary of new terms to help students navigate their work with the model. ▲

- Use large print strips for sentences in Proof Paragraphs that students can manipulate and reorganize. Consider using different colors for text or highlights to draw students’ attention to key features. ▲

- The graphic organizer/matching activity using model essay can be incorporated if students need additional support in digesting body paragraph content. ▲

- Give students time to talk through their Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer with a partner before writing or to use a voice recorder to talk through what they will include in paragraphs. ▲

- Some students may feel awkward providing feedback to their peers or may not know how to formulate constructive suggestions. Use criteria lists and sentence starters to help guide the discussion during the peer feedback portion of the lesson. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson includes time spent analyzing a model informative essay that compares a familiar text, *Summer of the Mariposas*, with a poem before then writing an essay that focuses on analyzing the similarities and differences in theme and structure in *Maus I* and “Often a Minute” and the way in which these contribute to meaning. The lesson also includes time for peer feedback and collaborative discussion to help students improve their writing while also practicing oral skills.

- ELLs may find it challenging to understand portions of the model essay. While *Summer of the Mariposas* will be quite familiar to students, the poem that this text is compared to in the model is not something students will have a deep understanding of. Encourage students to focus on the structure of the essay and the way in which the author crafts points about similarities and differences. Remind students that for their own essays, they will be working with texts that they know well.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6 and 8.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- Consider using the Grade 8 Writing Process checklist to assess students’ writing abilities in Work Time B (located on the Tools Page at http://eled.org/tools).

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will analyze the second set of Proof Paragraphs and the conclusion from the model essay and create a plan for these two sections of their Literary Analysis Informative Essay.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.8.1a (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 3**.

- Prompt students to Turn and Talk about their answers to the entrance ticket. Cold-call students to share out. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 3 (answer for teacher reference)**.

- Using a preferred classroom routine, collect or review the answers to **Homework: Language, Structure, and Theme** assigned in Lesson 2. Refer to the **Homework: Language, Structure, and Theme (example for teacher reference)**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Introduce the Literary Analysis Essay Prompt – W.8.4 (5 Minutes)

- Explain that students will be writing their own literary analysis essays in Lessons 5–6. Remind students that they have had a lot of practice with informative essays this year. Literary analysis essays are a type of informative essay that examines literature. Tell students:

“In this essay, you will be asked to explain similarities and differences in the structure and meaning of two texts. This work will be similar to the work you’ve done in previous lessons, and you will have practice analyzing a model and planning for the essay you write in Lesson 5–6. The particular essay you will be writing will also have a compare and contrast structure.”

- Display and distribute **Literary Analysis Informative Essay directions**. Read the directions aloud and ask students to follow along, annotating the text.

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What is the topic of your essay? Put the prompt in your own words and share it with your partner.” (Students will need to compare and contrast the structure of *Maus I* and “Often a Minute.” They will analyze how the differing structures of each text contribute to its meaning.)

- Ask students to brainstorm with a partner:

“What are some of the steps you will need to go through as a writer to successfully answer this literary analysis prompt?” (Answers will vary, but could include the following: reread the texts, review the themes and structure in the texts, look for evidence about themes and structure, write successful Proof Paragraphs, etc.)

- Tell students that in this lesson, they will roughly sketch out what will go into the introduction and first two Proof Paragraphs. In the following lessons, they will plan the rest of their Proof Paragraphs and their conclusion.

- Answer any questions that come up about the directions for the essay.

Work Time

B. Analyze a Model and Plan Introduction – W.8.2a (10 minutes)

- Direct students’ attention to the posted learning target and select a volunteer to read it aloud:

“I can identify the purpose of each part of the introduction of a model literary analysis and use this understanding to plan the introduction of my own literary analysis.”

- Direct students to the **Characteristics of a Literary Analysis Essay anchor chart**, and ask students to read the section related to an introduction.

- Prompt students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What are the characteristics of a strong introductory paragraph in a literary analysis essay?” (Students should mention the criteria listed, noting that an introduction needs to catch the reader’s attention and give context and then provide a clear focus statement that answers the prompt.)

“What does a writer need to include in his or her informative essay introduction if it is also a compare and contrast literary analysis essay?” (The writer needs to name the similarities and differences they will write about, and name each text.)

- Display the **Model Literary Analysis Essay: Relationship of Structure to Meaning**, and prompt students to retrieve their copies. Reread the introduction of the model essay aloud as students follow along silently. Ask students to underline the first sentence of the paragraph. Tell students that this sentence describes the topic.

- Ask students to underline the next four sentences. Using a total participation technique, collect responses from the group:

“What job do these sentences do in the introduction?” (These sentences give background and further explain the topic to the reader. They narrow in on the focus that is about to be presented and name the texts used in the essay.)

- Tell students that the last two sentences of the introduction are the focus statement.

- Prompt students to reread the focus statement, underlining it in green. Tell students that the first sentence of the focus, “\[t\]wo texts that we have read, *Summer of the Mariposas* and ‘The Blind Men and the Elephant’ explore this topic of encountering new ideas or people,” introduces the focus, and the next sentence names the points that support the focus. Tell students that the part of the focus “\[e\]ach comes to a different theme about the topic” is the point that will be explained with evidence in the first two yellow Proof Paragraphs, and the part of the focus “each uses a different structure to make that theme clear to the reader” is the point that will be explained in the second two blue Proof Paragraphs. Direct students to note this on their model essays.

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“How is this introduction paragraph similar to ones you have written in previous essays?” (It has a similar structure to most introductions they have written. It introduces the topic and gives some context. It has a focus statement and identifies two points the essay will develop. It is different in content—it will address the theme and structure used in the texts.)

- Direct students to their **Informative Writing checklist**, and prompt them to add specific characteristics of this essay in the “Characteristics of This Informative Writing Piece” column.

- Explain that students will now plan the introduction of their own essays and create a focus statement that answers the question about the similarities and differences in the structure and meaning of *Maus I* and “Often a Minute.”

- Display and distribute the **Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer**. Remind students that they used a similar graphic organizer to plan their informative essays in Module 1, and tell them that this one is slightly different because it aligns to the four Proof Paragraphs this essay contains and will be discussed in more detail in Work Time C.

- Review the section of the graphic organizer pertaining to the introduction, and ask volunteers to explain what kinds of information they will plan in this section. Tell students they will review the rest of the graphic organizer in Work Time C.

- Explain to students that they will use this graphic organizer independently to plan their literary analysis essay. Remind students that in previous essays, they have worked with partners to plan their essays and in this lesson they will work independently.

- Prompt students to Turn and Talk, giving them an opportunity to orally rehearse the introduction and focus statement they might use in their literary analysis essay plan.

- If students are ready to begin planning the introduction of their essay independently, release them to do so. Remind students that they don’t need to write complete sentences in their graphic organizer. They can just take notes.

- Offer students options for writing utensils. Also, consider offering partial dictation of student responses.

- Circulate to support students as they plan. Refer to **Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer (example for teacher reference)** and the **Literary Analysis Informative Essay: Sample Student Response (example for teacher reference)** as needed. If necessary, prompt by asking questions or providing sentence starters as necessary: ▲

“What topic do both texts explore?” (They both explore the topic of perseverance and the will to survive.)

“What themes does each develop about this topic?” (Answers will vary.)

- Direct students to the Characteristics of a Literary Analysis Essay anchor chart. Read aloud each bullet related to the introduction, and ask students to point to that characteristic in their plan.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time B, have students use the Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer to analyze the Model Literary Analysis Essay: Relationship of Structure to Meaning. By working backwards to connect the elements of the model essay to this planner, students will better understand each element of the essay before they begin planning their own writing.

Work Time

C. Analyze a Model and Plan Proof Paragraphs 1a and 1b – W.8.2b (20 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify the structure and purpose of each part of a Proof Paragraph and use this understanding to plan the Proof Paragraphs of my own literary analysis.”

- Tell students they will now analyze the first two Proof Paragraphs of the model essay. Inform students that in this essay there are two yellow Proof Paragraphs for point 1, Proof Paragraph 1a and Proof Paragraph 1b. Both support the first yellow point of the focus statement, but they use different texts to do so. Read aloud the first Proof Paragraph as students follow along silently. Model for students, underlining the evidence with a wavy line and the elaboration with a straight line, directing students to capture the annotations on their model as well. Use the **Analyze a Model: Proof Paragraphs 1a and 1b (example for teacher reference)** for guidance.

- Point out that there are a lot of wavy lines, as much of the paragraph is evidence, and only a small part of it is elaboration. Explain that this is different from how evidence and elaboration have looked before, in other model essays, but it’s still evidence and elaboration.

- Say:

“The way the sentences are organized in the paragraph is different because the task of this essay is different; therefore, the thinking has to look a little different. Although the amounts of evidence and elaboration are different in this essay, the Proof Paragraph structure should still feel similar to other writing you have done. The evidence presents many examples related to the topic (in this case experiencing new ideas and people) and a smaller amount of elaboration (in this case that explains this evidence and names the theme).”

- Direct students back to the model. Read aloud and circle the transitions as students follow along. Use Analyze a Model: Proof Paragraphs 1a and 1b (example for teacher reference) as a guide. Remind students that transitions can be words or phrases, pointing out “over the course of a story” as an example, and make sure they know it is a transition. Ask:

“What job do the transitional words and phrases do in this paragraph? How are they helpful?” (Answers will vary: students should recognize that they help guide the reader through the paragraph, provide sequencing and connect ideas for the reader so that the writing makes sense.)

- Use a total participation technique to share responses with the group.

- Prompt students to find a partner, labelling themselves partner A and partner B, and locate Proof Paragraph 1b, the second yellow Proof Paragraph. Direct partner A to read Proof Paragraph 1b aloud while partner B underlines the evidence with a wavy line and the elaboration with a straight line. Together, have partners find and circle the transitional words and phrases.

- Cold-call on students to share the evidence, elaboration, and transitions they identified with the group. Address any questions, and use any misconceptions as whole group teaching points.

- Display and distribute the **Analyze a Model: Proof Paragraphs 1a and 1b**, and describe how it is organized. Explain that it breaks the Proof Paragraphs into chunks. Each chunk of the Proof Paragraph is listed on the left, and the job that text plays in the paragraph is listed on the right. Transitional words and phrases are also listed on the right.

- Read through the first section of the handout, for Proof Paragraph 1a, showing how it explains the job of each part of the paragraph and connecting it to the annotating they did. Answer any questions students may have.

- Direct students to the first section for Proof Paragraph 1b, reading the paragraph element/chunk of text and the related job of the text. Prompt students to work with their partner to complete the remaining sections for Proof Paragraph 1b, recording the job of the evidence and the elaboration, and noting any transitional words. Circulate, using any questions or misconceptions as common teaching points and referring to Analyze a Model: Proof Paragraphs 1a and 1b (example for teacher reference) to ensure that students are identifying the correct job aligned to the evidence and elaboration in Proof Paragraph 1b.

- Using a total participation technique, invite responses from the group:

“How is the evidence used similar to or different from the evidence used in Proof Paragraph 1a?” (Responses will vary, but may include the following: the evidence is arranged sequentially in both, and in both paragraphs the evidence summarizes the story or poem through the lens of how it relates to the topic of exploring new and different people and ideas.)

“How is the elaboration similar to or different from the elaboration used in Proof Paragraph 1a?” (Responses will vary, but may include the following: The elaboration in Proof Paragraph 1a names a theme, but in Proof Paragraph 1b it names a theme and then also mentions how the themes are different. The elaboration is similar in that it briefly explains the evidence and points to the theme that emerged.)

- Direct students to the Characteristics of a Literary Analysis Essay anchor chart and review the sections related to Proof Paragraph(s) 1. Remind students that Proof Paragraph 1a and 1b are a set, both working together to support the first point named in their focus statement. Work with students to add specific characteristics of this essay in the “Characteristics of This Informative Writing Piece” column of their Informative Writing checklist. Field any questions students have about the evidence and elaboration is used in the first set of Proof Paragraphs, and clarify any misconceptions.

- Explain that students will now plan the first two Proof Paragraphs of their own essays, explaining similarities and differences in the structure and how that impacts meaning of *Maus I* and “Often a Minute.”

- Show students that the Proof Paragraph sections of their Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer are slightly different because the planner aligns to the four Proof Paragraphs the model essay contains. As needed, point students back to the model to further discuss the use of the Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer for these two paragraphs.

- Prompt students to use their Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer as a guide to orally rehearse any ideas they have for the first two Proof Paragraphs of their essays.

- Tell students that if they are ready, they should plan the first two Proof Paragraphs. Remind students that they should work independently and consider the texts *Maus I* and the “Often a Minute” for evidence to explain their points.

- Circulate to support students as they plan. Refer to Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer (example for teacher reference) and the Literary Analysis Informative Essay: Sample Student Response (example for teacher reference) as needed. If necessary, prompt by asking questions or providing sentence starters as necessary: ▲

“What themes emerge in each text about these topics?” (One theme developed in *Maus I* is about the immeasurably strong human will to keep oneself and one’s family alive, despite tragedy and oppression, and a theme developed in “Often a Minute” also is focused on the will to survive in the face of tragedy but includes for an entire nation of people to persevere and survive.)

“How are these themes similar and different?” (Answers will vary.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time C, have students use the Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer to analyze the Model Literary Analysis Essay: Relationship of Structure to Meaning. By working backwards to connect the elements of the model essay to this planner, students will better understand each element of the essay before they begin planning their own writing.

For Heavier Support

- After students have finished their analysis during Work Time C, distribute a copy of the Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer with information from the introduction and Proof Paragraphs Model Literary Analysis Essay: Relationship of Structure to Meaning filled in. Students can use this a model to guide their own work as they plan their essays.

Closing and Assessment

A. Pair Share: Evidence and Elaboration – W.8.5 (5 minutes)

- Invite students to join a partner and have their Informative Writing checklist in front of them.

- Remind students that, as discussed in Work Time C, one important criterion for planning and writing effective Proof Paragraphs is

- “W.8.2b: I use relevant facts, definitions, details, quotations, and examples to explain my thinking.”

- Tell students that meeting this criterion means they have chosen the best evidence for the topic and elaborated on it to reveal the theme in the text.

- Invite students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What is one piece of best evidence you found and included in the plan for your Proof Paragraph 1 about *Maus I*? Why is it strong evidence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How did you elaborate on or explain the connection between the evidence and your main point in the plan for your Proof Paragraph 1 about *Maus I*?” (Responses will vary but should mention how the elaboration relates the evidence to the themes that emerged in the text.)

- Invite students to give each other feedback on the evidence and elaboration planned.

- Prompt students to repeat these two questions, sharing the evidence and elaboration they plan to use in their Proof Paragraph 1b about “Often a Minute.”

- As time allows, ask volunteers to share their responses with the class.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- Display relevant Goal 2 and 3 Conversation Cues with expected responses at the beginning of the pair share to help guide the discussion and to deepen thinking and understanding:

- “Can you say more about that?” (“Sure. I think that \_\_\_\_\_.”)

- “Can you give an example?” (“No, sorry, that’s not what I mean. I mean \_\_\_\_\_.”)

- “Why do you think that?”(“Because \_\_\_\_\_.”)

- “What, in the (sentence/text), makes you think so?” (If you look at \_\_\_\_\_, it says \_\_\_\_\_, which means \_\_\_\_\_.”)

For Heavier Support

- In advance of the pair share, have students underline the facts, definitions, details, and quotations they have included in their essay before sharing their work with a partner. This will help students to review their own work and serve to guide their peer in noticing how this information has been incorporated into the essay. Students can then focus on discussing the relevance of each fact, definition, detail, and quotation for a more robust discussion.

Homework

A. Read a Poem and Answer Questions

- Students complete **Homework: Structure and Meaning: “The Owl”** to answer selected and constructed response questions about structure and meaning.
