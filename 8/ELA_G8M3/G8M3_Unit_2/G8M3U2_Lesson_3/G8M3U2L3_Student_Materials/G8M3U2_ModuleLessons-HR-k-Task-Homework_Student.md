**“Often a Minute” by Magdalena Klein**

Often a minute, a day, seems so slight.

My eyes glance at the news with fright

And I’m afraid to turn the radio on,

For again I hear of Jewish persecution.

First Germany, then Vienna:

Today Italy also enters the arena.

Even she can’t stand these people

Who never did her any evil.

They haven’t harmed, yet are disliked

And thrown prey to insult.

The youth that longs to live,

Is choked before it has a chance to breathe.

Why are we uselessly persecuted?

Why is our fate so desolate?

But fight and contempt give us strength

To bear the filth of hatred.

And shaking off every speck of dust

This indestructible nation shall stand just.

For Jewish brothers, let’s not despair!

Our day, too, shall once come through

And the sun will brightly be shining.

Brothers, the Jewish spring will be arriving!
