Proof Paragraphs: What does it look like to “support the focus with evidence” in this literary analysis?

Focus Statement

Two texts that we have read, *The Summer of the Mariposas* and “The Blind Men and the Elephant,” explore this topic of encountering new ideas or people. Each comes to a different theme about the topic, and each uses a different structure to make that theme clear to the reader.

Over the course of the story, Odilia keeps encountering La Llorona. She realizes that what she thought was true of La Llorona is not true. By the end of the story, in fact, Odilia comes to realize that La Llorona is a suffering but loving figure who has been helping Odilia and her sisters all along the way.
