5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

W.8.2f, L.8.1a, L.8.5b

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

The intentional use of structure for message is **an important way of making literature memorable for readers!** (from paragraph 6 of Model Literary Analysis Essay: Relationship of Structure to Meaning)

**Lesson 4 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after students analyze the model essay in Work Time A.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target **(I can identify the purpose of each part of the conclusion of a model literary analysis and plan the conclusion of my own literary analysis)** and W.8.2f by providing an example of a sentence within a concluding section that follows from and supports the information or explanation presented. The sentence also helps students address L.8.1a and L.8.5b by presenting an opportunity to explain the function of a gerund phrase and to use the relationships between words and phrases in the sentence to better understand the meaning and function of words and phrases.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses a gerund phrase (**making literature memorable**) with the purpose of defining a noun (**way**) to specify intention.

- Transfer: **way** + **of** + gerund phrase to express purpose in the Model Literary Analysis Essay: Relationship of Structure to Meaning essay and while answering selected and constructed response questions during the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **The intentional use of structure for message is <u>an important way of making literature memorable for readers</u>!**

- Ask:

“What is this sentence about?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **an important way of making literature memorable for readers!**

- Ask:

“Can you figure out which words in this chunk form a gerund phrase?” (Making literature memorable.)

“Can you figure out what the relationship is between this gerund phrase and the noun phrase an important way?” (The gerund phrase is defining and specifying an important way.)

“What word in the sentence is used to help express this relationship?” (Of.)

“What does this word tell us about the function of this gerund phrase? What makes you think so?” (The gerund phrase is functioning as a noun.)

“What if the writer used an infinitive rather than a gerund in this chunk?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses. Consider pointing out to students that while the meaning would be nearly the same if the writer used an infinitive instead of a gerund, the use of a gerund conveys that this in an ongoing, continuous process rather than an action that has an endpoint. The sentence would also not include the preposition of.)

- As needed, strategically use combinations of Conversation Cues to help students thoughtfully analyze the structure and function of this chunk:

- I’ll give you time to think and write or sketch. (Goal 1)

- Who can add on to what your classmate said? (Goal 4)

- How does our discussion add to your understanding of gerund and infinitive phrases? (Goal 3)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **The intentional use of structure for message is  
  <u>an important way of making literature memorable for readers!</u>**

- Ask:

“What’s another way to say this sentence?” (Responses will vary but should accurately capture the meaning of this chunk in a paraphrase similar to the following: writers use structure on purpose to convey something important in order to make their writing stand out as special to the people who read it.)

“How does this sentence follow from and support the information presented in the model essay?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses. Consider revisiting the focus statement of the essay to help students notice a connection between this sentence and the writer’s main claim.)

“How can we use the way + of + gerund phrase in our own speaking or writing?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses. Help students to understand that gerund and infinitive phrases can be used after the noun way to explain the purpose of an action.)

- Ask:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the concluding paragraph of the model essay?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

> **The use of citations in an essay is an important way of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

gerund phrase

> (gerund phrase + \[object\] + \[object\])

- Say:

“Use the frame to use to talk about using citations in an essay in your own words with your partners.”

- Possible student answers:
