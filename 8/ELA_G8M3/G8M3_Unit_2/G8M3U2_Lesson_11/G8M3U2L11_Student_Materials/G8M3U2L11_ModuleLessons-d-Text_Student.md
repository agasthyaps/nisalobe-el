Excerpt 2 from *The Other Victims* pages 67–71

I never saw anything wrong with being deaf. My younger sister, Theresa, and most of my friends were deaf. Though my parents were hard of hearing, my younger brother, Theo, had normal hearing. My father was one of six brothers. Four of them were hearing. When they came to visit, every hand was busy sharing news of the deaf community or giving advice. Our eyes were glued to the hands and faces of the signers. Everyone had so much to say.

In deaf school, the teachers got mad if I signed. They wanted me to read lips and to use my voice. I got so tired of watching the teacher’s lips. I couldn’t look away for a minute. It was even harder when she tried to teach me to say the letters correctly. The teacher put a strip of paper in front of my lips. “To make the *B* sound, purse your lips and blow just enough to make the paper quiver. To make a *P*, blow a little harder and make the paper shake.” Day after day, the teacher drilled me.

I felt like a bellows. I liked it better after school when the teachers weren’t around. My friends and I would make signs and chat with our fingers.

When I was fourteen, Hitler took over Germany. Theo, my eleven-year-old hearing brother, liked to go to the Munich Stadium to the rallies. Once Theo came home all excited because he had shaken Hitler’s hand. My favorite uncle, Karl, who could hear, got mad.

He shouted at my brother and signed at the same time. “Hitler is a disgrace to Germany. Don’t waste your time and hearing listening to him.”

My father put his fingers on my brother’s lips. “Don’t ever repeat what you have just heard. Swear by the Holy Father!”

Theo looked scared. “But in school, they tell us to report anything bad people say about Hitler.”

“If you don’t repeat it, no one will know your uncle said it.”

I couldn’t hear the radio so I never got excited about Hitler. The year 1933 was hard for me. I had just begun my apprenticeship at the convent. The sisters were teaching me how to sew, and I found it hard to understand them. On Saturdays I enjoyed going to a special Catholic club for deaf girls. Later, Hitler turned it into a branch of *Bund Deutscher Madel*, the Nazi club for girls. We were hiking, and once we went on a camping trip to Koenigsburg. That was enjoyable.

The rest of Hitler was horrible. For me, the trouble started in 1935. I came home from the convent and found Mother crying. “What’s the matter?” I signed.

She handed me the letter that read, “Frau Schwarz and her daughter Franziska are to come to the health office to arrange for their sterilization. Heil Hitler.” I couldn’t make out the signature at the bottom.

The whole family got upset. Uncle Karl started to sputter, as he always did when he was excited. “We’ll protest. The Nazis can’t do this to Franziska. She’s perfectly healthy. I’ll appeal to the administrative court ask them to overturn the order.”

The day of the hearing, my mother, my father, and all my uncles accompanied me to court. “She’s only sixteen years.” Uncle Karl talked and signed at the same time so I could understand. “Deafness is not always inherited. I’m her uncle, and I can hear perfectly well. As for her mother, she is going through menopause. Though she is a good Catholic, she promises not to have any more children.”

The two men on the judges’ bench whispered to each other. They frowned and shook their heads. After a few minutes, the one with the big nose and bald head stood up. “Petition denied for the minor, Franziska Schwarz. Since the mother promises not to have any more children, she will not have to be sterilized.”

I started to cry. The previous year, I had met a boy I liked, Christian Mikus. As a child, he had scarlet fever and lost his hearing in one ear. Christian and I liked to walk in the park. We’d sign for hours. Whenever he saw children playing, he’d smile and sign, “One day we will have children, too.” Of course we couldn’t get married then. He didn’t make much money working in a clothing factory. Whatever deaf people made, it was always less than other people. We used to get angry. We’d do just as good work as others, but the employers would always give us less. If I were sterilized, I didn’t think Christian would want to go with me anymore.

When my uncle walked out of the courtroom, his face was almost purple. “Franziska, Germany is no place for either of us. We’ll run away to Switzerland. I won’t let them sterilize you.”

Before we could run off, he was arrested by the Gestapo. He had shouted at his secretary, “Turn off the radio whenever Hitler talks. It’s not healthy to listen to a madman.” The secretary’s father was a stormtrooper. She reported Uncle Karl to the Gestapo. The Gestapo sentenced him to death for “spreading slander.”

I don’t know how, but his brother got him released. “For God’s sake. Keep your opinions to yourself. Hitler can’t last,” my father said. “Why take chances?”

At the same time my uncle was in prison, a letter came from the department of health. “Franziska Schwarz is to report to the Women’s Hospital in Munich for the sterilization.”

“I won’t go,” I cried. “I want to be able to have babies.”

Father looked sad. “If you don’t go, the police will drag you to the hospital.”

I screamed all the way to the hospital. The nurse locked me in a room with two other deaf teenagers. The three of us cried all night. When the nurse came to give us tranquilizers, I tried to fight her off. She held me down and gave me the injection. In the morning, I woke up in a room full of beds. My stomach hurt. I touched the bandages and started to cry. The nurse who brought me water was crying, too. “I’m sorry, there’s nothing I could do to help you. With Hitler, you have to be quiet.” Her fingers pointed to the portrait of Hitler hanging over the bed. She tapped her temple with her finger, to indicate, “He’s crazy.”

I had so much pain, I couldn’t go to the convent. I asked the public health insurance office for the standard sick pay.

“Why should you get sick pay?” the social worker sneered. “You can have all the fun you want. You don’t have to worry about getting pregnant.”

When Christian came to the house, I started to cry. “The doctors sterilized me. I guess you won’t want to be my boyfriend anymore.”

Christian made the sign for love. “Whatever happens, we’ll be together. As soon as you’re twenty-one, we’ll get married.”
