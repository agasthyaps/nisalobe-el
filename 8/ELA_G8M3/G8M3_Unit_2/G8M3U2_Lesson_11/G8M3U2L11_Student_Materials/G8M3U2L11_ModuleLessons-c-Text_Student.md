I cried when the prison barber clipped my hair and threw the locks into my lap. “A souvenir, Gypsy.” At sixteen, I was very vain. My black wavy hair had reached the nape of my neck. How could the Germans do this to me, Bubili, an Austrian Sinti? The barber put his hand on my shoulder to keep me from rising. “I’m not finished.” With a dull razor, he shaved the rest of my head, my chest, my whole body. When he finished, my whole body ached. I stared at those standing next to me. My father, my uncles, and my cousins were unrecognizable, plucked birds from some strange planet.

And I? Without my hair, I was no longer Bubili. I was a piece of wood.

No, worse. Even a piece of wood could be used for something. We were trash, something to be thrown away. Why did the Germans have to strip us of our humanity?

The commandant and the S.S. men came into the room. They poked us as though we were cattle. “These Gypsy men are strong. Not like the Jews and the others who come here half starved. Why not send them to the army? Let them learn to fight for us.”

“Orders are orders,” the commandant said. “Treat them like the rest of the scum.”

How did I arrive in Dachau concentration camp? I had never heard of the place.

When Hitler marched into Austria in March 1938, he first entered Linz and Vienna. I couldn’t read. I wasn’t aware of what the Nazis were doing in those cities. I lived in Klagenfurt, in southern Austria. For a few days, nothing happened.

One night, I went to the movies. Before I entered the theater at seven o’clock, I heard people shouting, “Heil Schuschnigg.” Schuschnigg was prime minister of Austria before the invasion. At nine o’clock, when I came out, people were yelling “Heil Hitler.”

I stopped a man on the street. “What kind of cattle call is ‘Heil Hitler’?”

“Be quiet,” the man whispered. “The Germans have just entered Klagenfurt. You’d better go home as fast as you can. Stick to the side streets. Don’t let them see you.”

My father was relieved when I walked into our house. “Bubili, I don’t want you going into the center of town. We have to learn what the Germans have in mind for our people,” he said. My father could read. He knew about Hitler’s threats.

I was fifteen. I couldn’t understand what was going on. When one of my uncles was taken to the hospital, I set out to bring him some food. As I walked toward the *Lindwurm-platz*, I noticed men in long leather coats talking to the police. I didn’t know a Gestapo from a giraffe. An Austrian policeman grabbed me by the arm. “Hey, dark one, where are your papers?”

“My father has them. Come with me to my house.”

Instead, he threw me in jail.

“Why are you locking me up? I haven’t done anything.”

“The Germans are the authority here. I don’t know why they want you. Perhaps they’ll send you to Germany, to a concentration camp.” The policeman slammed and locked the cell door.

I looked at the other prisoner. “Tell me, please, what does ‘concentration camp’ mean? The policeman thinks the Germans want to send me there.”

The prisoner looked frightened. He shrank into the corner, as though I was poison. “It’s a death camp.”

“Death camp? I have to escape.” I looked around. The only opening was a narrow window with bars. It overlooked the exercise yard.

“It’s impossible,” the other man said. “No one can escape from this cell. You’re a dead man.”

“No, I am Bubili.”

The cell door opened, and the guard shoved in a drunk. “I know, I know, there are only two cots, but he’ll be gone by tomorrow.”

The drunk collapsed on the floor and started to snore. I searched his pocket for cigarettes and found a knife. As he slept, I moved the knife back and forth across the radiator to make sharp teeth like a saw.

In the morning, the guard removed the drunk. I poked around the mortar surrounding the window. “There’s wood here,” I whispered to my cellmate. “Lie down with your ear to the floor. Listen if you hear the guard coming.”

The guards went around in felt slippers. You could only hear them if you kept your ear to the floor.

I worked like crazy, moving the knife back and forth until I made a hole alongside the window. I sawed until it was big enough for my head to go through. I was slim and wiry. Late that night, the other prisoner follow me through the hole onto the tin roof. It was raining, and the sound of the rain on the roof dulled all other noises. I hung from the roof by my hands and dropped to the ground. The other man followed. I led him through the back alleys to the woods. For several days we walked until we came to the Yugoslavian border.

\*\*\*

For months I lived on the run in Yugoslavia, in and out of prison. Eventually I decided Yugoslavia was too hot for me, and I went to Hungary.

\*\*\*

It was 1939. I had been away from home for more than a year. I “borrowed” a bicycle and arrived in Graz, Austria, around midnight. At the *Gasthaus Hasenwirt*, I went to the owner. We had always stopped at this inn to take care of the horses. “Where is my family?”

“Bubili, I don’t know. The Germans have locked up many Sinti. But I think there are still some at Bruck an der Mur. Your father may be among them.”

Bruck an der Mur was in the Austrian Alps, a good thirty-five miles away. I left immediately, using the darkness to make my way through the streets into the forest. I dared not be seen. A day later, I reached our circle of wagons high in the mountains. My uncle was astonished to see me. “Bubili, we thought you were dead.”

My father, my grandmother, my uncles, and my aunts crowded around to hug me.

After my grandmother had fed me some strew from the kettle, I lay down to rest. “Tomorrow,” my father said, “go to your mother’s brother in Leoben. I think you will be safer there.” My mother had died two years earlier.

The next morning I hiked through the mountains to Leoben, beside the river. My mother’s family welcomed me. That night, my uncle and I went to a tavern. As the tavern owners shook my uncle’s hand to welcome him, he whispered, “Blauch, take off. A drunken policeman boasted of a Gypsy roundup tomorrow. You’ll all be sent to a concentration camp.”

“The Germans can’t do anything to us. We are Austrian citizens,” my uncle assured me, “but, Bubili, let’s get back to the wagons.” The gaily painted wagons were grouped around the foot of a hill. At the top of the hill, there was a shed. Instead of sleeping on the ground next to my uncle’s wagon, I took some quilts and went to sleep in the shed.

The next morning, June 26, 1939 (I can never forget the date), S.S. and Austrian police surrounded the wagons at daybreak. My aunt tried to signal me to leave. She sang as loudly as she could in our Romani language. “Bubili, run.” But when one is young, one sleeps so well. When I did not wake up, she sang louder, “Run, run, the police are here. The Deathheads have come.”

I grabbed my pants and started to jump out the door. A waiting S.S. man seized me. “You,” he said, pushing me down the hill, “join the others.”

\*\*\*

The next day, the Germans forced all the men to climb into buses and trucks. I was the only young boy among 1,035 men. The women and children were released to go home.

\*\*\*

Two days later, June 28, the train stopped just outside the gates of Dachau. We waited, locked in the airless boxcar for about three quarters of an hour. Then, we heard a shout as thirty or forty young S.S. men unlocked the bolts and threw open the doors. “Austrian pigheads,” they screamed. “Out, out.”

\*\*\*

“Line up. Faces to the sun.” The whole square was filled with prisoners in striped uniforms. Many of them wore yellow stars on their shirts. The other had different colored triangles on their uniforms.

We stood on the assembly place, the sun beating down on us from early morning until three in the afternoon. If someone dropped, we were not allowed to pick him up. Then an S.S. man with a whip drove us into a building.

\*\*\*

Inside Dachau, the prisoners were a mixed lot. The triangle on his uniform marked each man. Gypsies had brown triangles; political prisoners, red. The greens were the most feared. They were criminals who had been sent to Dachau. Often they were the block elders or worked in the administration. Jehovah’s Witnesses wore purple triangles; homosexuals, pink. The Jews had two yellow triangles arranged into a Jewish star.

In September 1939, Germany invaded Poland and World War II began. Many of us were shipped to Buchenwald. Little did I know that I would consider Dachau heaven compared to Buchenwald. In Buchenwald, everything had to be done on the run. “*Schnell, schnell* (faster, faster),” the guards shouted as we struggled to haul trees or dig trenches. Blows fell on our backs and necks. One of my uncles could not move quickly enough. An S.S. man bludgeoned him to death.

Every night I fell asleep with pain in my heart. I kept saying to myself, “I am Bubili. I will outlive these bastards. I will one day give testimony.” I prayed for the luck that would help me stay alive.

One morning, as we stood at roll call, shivering in the snow, the S.S. man shouted, “Everyone count out loud from one to seven. Every seventh man step forward.” My father was lined up next to my mother’s youngest brother. I was near the end of the line.

I began to sweat. Out of the corner of my eye, I tried to figure out whether my father and uncle were safe. I heard my father shout “Five.” I breathed a sigh of relief. The counting grew closer. “Three,” the man next to me called. “Thank God.” I had survived the selections for death this time.

In December 1941 all Austrian Gypsies were shipped to Gusen 1, a labor camp in Austria. There, I was put in a separate barracks from my father and uncle. By luck, I had a good *kapo*. But I was concerned about my father. Though he was a powerful man, much taller than I, he had been weakened by lack of food. One day, when I returned from a work detail, I went looking for him. Five times I walked past him as he stood in front of his barracks, but I didn’t recognize him. he had shrunken to half his size. I finally recognized him by his big nose. I was shocked when I realized his physical condition. I lifted him in my arms. He was as light as a child.

A week later, the *kapo* assigned me to work in Gross-Rosen, another labor camp. When I saw the Germans were loading my father and one of my uncles onto a truck, I held back, saying, “I want to go with them.”

“No, Bubili,” the *kapo* snapped. “You go where I tell you.”

When I came back that evening, I couldn’t find my father. I ran to his barracks. He wasn’t there. I ran through the grounds like a madman shouting, “Father, father, where are you?”

My block elder grabbed me. “It’s too late, they were gassed on the truck. Calm down, otherwise you’re finished.”

For several days, I couldn’t eat. The block elder talked to me. “If you don’t eat, you’ll be ‘on the road to eternity.’ Your father and uncle are gone. You have to do everything you can to stay alive.”

Yes, I had to live to bear witness to this senseless machinery of human destruction. Again, I was lucky. The *kapo* helped me get a job cooking for the S.S. They liked the stews that I had learned to make over campfires. At last, I had enough to eat. I smuggled out food to the Sinti.

The days and years run together.

\*\*\*

Towards the end of the war, I was sent to Gusen 2, another labor camp. I was surprised to find Jewish children in the camp. I thought they had all been killed, but here were sixteen children from eleven to sixteen years old. These children were marked for death. Hitler wanted no one alive to bear witness.

I thought of my brother and my sisters, my nieces and my nephews, and wept. Somehow we had to save these few surviving children. Where they came from, where their parents were, nobody knew. By this time, there was no longer tight supervision in the camps. The younger, highly disciplined S.S. men had fled. Older, less murderous men now held command.

I went to my barracks elder, Juckel. “Juckel, how can we let the Germans murder these children? The war is almost over. They don’t have to die.”

“But their numbers have already been assigned for the transport to the crematorium. There’s no way I can save them. Their numbers are down.”

I shook my head. “No, Juckel, there are old people here who won’t make it to next week. Trade their numbers for the children’s numbers. You can hide the children until the Allies arrive. The new guards don’t check like the others did.”

He folded and refolded his blanket. “Where would we hide them? It’s impossible.”

“You’re a good man, not like the others. It will be on your conscience,” I said, turning toward the door. “Maybe you should talk it over with your friend, the camp elder, in the administration building. Records can be altered.”

I went outside and began to play with the children.

Juckel left the barracks. A short while later he touched my arm, “Switch the numbers. If we’re caught . . .”

Was I any better than the Nazis deciding who should live and who should die? These were older people, skeletons, barely able to walk. People without hope, *musselmen* (zombies). Who had the greater right to live? The children or the *musselmen*? I thought of my sisters and brother.

“Don’t say anything,” I told the children when I changed their numbers. “Just memorize your new number.”

Juckel and the camp elder led the children away. Where they hid them, I don’t know.

The fighting grew closer. More and more the guards disappeared. When the Americans marched into the camp, I was hysterical with joy. I had survived. More than that, I had helped to save sixteen children.
