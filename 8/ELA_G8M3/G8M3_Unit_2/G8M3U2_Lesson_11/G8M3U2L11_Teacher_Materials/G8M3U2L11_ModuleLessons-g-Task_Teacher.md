In Excerpt 1 of *The Other Victims* by Ina Friedman, Bubili is captured multiple times by the Nazis but manages to survive and to help save sixteen children from the gas chambers. Bubili is first arrested in Austria when he does not have his papers. He escapes prison and is on the run for years. He returns home to see family but is captured again and brought to a concentration camp. He survives multiple concentration camps. He helps hide sixteen children from the gas chambers by switching their identifying numbers with those of elderly prisoners. He survives to see liberation, as do the sixteen children. In his memoir, Bubili says, “I had to live to bear witness to this senseless machinery of human destruction” (21). This develops the theme that there is an immeasurable human will to survive and persevere through oppression.

In Excerpt 2 of *The Other Victims* by Ina Friedman, Franziska is sterilized by the Nazis because she is deaf, but her partner continues to love her. Franziska and her mother are summoned to court because they are deaf. After going to court, Franziska’s mother is allowed to remain unsterilized because she promises not to have more children, but Franziska is forced into sterilization. Franziska is worried that her boyfriend, who wants children, will not want to be with her. Yet he continues to love her. When Franziska tells her boyfriend what happened, he makes “the sign for love. ‘Whatever happens, we’ll be together. As soon as you’re twenty-one, we’ll get married’” (71). This develops the theme that true love can withstand great cruelty.
