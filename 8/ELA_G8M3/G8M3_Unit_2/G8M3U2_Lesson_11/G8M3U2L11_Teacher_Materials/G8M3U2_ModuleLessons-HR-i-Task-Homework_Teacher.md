Homework: Verb Mood: Objective Summary: *Night*

(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Read the summary below and answer the question that follows about verb mood.

In *Night* by Elie Wiesel, Elie faces death in a concentration camp. Elie stands in a line with his father, mother, and sister. They are separated into gender groups by the German soldiers.  
Elie only has his father to help him through this. Other inmates give them advice. It is essential that they lie about their ages so they can be used as workers instead of being burned alive. However, the soldiers start to lead Elie’s group toward the fiery pit. Men begin to pray and Elie’s father weeps, but Elie is angry at God for allowing people to die this way. He contemplates running into the barbed wire to die quickly, rather than let the Nazis burn him alive. If he takes his own life, he might suffer less and will feel less pain. In the memoir  
excerpt Elie says, “I gathered all that remained of my strength in order to break rank and throw myself onto the barbed wire. Deep down, I was saying good-bye to my father, to the whole universe . . .” (33–34). As Elie and his father are almost at the pit of flames and Elie prepares to head to the barbed wire, his group is directed past the flames to barracks, and are not killed by the soldiers. Does this develop the theme that trauma can cause one to lose all religious faith and hope?
