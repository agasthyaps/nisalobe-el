In *Night* by Elie Wiesel, Elie details being locked in a train car by the German army during the Holocaust. Elie and the other Jewish prisoners are hungry, thirsty and cramped on a train to Kaschau. German soldiers count every Jewish prisoner on the train. They threaten to shoot and kill them if they try to escape. They also force them to surrender their gold, silver, and watches to the soldiers or they will be killed. Elie notes his experience on the train is the same as the way animals are transported. In the memoir excerpt Elie says, “The doors were nailed, the way back irrevocably cut off. The world had become a hermetically sealed cattle car” (24). This develops the theme that cruelty and total control by others can make people feel like helpless victims.
