In *Night* by Elie Wiesel, Elie is locked in a train car by the German army during the Holocaust. They have to stay inside the train. Elie and the other Jewish prisoners are hungry, thirsty, and cramped on a train to Kaschau. German soldiers count every Jewish prisoner on the train. If the prisoners try to escape, the soldiers shoot and kill them. If they can find space, the prisoners might sit and will look out the window.
