**Excerpt from *Night* by Elie Wiesel, pages 29–34**

The beloved objects that we had carried with us from place to place were now left behind in the wagon and, with them, finally, our illusions.

Every few yards, there stood an SS man, his machine gun trained on us. Hand in hand we followed the throng.

An SS came towards us, wielding a club. He commanded:

“Men to the left! Women to the right!”

Eight words spoken so quietly, indifferently, without emotion. Eight simple, short words. Yet that was the moment when I left my mother. There was no time to think, and I already felt my father’s hand press against mine: we were alone. In a fraction of a second I could see my mother, my sister, move to the right. Tzipora was holding Mother’s hand. I saw them walking farther and farther away; Mother was stroking my sister’s blond hair, as if to protect her. And I walked on with my father, with the men. I didn’t know that this was the moment in time and the place where I was leaving my mother and Tzipora forever. I kept walking, my father holding my hand.

Behind me, an old man fell to the ground. Nearby, an SS man replaced his revolver in its holster.

My hand tightened its grip on my father. All I could think of was not to lose him. Not to remain alone.

The SS officers gave the order.

“Form ranks of fives!”

There was a tumult. It was imperative to stay together.

“Hey, kid, how old are you?”

The man interrogating me was an inmate. I could not see his face, but his voice was weary and warm.

“Fifteen.”

“No. You’re eighteen.”

“But I’m not,” I said. “I’m fifteen.”

“Fool. Listen to what *I* say.”

Then he asked my father, who answered:

“I’m fifty.”

“No.” The man now sounded angry. “Not fifty. You’re forty. Do you hear? Eighteen and forty.”

He disappeared into the darkness. Another inmate appeared, unleashing a stream if invectives:

“Didn’t you know what was in store for you here in Auschwitz? You didn’t know? In 1944?”

True. We didn’t know. Nobody had told us. He couldn’t believe his ears. His tone became even harsher:

“Over there. Do you see the chimney over there? Do you see it? And the flames, do you see them?” (Yes, we saw the flames.) “Over there, that’s where they will take you. Over there will be your grave. You still don’t understand?. . . Don’t you understand anything? You will be burned! Burned to a cinder! Turned into ashes!”

His anger changed into fury. We stood stunned, petrified. Could this be just a nightmare? An unimaginable nightmare?

I heard whispers around me:

“We must do something. We can’t let them kill us like that, like cattle in a slaughterhouse. We must revolt.”

There were, among us, a few tough young men. They actually had knives and were urging us to attack the armed guards. One of them was muttering:

“Let the world learn about the existence of Auschwitz. Let everybody find out about it while they still have a chance to escape . . .”

But the older men begged their sons not to be foolish:

“We mustn’t give up hope, even now as the sword hangs over our heads. So taught our  
sages . . .”

The wind of revolt died down. We continued to walk until we came to a crossroads. Standing in the middle of it was, though I didn’t know it then, Dr. Mengele, the notorious Dr. Mengele. He looked like the typical SS officer: a cruel, though not unintelligent, face, complete with monocle. He was holding a conductor’s baton and was surrounded by officers. The baton was moving constantly, sometimes to the right, sometimes to the left.

In no time, I stood before him.

“Your age?” he asked, perhaps trying to sound paternal.

“I’m eighteen.” My voice was trembling.

“In good health?”

“Yes.”

“Your profession?”

Tell him that I was a student?

“Farmer,” I heard myself saying.

This conversation lasted no more than a few seconds. It seemed like an eternity.

The baton pointed to the left. I took a half step forward. I first wanted to see where they would send my father. Were he to have gone to the right, I would have run after him.

The baton, once more, moved to the left. A weight lifted from my heart.

We did not know, as yet, which was the better side, right or left, which road led to prison and which to the crematoria. Still, I was happy, I was near my father. Our procession continued slowly to move forward.

Another inmate came over to us:

“Satisfied?”

“Yes,” someone answered.

“Poor devils, you are heading to the crematorium.”

He seemed to be telling the truth.

So that was where we were going. . . .

I pinched myself: Was I still alive? Was I awake? How was it possible that men, women, and children were being burned and that the world kept silent? No. All this could not be real.  
A nightmare perhaps . . . Soon I would wake up with a start, my heart pounding, and find that  
I was back in the room of my childhood, with my books. . . .

My father’s voice tore me from my daydreams:

“What a shame, a shame that you did not go with your mother . . . I saw many children your age go with their mothers. . . .”

His voice was terrible sad. I understood that he did not wish to see what they would do to me. He did not wish to see his only son go up in flames.

My forehead was covered with cold sweat. Still, I told him that I could not believe that human beings were being burned in our times; the world would never tolerate such crimes . . .

“The world? The world is not interested in us. Today, everything is possible, even the crematoria . . .” His voice broke.

“Father,” I said. “If this is true, then I don’t want to wait. I’ll run into the electrified barbed wire. That would be easier than a slow death in the flames.”

He didn’t answer. He was weeping. His body was shaking. Everybody around us was weeping. Someone began to recite Kaddish, the prayer for the dead. I didn’t know whether, during the history of the Jewish people, men have ever before recited Kaddish for themselves.

“*Yisgadal, veyiskadash, shmey, raba* . . . May His name be celebrated and sanctified . . .” whispered my father.

For the first time, I felt anger rising within me. Why should I sanctify His name? The Almighty, the eternal and terrible Master of the Universe, chose to be silent. What was there to thank Him for?

We continued our march. We were coming closer and closer to the pit, from which an infernal heat was rising. Twenty more steps. If I was going to kill myself, this was the time. Our column had only fifteen steps to go. I bit my lips so that my father would not hear my teeth chattering. Ten more steps. Eight. Seven. We were walking slowly, as one follows a hearse, our own funeral procession. Only four more steps. Three. There it was now, very close to us, the pit and its flames. I gathered all that remained of my strength in order to break rank and throw myself onto the barbed wire. Deep down, I was saying good-bye to my father, to the whole universe, and, against my will, I found myself whispering the words: “*Yisgadal, veyiskadash, shmey,  
raba* . . . May His name be celebrated and sanctified. . . .” My heart was about to burst.  
There. I was face-to-face with the Angel of Death . . .

No. Two steps from the pit, we were ordered to turn left and herded into barracks.

I squeezed my father’s hand.

Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, that turned my life into one long night seven times sealed.

Never shall I forget that smoke.

Never shall I forget those flames that consumed my faith forever.

Never shall I forget the nocturnal silence that deprived me for all eternity of the desire to live.

Never shall I forget those moments that murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to ashes.

Never shall I forget those things, even were I condemned to lives as long as God Himself.

Never.
