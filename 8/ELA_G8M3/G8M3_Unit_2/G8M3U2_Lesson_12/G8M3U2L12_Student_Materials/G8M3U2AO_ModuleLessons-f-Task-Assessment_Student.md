End of Unit 2 Assessment: Language Assessment: Correct Verb Mood

**Name:** **Date:**

**Directions:** Imagine that a classmate of yours has recently read an excerpt from the memoir *The Boy on the Wooden Box* and has written a summary paragraph of that excerpt. Read the summary, and answer the questions that follow.

In the excerpt from *The Boy on the Wooden Box*, Leon Leyson tells his story of survival during the Holocaust. He explains how he and other Jewish people maintained their poise, hope, and sense of self despite the terrible conditions of life in a ghetto. Leyson describes the crowded, unsanitary, and devastating conditions in the ghetto. Because of these conditions, people would get sick and they will die. He also writes that some people were forced to take trains to new ghettos in the countryside. If Jewish people escaped these new ghettos, they returned to the city with awful stories. This made people afraid to get on these trains. Unfortunately, Leyson’s brother was forced onto a train. Leyson also describes how his neighbors, and others in the ghetto, worked hard to maintain normalcy. It was essential that they be active to maintain a sense of self-worth and dignity. They cooked together, cared for each other, and fell in love. Leyson says, “Despite everything against us, we remained determined to show respect and decency toward one another.” Subtle forms of resistance were used by these victims to fight the devastating treatment they experienced. “Retaining our humanity, cherishing our heritage, we fought the depravity of the Nazis with subtle forms of resistance.” This develops the theme that humans are resilient and able to find many ways to challenge oppression.

| **Indicative Mood**    | Expresses a fact, intention, desire, or belief. Most sentences are statements made using the indicative mood.                                                                                                                      |
| **Imperative Mood**    | Expresses commands or requests and indicates that the speaker desires for the action expressed in the sentence to take place. In imperative sentences, the subject is **you**, but it is not stated in the sentence.               |
| **Interrogative Mood** | Expresses a question.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Conditional Mood**   | Expresses possibility or uncertainty, based on something else happening first, through the use of words like **might**, **could**, and **would** before the base form of the verb.                                                 |
| **Subjunctive Mood**   | Expresses imaginary or possible outcomes, suggestion, demands, necessity, and wishes. The subjunctive is formed using the base form of a verb (e.g., **be**, **go**, **have**, **finish**) after the subject in a **that** clause. |
