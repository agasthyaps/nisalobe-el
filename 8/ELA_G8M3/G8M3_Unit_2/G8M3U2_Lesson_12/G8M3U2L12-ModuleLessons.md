Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Work Time A: Students complete their End of Unit 2 Assessment by answering questions about verb usage, form, and mood after reading an objective literary summary of *The Boy on the Wooden Box*. (L.8.1c, L.8.1d, L.8.3)

- RI.8.10 – Closing and Assessment A: Students share what they’ve learned about in their independent research reading texts to hold them accountable for their reading homework. Consider using Independent Reading Sample Plans located on the Tools Page (http://eled.org/tools) if not using another independent reading review routine.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners by reading and answering questions independently for the end of unit assessment. Students also focus on working to become an ethical person. The characteristic that students practice is integrity as they share and discuss the independent reading they have been doing regularly for homework.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Ask students to reflect on their growth or learning between the mid-unit assessment and the end of unit assessment. Also, ask students to create goals for the coming unit.

- If students find they have additional time after completing the assessment, they can write short rationales explaining why they responded to each assessment item as they did. For example, for the first question, students might explain how the subjunctive mood is formed and analyze each verb in the selected response options against this structure.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the second half of this unit, students read various texts about Holocaust survivors, determining main ideas and key details of excerpts, and writing objective summaries of what they read. Students also examined and used forms of verbs in different moods. This lesson continues those routines in an assessment.

Support All Students

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment.

- Some students may need the summary paragraph read aloud before they work on the questions. Consider inviting students who require this to sit in a group away from the rest of the students, so as not to be distracting.

- For some students, this assessment may require more than the 20 minutes allotted. Provide time over multiple days if necessary.

- To support ELLs, this lesson has an assessment with questions that are closely aligned to the tasks students have been carrying out throughout the second half of the unit to apply their knowledge of verb mood. Students answer selected and constructed response questions on the form and usage of verb moods. The questions on the assessment are very similar in format to the practice questions students have worked with in Lessons 8, 9, 10, and 11.

- ELLs may find it challenging to answer the questions on the assessment without being able to reference their Verb Mood organizer or other grammar resources they have been relying on to complete the language work carried out in previous lessons. Remind students that they have been practicing for this assessment by completing questions that are quite similar to the ones they will encounter. Suggest to students that they use the underlined verbs in the sentences in each question to help guide their thinking.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.C.11 and 8.I.C.12.

Assessment Guidance

- All assessment Materials (student copy, answer key, and teacher checklist) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will create a commemorative poster, honoring a voice of the Holocaust, to be used in the silent Commemorative Poster Share in Lesson 14. Students select a summary paragraph from those created in Lessons 8–11, and locate corresponding visuals to highlight the theme of the summary.

- Students’ Module 3 End of Unit 2 Assessments will be returned in Unit 3 Lesson 5 with feedback.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare

- Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 12

- End of Unit 2 Assessment: Language Assessment: Correct Verb Mood (see Assessment Overview and Resources)

- Ensure there is a copy of Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 12, along with students’ Mid-Unit 2 Assessments with feedback, at each student’s workspace.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous modules to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- As students enter the classroom, invite them to complete **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 12**, using their **Mid-Unit 2 Assessments with feedback** on their desks.

- Circulate as students review their feedback, and offer guidance and support as necessary.

- Once all students are ready, invite them to share their stars and steps with a partner. Remind students that everyone is working toward individual goals and that learning is about continued growth and development.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. End of Unit 2 Assessment: Language Assessment: Correct Verb Mood (20 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can use verbs in different moods and voices.”

- Distribute **End of Unit 2 Assessment: Language Assessment: Correct Verb Mood**.

- Tell students that for this assessment, they will read a new summary paragraph of the text *The Boy on the Wooden Box* that is similar in content and form to the objective summaries they created in Lessons 8–11 and then answer questions about language usage in that summary.

- Read the directions for each part of the assessment aloud as students follow along, reading silently. Answer clarifying questions.

- Direct students’ attention to the following anchor charts:

- **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart**

- **Strategies to Answer Selected Response Questions anchor chart**

- Remind students to refer to these anchor charts as they read the assessment text and answer the assessment questions.

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence. Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart** and review what perseverance looks and sounds like. Remind students that because they will be reading and answering questions independently for the assessment, they may need to practice perseverance.

- Invite students to begin the assessment.

- While they are taking the assessment, circulate to monitor and document their test-taking skills.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- Before the assessment of Work Time A, underline key vocabulary in the assessment directions and prompt and read aloud together as a class to ensure that students understand each task included in the assessment. Invite students who need lighter support to restate or clarify information for students who need heavier support.

For Heavier Support

- Before the assessment, give students 2 minutes to talk through the five English moods and their purposes with a partner (*indicative*, *imperative*, *interrogative*, *conditional*, *subjunctive*). Encourage students to refer back to their Verb Mood organizers for definition and examples.

Closing and Assessment

A. Share Independent Research Reading – RI.8.10 (20 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to guide students to share their independent research reading, reminding students that the purpose of research reading is to build their content knowledge, domain-specific vocabulary, and achievement on reading complex texts. As necessary, use the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart** to review integrity.

- Refer to the **Independent Reading Sample Plans** to guide students through a research reading share or use a different routine.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- Use a Conversation Cue to prompt students to paraphrase what their partner said during the Independent Research Reading share (e.g., “Who can repeat what your classmate said?” “Who can tell us what your classmate said in your own words?”). This will help students to practice restating ideas in their own words, and hearing others relay what they have shared will promote thoughtful consideration of the goals students have set around collaboration.

For Heavier Support

- As in Unit 1, invite students to draw graphic panels that represent an event or incident in their research reading text. This will help students to deepen their understanding of the text they have read and serve as continued practice with graphic panel creation, which connects to the final performance task in the module.

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
