Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RL.8.2 – Work Time A: Students analyze a Commemorative Poster model, determining how each aspect of the model aligns to the work they have done in summarizing the experience of a victim or survivor of the Holocaust.

- W.8.4 – Work Time A: Students revise their selected summary to ensure that the writing is appropriate to the purpose and audience for their poster.

- W.8.6 – Work Time B: Students use technology to locate images that connect to the themes and voices portrayed in their selected objective summary and to show the relationship between the themes and voices presented.

- RL.8.2 – Closing and Assessment A: Students create their own Commemorative Poster by locating and revising an objective summary of a Holocaust voice, identifying a critical theme from this voice, and finding associated images that connect to details and themes of Holocaust voice presented.

- Lessons 13 and 14 present an opportunity for students to respectfully honor the many stories and voices students have read about the Holocaust. The tone of these lessons is a respectful honoring of the learning they have done on this sensitive and important historical event. In this lesson, students will focus on becoming ethical people by respectfully discussing the voices and themes of the Holocaust presented thus far in the module.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Provide time for students to honor more than one voice of the Holocaust by creating an additional commemorative poster.

- Allow students to draw an image that connects to their summary in Work Time B. Guide students to understand that further representing this voice in a drawing requires them to create images that are sensitive to the topic of the Holocaust and maintain the respectful tone of the task.

- Students can search for other examples of visual art that honors and commemorates voices of the Holocaust. Students can share these in small groups or with the class as a whole.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In Lessons 8–11, students read multiple pieces by and about victims and survivors of the Holocaust and wrote objective summary paragraphs that included theme statements. In this lesson, students will choose one voice from a summary they have written that resonates with them and choose visual elements to further convey this voice in a commemorative poster.

Support All Students

- Pair students (especially ELLs) thoughtfully for pair share to build supportive and safe exchange. Vary these partners throughout the unit to expose students to diverse perspectives one-on-one.

- Students might be intimidated by the idea of creating a poster that will be seen by an audience, redirect students to the purpose of the sharing in Lesson 13, and ensure them that their poster will be an important resource for other students, and it will display an important voice of the Holocaust.

- Consider providing more than one model poster to students. This will show students variation in the possibilities. In addition, prepare some visuals ahead of time for students to choose from, by reviewing, in advance, the themes and voices from Lesson 11, in particular, and Lessons 8–10 as well.

- As appropriate, create the template students use in Closing and Assessment A on chart paper, and allow students to create large versions of their Holocaust Commemorative Posters. Similarly, enlarge the template students use creating more work space for students to capture elements of their poster. Or, as supported by existing technology, create a digital version of the template for use with students.

- To support ELLs, this lesson gives students time to analyze a Model Commemorative Poster that honors a voice of a victim of the Holocaust before they create their own visual representation based on the summary they wrote in Lesson 12. The lesson also incorporates the Praise, Question, Suggestion protocol as a way of offering critique and feedback in preparation for revision of work. This process helps students see what is working and then ask questions and offer suggestions, leading to revision and improvement.

- ELLs may find it challenging to offer feedback that is beneficial to their peers. Modeling and sentence starters can be used to help prepare students through the Praise, Question, and Suggestion protocol so that the feedback exchanged can be as meaningful as possible.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.C.11 and 8.I.C.12.

Assessment Guidance

- Review student posters to make sure they meet the criteria determined in Work Time A, and ensure student work aligns to the respectful tone of the task.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will display their commemorative posters in a Commemorative Poster Share format and participate a silent viewing of the posters to honor the lives of these victims and survivors.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.8.4 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 13**.

- Prompt students to Turn and Talk about their answers to the entrance ticket. Cold-call students to share out. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 13 (example for teacher reference)**.

- Prompt students to add the word *commemorate* (to recall and show respect for someone or something, often marked by some ceremony or observation) to their **vocabulary logs** and add it to the **academic word wall**. Explain to students that today, they will explore a model commemorative poster that honors and shows respect for a voice of the Holocaust.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Analyze a Model Poster and Review Criteria – RL.8.2 (10 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can determine criteria for an effective commemorative poster honoring a voice of the Holocaust.”

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“Why is it important to pause and take time to commemorate voices of the Holocaust?” (Answers will vary, but may include by pausing and honoring voices, we reflect on what we have learned from these voices and think about the significance of the experiences.)

- Tell students that in this lesson, they will have the opportunity to choose a voice from the Holocaust victims and survivors they have read about and to honor that voice by creating a commemorative poster.

- Display the **Model Commemorative Poster**, and prompt students to review it silently for a minute.

- Prompt students to Turn and Talk:

“In what ways does this poster commemorate voices from the Holocaust?” (Answers will vary, but could mention that it presents a voice of the Holocaust by showing a summary and a significant theme and refers to why the theme is important to remember or discuss. By highlighting this voice of the Holocaust, the creator of the model is honoring his or her experiences.)

“How did the creator of the Model Commemorative Poster organize the material presented?” (Answers will vary, but students should recognize that there is a paragraph summarizing the experience, two visuals, a statement of theme, a significant, related quote from the text, and a section that reflects on the importance of this theme.)

- Then, allow partners to grapple with possible criteria for their posters by asking them the following question:

“If we were going to create a similar commemorative poster, what criteria should we pay attention to? Use what you see in the model to brainstorm possible criteria.” (Answers will vary)

- Narrow in on the summary shown in the model, and read it aloud as students follow along.

- Ask students:

“Where does this summary come from?” (Answers will vary, but students should recognize that this summary was based on one they created about the Holocaust voice read in Lesson 8.)

- Display and distribute the **Holocaust Commemorative Poster criteria**, and read the first criterion listed:

- “Summary from Lessons 8–11 is revised to highlight the experience and voice of the person they are commemorating.”

- Make sure students know that to meet this criterion, they will pick a summary they have already written and revise it to highlight the experience and voice of the person they are commemorating. Prompt students to read the summary of experience in the poster again, comparing it to their summary of **“** ***Abe’s Story***: **Excerpts and Synopsis”** from Lesson 8.

“How is the new summary slightly different from the one you wrote in Lesson 8?” (It doesn’t start with the title and author, and the quote and the theme have been taken out and put on another place on the poster.)

“How does reorganizing the parts of the summary make the poster more appropriate for this purpose and audience?” (Pulling out the quote and making it large highlights the voice of the victim or survivor. The summary tells the person’s story; it focuses on the Holocaust experience. Separating the theme and making it larger helps the viewer see what might be learned from this experience.)

- Explain to students that they should consider selecting voices from Lesson 11, and if they would rather choose a voice from Lessons 9 or 10, that is an option as well.

- Read the rest of the criteria listed aloud as students follow along. Read each criterion, and have students Turn and Talk with a partner about where they see that aspect in the model. Refer to the Holocaust Commemorative Poster criteria as needed.

- Narrow in on the criterion below:

- “Student reflects on the significance of the theme, and why it is important to remember this theme and experience, and includes a connection to habits of character.”

- Use a total participation technique and ask a student to read the “Importance of Remembering This Theme:” section of the model aloud. Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“Why is this section of the commemorative poster important?” (Answers will vary but may mention that connecting the themes they discussed in their objective summaries to habits of character allows them to think about greater universal experiences and themes, possibly connecting them to their own experiences.)

- Display the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart** and the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**, and ask students to brainstorm:

“What other habits of character might connect to the themes we’ve studied?” (Answers will vary, but may include respect as we read and thought about survivors who had difficult choices to make or compassion as we read and thought about people who experienced trauma and thought about the impact it had on their lives and religious beliefs.)

- Use a total participation technique to select answers from the group. Field any questions students have about all of the criteria and address any misconceptions as group teaching points.

- Prompt students to review their objective summaries from Lesson 11 and to choose the summary voice they wish to honor.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- Allow students to discuss the model poster and to carry out their own poster planning in home language groups in Work Times A and B. Given the sensitive nature of the topic and the importance of accurately honoring Holocaust victims’ voices, it is important that students have a clear and deep understanding of both the task and the content they will engage with and portray.

Work Time

B. Select Visual Representations of Theme and Summary – W.8.6 (10 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can use visuals and text effectively in a commemorative poster to highlight the themes and honor a voice of the Holocaust.”

- Direct students back to the visual elements of the model, and show how they provide more detail and insight, in a visual way, to their commemorative poster.

- Explain that they will now have time to search for images that enhance the theme in the Holocaust voice they chose to commemorate.

- Ask students to brainstorm the visuals they might include by asking them to Turn and Talk:

“What types of visuals would enhance the theme you are commemorating?” (Answers will vary, but may include maps of areas mentioned in my summary, historical photographs of events, images of artifacts or personal belongings, etc.)

- Direct students to gather their **computers** and explore authoritative online resources on this topic, such as the following:

- Link for images and general info: http://eled.org/0204

- Link for maps: http://eled.org/0205

- Circulate as students work, answering questions and prompting students to focus their search methods.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Closing and Assessment

A. Create a Commemorative Poster – RL.8.2 (20 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can use visuals and text effectively in a commemorative poster to highlight the themes and honor a voice of the Holocaust.”

- Display the Model Commemorative Poster, distribute the **Holocaust Commemorative Poster template**, and ask students to join with a partner.

- Direct students to review the Holocaust Commemorative Poster criteria list and orally rehearse with their partner how they will attend to each criterion in their own individual poster, using the model as a guide.

- Prompt students to begin creating their posters on the Holocaust Commemorative Poster template. Remind them to make slight changes in their summary in order to shift the focus from a text summary to highlighting the victim or survivor’s experience. Remind them to organize the materials collected in Work Times A and B on their Holocaust Commemorative Poster template and keep the criteria in mind as they complete each aspect of the poster.

- As students work, circulate and ask questions to promote student success with the task:

“Why is it important to highlight this particular theme or experience?” (Answers will vary.)

“What habits of character connect to the theme you are displaying?” (Answers will vary.)

“Which quote will you pull out of the text to deepen the viewer’s understanding of the Holocaust voice you are commemorating?” (Answers will vary.)

- If time allows, prompt students to join a partner and review each indicator on the Holocaust Commemorative Poster criteria list, pointing to the associated aspect on their poster, sharing how it meets the criteria, and noting how they attended to the criteria on their criteria list. Students note any areas for revision on their criteria list.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.
