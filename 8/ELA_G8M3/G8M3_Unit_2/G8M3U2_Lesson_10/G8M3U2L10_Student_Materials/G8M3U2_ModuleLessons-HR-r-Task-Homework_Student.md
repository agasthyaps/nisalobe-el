Homework: Verb Mood: Objective Summary

**Name:** **Date:**

**Directions:** Reread the summary and answer the question that follows about verb mood.

**Note:** Anne Frank was a young Jewish Holocaust victim who journaled her experiences hiding during the war. These journals became a very famous book: *The Diary of a Young Girl*.

In Anne Frank’s final diary entry in *The Diary of a Young Girl*, she writes about her conflicted personality. If Anne is around other people, she might be outgoing and will do boisterous things. She acknowledges that most people do not like her very much. Adults say she is disrespectful and think her opinions and outspokenness are inappropriate because she is a child. However, when she is alone, she is sensitive and vulnerable. Anne admits that she behaves one way in public, and another in private because she does not think people will respect her if she does not appear to be strong and confident. It is important that Anne be well-respected. Anne says “I’m afraid they’ll mock me, think I’m ridiculous and sentimental and not take me seriously” (335). Because people do not know the real Anne Frank, she believes she will be forgotten and no one will care about her. This develops the theme that people may hide their true feelings because they are afraid of being seen as vulnerable.
