In *Night* by Elie Wiesel, Elie faces death in a concentration camp. Elie stands in a line with his father, mother, and sister. The German soldiers separate them by gender. Elie only has his father to help him through this. Other inmates give them advice to lie about their ages so they can be used as workers instead of being burned alive. However, the soldiers start to lead Elie’s group toward the fiery pit. Men begin to pray and Elie’s father weeps. However, Elie is angry at God for allowing people to die this way. He contemplates running to the barbed wire to die quickly, rather than let the Nazis burn him alive. In the memoir excerpt Elie says, “I gathered all that remained of my strength in order to break rank and throw myself onto the barbed wire. Deep down, I was saying good-bye to my father, to the whole universe . . .” (33–34). As Elie and his father are almost at the pit of flames, Elie prepares to head to the barbed wire. But his group is directed past the flames to barracks, and are not killed by the soldiers. This develops the theme that trauma can cause one to lose all religious faith and hope.
