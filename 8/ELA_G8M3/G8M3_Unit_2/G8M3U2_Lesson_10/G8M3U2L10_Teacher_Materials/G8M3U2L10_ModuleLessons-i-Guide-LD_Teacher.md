5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide:  
Excerpt from *Night*, Pages 29–34

L.8.1c, L.8.3a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

I first wanted **to see where they would send my father**. (from excerpt from *Night*, pages 29–34 by Elie Wiesel)

**Lesson 10 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive during Closing and Assessment A of the lesson as directed in the Teacher’s Guide.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target (**I can use verbs in different moods to achieve particular effects**) and L.8.1c and L.8.3a by providing an opportunity to consider how verbs are formed and used in the conditional mood to express possibility and uncertainty about outcome.

- Supporting standards: L.8.1a

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it contains a noun clause within an infinitive phrase expressed in the conditional mood.

- Transfer: **would** + verb = to recall a writer’s uncertainty about outcome when writing summaries of memoirs and on the End of Unit 3 assessment when answering questions about verb mood.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **I first wanted <u>to see where they would send my father</u>**.

- Ask:

“What is this sentence about?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **to see where they would send my father**.

- Ask:

“Can you figure out which mood the verb inside of this phrase is expressed in? How do you know?” (The word would tells us this verb is expressed in the conditional mood.)

- Note: While the focus of this Dive is not on infinitive phrases, consider reinforcing students’ work with verbals earlier in the module by pointing out that this is an infinitive phrase and that the object within this infinitive phrase is a noun clause.

“Why does Elie Wiesel use the conditional mood within this infinitive phrase to talk about his father being sent away?” (Because it had not yet happened. Elie Wiesel is using the conditional mood to express possibility and uncertainty.)

- As needed, strategically use combinations of Conversation Cues to help students thoughtfully analyze the structure and function of this chunk:

“I’ll give you time to think and write.” (Goal 1)

“Who can add on to what your classmate said?” (Goal 4)

“How does our discussion add to your understanding of the conditional mood?”  
(Goal 3)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **I first wanted <u>to see where they would send my father</u>**.

- Ask:

“You figured out that the mood of a verb within the infinitive phrase is expressed in the conditional mood, but what mood is the main verb of this sentence (wanted) expressed in? How do you know?” (Indicative. It is being used to state that something occurred, which is a fact.)

“Now what do you think this sentence means?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“How can we use the conditional mood in our own in our speaking or writing?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses, but consider pointing out to students that they can use the conditional mood to express possible outcomes and uncertainty when something has not yet occurred.)

- Ask:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the concluding paragraph of the excerpt?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

**Before I started eighth grade, I wanted to know if  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

subject + **would**/**might**/**could** + verb + \[object\]

(subject + verb + infinitive + **if** + subject + **would**/**might**/**could** + verb + \[object\])

- Say:

“Use this frame to talk about an outcome you were uncertain about when starting eighth grade. Use a verb in the conditional mood within the infinitive phrase of the sentence frame. Some topics you may want to consider discussing include habits of character, academic mindsets, or being in Grade 8.”

- Possible student answers:

**Before I started eighth grade, I wanted to know if <u>I would make new friends</u>**.

(subject + verb + infinitive + **if** + subject + **would**/**might**/**could** + verb + \[object\])
