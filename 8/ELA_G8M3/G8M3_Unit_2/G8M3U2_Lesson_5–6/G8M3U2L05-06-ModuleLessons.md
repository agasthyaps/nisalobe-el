Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.8.2a – Opening A: Students review the plan for their Proof Paragraphs, looking for areas of strength and places for improvement.

- W.8.2 – Work Time A: Students write an explanatory essay to examine the structure and theme in two texts, conveying ideas through the selection, organization, and analysis of relevant content.

- W.8.5 – Work Time B: Students review their partner’s work and provide feedback to help strengthen their peer’s writing.

- W.8.5 – Closing and Assessment A: Students develop and strengthen their writing with the support of peer feedback and revisions.

- In this lesson, students write the draft of their informative essay and receive peer feedback on maintaining a clear focus, using strategies to organize information, and using relevant facts, definitions, details, quotations, and examples to explain their thinking.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become an effective learner, practicing perseverance as they draft their informative essay, collaboration during the peer critique of their essays, and initiative and responsibility as they revise their essays. Students also show respect as they work to become ethical people as they analyze a peer’s informative essay and critique their work.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Have students write an additional essay independently to continue to practice the skills that have been scaffolded in this unit. Students may write about two texts they have read for Independent Research Reading or other texts they have encountered independently.

- Challenge students to include at least one sentence in their essay that uses passive voice to emphasize the result or recipient of an action.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lessons, students planned each component of their informative essay. They build on those foundations in this lesson as they draft their essay using their plans from Lessons 3 and 4.

Support All Students

- Revisit the model essay and/or read it aloud to remind students of the components of a Painted Essay® before students draft their essays. They may also visually display it in painted form. ▲

- Have students orally discuss their paragraphs before drafting their essays. ▲

- Essays can be drafted and edited using an online tool such as http://eled.org/0158. Peer sharing and critique can also be done this way using track changes.

- To set themselves up for success, students need to rely on the detailed planning they have done across the unit and all they have learned by practicing during their planning and analysis of the model essay. Before students begin drafting their essays, activate prior knowledge by reviewing important aspects of an informative essay together. ▲

- For Work Time B, preselect student partnerships to strategically group students who can be supportive of one another both in skills and in confidence and kindness and provide supportive partners for students who might struggle with the task. Model a kind and constructive critique or have a pair of students model this. Continually ground students in the ideas of Work to Become Ethical People. ▲

- Some students, especially ELLs, may struggle to recognize areas for improvement in their peers’ essays and may have difficulty articulating feedback. Pair students strategically to ensure ELLs are well-supported during the Peer Critique portion of the lesson. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson builds upon the planning work students have done in the previous two lessons. Students write the draft of their informative essay and exchange feedback with peers to improve the overall quality of their essay and to refine the use of transitions and domain-specific vocabulary.

- ELLs may find it challenging to articulate meaningful feedback for peers during the peer critique portion in Work Time B. Encourage students to rely on the materials they have been using in this lesson and previous lessons as resources for identifying what has been done effectively and what might need improvement. Remind students that when giving feedback to others, it is important to acknowledge both strengths and areas for growth; ELLs may find it easier to focus on noticing what has been done well in their peers’ essays.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.II.A.1 and 8.II.A.1.

Assessment Guidance

- Use the Grade 8 Writing Process checklist to assess students’ writing abilities in Work Time A (located on the Tools Page at http://eled.org/tools).

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will answer selected response questions on structure and theme for the mid-unit assessment.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.8.2a (10 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lessons 5–6**.

- Once all students are ready, invite students to use their answers on the Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lessons 5–6 and Turn and Talk:

“What are the strengths of your Proof Paragraphs?” (Responses will vary.)

“How are you going to strengthen your Proof Paragraphs?” (Responses will vary.)

- Remind students that in today’s lesson they will have the opportunity to use their essay plans and strengthen the work they planned in Lessons 3 and 4 as they draft their informative essays. As they draft their essays, ensure students focus on developing their Proof Paragraphs to meet the effective informative essay criteria, including maintaining the focus of their topic throughout the entire essay.

- Using a preferred classroom routine, collect or review the answers to **Homework: Structure and Theme: “In Flanders Fields”** from Lesson 4. Refer to the **Homework: Structure and Theme: “In Flanders Fields” (example for teacher reference**).

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Draft Informative Essay – W.8.2 (45 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can write an explanatory essay to examine and analyze the structure of two texts and the impact of structure on theme.”

- Invite students to retrieve or refer to the following materials:

- **Literary Analysis Informative Essay directions**

- **Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer**

- **Informative Writing checklist**

- **Painted Essay® template**

- **Model Literary Analysis Essay: Relationship of Structure to Meaning**

- **Transition Words handout**

- **Analyze a Model: Proof Paragraphs 1a and 1b**

- **Analyze a Model: Proof Paragraphs 2a and 2b**

- **Structure anchor chart**

- Remind students that they will draft their essays about the structure and meaning of two texts using the plans they used in previous lessons to develop their topic. Explain to students that they will draft their essay independently, then they will use peer critique to revise their essays. Additionally, remind students that they will apply their knowledge of analyzing structure and theme when they take the mid-unit assessment in the next lesson.

- Distribute **word processing devices** for students to type their essays.

- Display the Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer and read the prompt aloud as students follow along silently:

- “Write an essay in which you compare the theme of *Maus I* and “Often a Minute,” and analyze how the differing structures contribute to that theme.”

- Focus students on Proof Paragraphs 2a and 2b. Remind students that they’ve written about theme in previous lessons, to ensure they use their knowledge of theme analysis, and to pay special attention to their paragraphs that analyze text structure, a new skill they’ve developed in this unit.

- Invite students to refer to their Informative Writing checklist, briefly rereading the criteria and then answering the question below.

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“Based on feedback you have received while planning your essay in previous lessons, are there any specific criteria you should focus on from the checklist as you draft your essay?” (Responses will vary, but students should identify areas of growth they hope to concentrate on in their writing.)

- Answer clarifying questions about the task.

- Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart** and review *perseverance* and what this looks and sounds like. Remind students that as they will be drafting their full essay today, they may need to practice perseverance.

- Ask students to Turn and Talk:

“What aspects of perseverance will you work on during your drafting today?” (Answers will vary, but might be along the lines of the following: I will stick with my task and stay focused. I will ask clarifying questions when I need to. I will avoid distraction.)

- Invite students to begin drafting their essay.

- While students are drafting, circulate to monitor and document their essay writing skills. Support students as needed. Refer to the **Literary Analysis Informative Essay: Sample Student Response (example for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

- Repeat, inviting students to self-assess how well they persevered in this lesson.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time A, encourage students to Think-Pair-Share to generate a specific list of criteria to attend to as they draft their essays. Consider displaying the criteria that students will focus on during the peer critique in Work Time B for students to use as a guide in generating specific actions:

- W.8.2c: I use a variety of appropriate transitions to show how ideas and information connect.

- W.8.2d: I use precise language and domain-specific vocabulary.

- L.8.2: The spelling, capitalization, and punctuation are correct.

Work Time

B. Peer Critique – W.8.5 (20 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can give kind, helpful, and specific feedback to my partner.”

- Refocus class.

- Display and again focus students on their Informative Writing checklist.

- Focus students on the criteria:

- W.8.2a: I provide a clear focus and maintain the focus consistently throughout the piece.

- W.8.2a: I use strategies such as definition, classification, comparison/contrast, and cause/effect, to organize information.

- W.8.2b: I use relevant facts, definitions, details, quotations, and examples to explain my thinking.

- Invite students to mark or highlight these criteria, since they will be the focus of the critique.

- Turn and Talk:

“What do each of these criteria mean in your own words?”

- Move students into pairs and invite them to label themselves A and B.

- Distribute **sticky notes**.

- Focus students on the Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart, specifically *I collaborate*. Remind students that because they will critique their partner’s essay draft, they will need to use their listening and speaking skills to collaborate.

- Tell students they will use their Peer Critique to provide their partner with kind, specific, and helpful feedback.

- Focus students on the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**, and remind them specifically of respect and compassion. Remind students that the purpose of peer feedback is to help the other student improve his or her work, so when we provide feedback, we have to be careful to ensure we are respectful and compassionate.

- Display the **Directions for Peer Critique**, and read the directions aloud.

- Display the **Peer Critique Protocol anchor chart** and ask for volunteers to review what each criterion means, looks like, and sounds like from their responses recorded from Peer Critiques from previous lessons. See **Peer Critique Protocol anchor chart (for teacher reference)**.

- Invite students to provide feedback to their partner based on the Informative Writing checklist.

- Circulate to support students as they work together to give feedback to one another.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time B, before students exchange essays for feedback, invite them to spend time making a list of specific ways they address the following criteria in their own essays:

- W.8.2c: I use a variety of appropriate transitions to show how ideas and information connect.

- W.8.2d: I use precise language and domain-specific vocabulary.

- L.8.2: The spelling, capitalization, and punctuation are correct.

This will deepen the exchange between partners and give students the opportunity to ask meaningful questions about the feedback they receive.

For Heavier Support

- Before Work Time B, consider reviewing common comma usage with students to give them concrete, tangible things to look for in their own work and in their peers’ essays:

- We use commas before a coordinating conjunction that connects two independent clauses.

- We use commas after a dependent clause at the beginning of a sentence.

- We use commas after a transition word or adverb phrase at the beginning of a sentence.

- We use commas to separate list items (including before the word *and* the final item).

Closing and Assessment

A. Revise Informative Essay – W.8.5 (15 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can revise my writing based on peer feedback.”

- Focus students on the Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart, and remind them of initiative and responsibility as they revise their work.

- Invite students to revise their writing using the peer feedback, and circulate to support students as they revise their work. If necessary, model reading through several of a volunteer’s peer suggestions and considering how best to implement them. Remind students that they may thoughtfully reject some suggestions and to use their vocabulary logs, the word walls, and a dictionary to check spelling.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- Provide sentence starters that students can use to respond to the questions meaningfully as they discuss their essays:

- This piece of work meets or exceeds the criteria by \_\_\_\_\_.

- This work is unique because \_\_\_\_\_.

- This piece of work is worthy of honoring a voice of a Holocaust voice because \_\_\_\_\_.

- The “Importance of Remembering This Theme” can be improved by \_\_\_\_\_.

- \_\_\_\_\_ would make this work stronger.

- Point out that many of these sentence frames can be completed using gerund phrases to reinforce their learning about verbals earlier in the module.
