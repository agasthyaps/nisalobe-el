**“We Wear the Mask”**

**By Paul Laurence Dunbar**

We wear the mask that grins and lies,

It hides our cheeks and shades our eyes,—

This debt we pay to human guile;

With torn and bleeding hearts we smile,

And mouth with myriad subtleties.

Why should the world be over-wise,

In counting all our tears and sighs?

Nay, let them only see us, while

We wear the mask.

We smile, but, O great, our cries

To thee from tortured souls arise.

We sing, but oh the clay is vile

Beneath our feet, and long the mile;

But let the world dream otherwise,

We wear the mask!

16. How is this theme similar or different to that of *Maus I*?

Answers will vary. The themes in both works are similar, as they both relate to oppression. In *Maus I*, one theme addresses the immeasurable human will to survive and preserve in the face of oppression. In “We Wear the Mask,” the theme addresses defeat, suggesting even in the face of oppression, you can choose to maintain your self-respect.

17. What structure does the author use to contribute to this meaning?

18. a narrative with a beginning, middle, and end that tells a story of fear

19. escription of features and examples to create a vivid picture of weakness

20. <u>chorus of a repeated stanza to highlight the theme of maintaining pride</u>

21. a stance about being greater than others with information that follows

22. How is this structure different from or similar to the structure Art Spiegelman uses to contribute to the meaning of *Maus I*?

Spiegelman uses the father’s flashbacks to a chronological recounting of his life to portray this theme, while, in contrast, Dunbar uses a chorus to emphasize a point throughout the poem. “We wear the mask” appears at the beginning, middle, and end of the poem, drawing attention to a group of oppressed people who hide their pain and maintain their self-respect.
