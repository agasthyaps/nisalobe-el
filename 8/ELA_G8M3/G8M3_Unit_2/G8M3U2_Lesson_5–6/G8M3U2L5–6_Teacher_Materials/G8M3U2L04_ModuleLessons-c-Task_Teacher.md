Analyze a Model: Proof Paragraphs 2a and 2b

W.8.2

(Example for Teacher Reference)

Proof Paragraphs: What does it look like to support the focus with evidence in this literary analysis?

Focus Statement

Two texts that we have read, *The Summer of the Mariposas* and “The Blind Men and the Elephant,” explore this topic of encountering new ideas or people. Each comes to a different theme about the topic, and each uses a different structure to make that theme clear to the reader.

<p>Begins the paragraph with a transitional statement that connects the first two Proof Paragraphs (about theme) to this one (about structure). States the point that the two texts use different structures. <em>Summer of the Mariposas</em> uses a chronological plot structure.</p></td>

<td>From the very beginning of the story, Odilia and her sisters go through a series of events and obstacles on their journey. They repeatedly encounter La Llorona. Early in the story, La Llorona is telling the girls that she “is not here to harm” them, and that she does not snatch children (50). Odilia knows how strange it is to be talking to a ghost, but she continues to talk with La Llorona and listen to her. After several more encounters, Odilia continues to learn that what she was taught about La Llorona is not actually true. By the end of the story, Odilia gives La Llorona flowers, and she is now transformed from a tired and middle-aged figure to “radiant and alive” (323). Odilia realizes that this is a new world, that La Llorona is no longer what she seemed.</td>
