Directions for Peer Critique

1.  Partner A and B read each other’s essays, circling places where they believe details, quotations, and examples to explain their thinking should be included.

2.  Partners may also identify examples where spelling needs to be corrected. Finally, partners circle domain-specific vocabulary or places where they think domain-specific vocabulary could be added. Partners may refer to the domain-specific word wall as needed.

3.  Each partner generates suggestions for adding details or examples as well as domain-specific vocabulary in the margins of their partner’s essay.

4.  Partner A identifies one star (one thing your partner did well) and records it on a sticky note.

- Example: “I noticed you included this quote to explain your thinking.”

5.  Partner A identifies one step (one thing your partner could improve) and records it on a different-colored sticky note.

- Example: “Could you add an example here to help the reader better understand your explanation?”

6.  Switch roles and repeat steps 1–4.

7.  Explain your feedback, partner A first, then partner B.

8.  Ask your partner clarifying questions if you don’t understand.
