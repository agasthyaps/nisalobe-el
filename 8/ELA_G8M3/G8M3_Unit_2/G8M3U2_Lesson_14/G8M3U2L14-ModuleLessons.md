Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RL.8.1 – Work Time A: Students deepen their understanding of experiences of Holocaust victims and survivors by recording notices and wonders of Holocaust voices.

- W.8.10 – Work Time B: Students complete a QuickWrite in which they reflect on their experiences in the Commemorative Poster Share and record their thoughts about new learning and the themes and summaries presented in various posters.

- SL.8.1 – Closing and Assessment A: Students engage in collaborative discussion about the Commemorative Posters they viewed and convey new learning or connections they made during the Commemorative Poster Share.

- In this lesson, students directly work to become ethical people by naming ways they can show respect, integrity, and empathy as they view voices of the Holocaust in the Commemorative Poster Share. Students work to keep a respectful tone throughout the class, and honor ways in which they saw their peers uphold these expectations.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Provide time for students to see more posters than Work Time A allows for. Consider other ways for students to view additional posters—using more class time, keeping the posters on classroom walls for a longer period of time, or using protocols that allow for more sharing.

- Allow students the opportunity to present their posters to additional audiences, or arrange for them to be on display in a common space in the school.

- Suggest students share their posters, and the learning from their peers’ posters, with their families. Students may also wish to extend the QuickWrite to a more thorough reflection.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Students practiced writing objective summaries in Lessons 8–11 and then selected one of those summaries and used it to create a poster in Lesson 12. In this lesson, students share their poster with an audience of peers to increase their overall understanding of important themes in Holocaust survivors’ experiences.

Support All Students

- Some students may find the somber tone of the Commemorative Poster Share uncomfortable and react in different ways (e.g., nervous laughter, wanting to leave). Reviewing the expectations during Opening A will be extremely important to set the tone of the lesson, and within this, acknowledge that it might be uncomfortable, and that is okay.

- Post written directions (on the board or projector) for the steps students should follow during the Commemorative Poster Share. This will allow students to refer back to them, as needed, work silently, and keep the intended tone for the sharing.

- The Notices and Wonders note- catcher will help keep students focused on the task during the Commemorative Poster Share. As needed, prompt students to move on to the next poster and provide reminders that increase engagement.

- Discuss with students in advance what they might want to look for during the Commemorative Poster Share and what kind of notes they can add to their Notices and Wonders note-catcher. ▲

- The Notices and Wonders note-catcher has space for students to record notices and wonders from five student posters. Set expectations ahead of time for the class or with particular students regarding the number posters they should visit. Students could add more rows to their note-catcher as needed, or visit fewer posters.

- Give students the option of sharing in writing or orally after the Commemorative Poster Share. Some students may be in a very quiet, reflective state after this experience and not be motivated to engage in lively conversation. The silent quick write, prior to the group discussion will provide students the opportunity to reflect and gather salient talking points prior to the conversation. ▲

- Note there is a differentiated version of QuickWrite: Reflect on Commemorative Posters used in Work Time B in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Convert the class set of the Holocaust Commemorative Posters into an online format such as http://eled.org/0158, and create a shared resource that a broader audience could review (parents, other classes, teachers, etc.).

- Consider playing calming music during the Commemorative Poster Share to match the tone of respect and honoring.

- To support ELLs, this lesson gives students time to share their learning and honor the victims of the Holocaust that they have read about over the course of the unit. The commemorative poster display is also an opportunity for students to practice habit of character and empathy and respect.

- ELLs may find it challenging to articulate their thoughts on the posters on both the Commemorative Poster Share note-catcher and during the QuickWrite. Students may benefit from an opportunity to process their notices and wonders orally before recording them in writing.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.C.11 and 8.I.C.12.

Assessment Guidance

- Review the Notices and Wonders student note-catcher to make sure they meet the criteria determined in Work Time A, and ensure student work aligns to the respectful tone of the task.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will begin Module 3, Unit 3. In this unit, students will increase their understanding of the people, players, and events of the Holocaust by narrowing in on people who acted as upstanders. Students will read nonfiction accounts of individuals or groups who resisted the Nazi regime, hid Jewish people, or smuggled them out of danger, writing reflective paragraphs about each.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner and Set Tone for Commemorative Poster Share – SL.8.1 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 14**.

- Prompt students to Turn and Talk about their answers to the entrance ticket. Cold-call students to share out, taking time to review the expectations for the silent Commemorative Poster Share. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 14 (answers for teacher reference)**.

- In addition to reviewing the Commemorative Poster Share guidelines students reflected on in the entrance ticket, take time to set an intentional tone for the remainder of the lesson. Remind students of their conversations about the importance of memorializing that they had in Lesson 13, and reiterate the importance of showing respect while honoring voices of the Holocaust in their class today.

- As a way to set the respectful tone, prompt students to Think-Pair-Share about the following questions:

“How will you show empathy in today’s Commemorative Poster Share and reflection?” (Answers will vary, but may include the following: I seek to understand the experiences of others, I will read and view the voices of the Holocaust presented carefully, looking for connections I have between my own Commemorative Poster and the ones presented, and I will look for new details and information that expand my understanding of the events and impacts of the Holocaust.)

“How will you show integrity in today’s Commemorative Poster Share and reflection?” (Answers will vary, but may include I will stay on task, and help my peers do the same.)

“How will you show respect in today’s Commemorative Poster Share and reflection?” (Answers will vary, but may include the following: I will keep a serious tone and support my peers to do the same; I will appreciate the experiences of others and reserve judgement, etc.)

- Lift up any high-leverage responses, and share them with the group, naming strategies students can use to show the utmost respect, integrity, and empathy in their work today.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Silent Commemorative Poster Share – RI.8.1 (25 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can deepen my understanding of Holocaust victims’ and survivors’ experiences by recording notices and wonders of Holocaust voices.”

- Refer to the **Module Guiding Questions anchor chart** and read them aloud:

“What was the Holocaust and how did it occur? Why do we remember it?”

“How did victims and survivors respond, and how can we honor their voices?”

- Allow students to reflect on their growth in understanding towards these questions that were introduced in Lesson 1 of Unit 1. Prompt students to Think-Pair-Share, describe their growth and increase in understanding of one of the questions.

- Tell students that today’s class offers them the opportunity to work towards both of those questions—remembering the Holocaust and honoring voices of it.

- Display the **Model Commemorative Poster**, and think aloud together, asking students to brainstorm with a partner:

“If this were a poster they were viewing, what kinds of things might they notice?” (Answers will vary, but students may mention connections to their own poster, differences that stand out, striking images, common themes, etc.)

“If this were a poster they were viewing, what kind of things might they wonder?” (Answers will vary, but students may mention specific questions about Abe’s experience, or about the challenges survivors, as well as victims, faced, etc.)

- Then, distribute and display the **Commemorative Poster Share note-catcher**. Explain to students that they will use this note-catcher as they view each other’s Commemorative Posters to capture the types of notices and wonders they just brainstormed.

- Point students to the example row at the top of the note-catcher, and using the **Commemorative Poster Share note-catcher (for teacher reference)**, provide additional examples for students of the types of notices and wonders they might write down for each poster. Allow students to ask questions about this note-catcher and review any specific expectations for students.

- Prior to releasing students to work, describe the procedure for sharing the commemorative posters. Tell students they should follow these directions silently:

- Start at one poster. Select one that is available and not crowded with other students.

- Read all parts of the poster—the included summary, theme statement and view the images and the importance of the theme section—and take notes on their Commemorative Poster Share note-catcher.

- At their own pace, and as they finish their observations, students move on to another Holocaust Commemorative poster, repeating the steps from above.

- Visit as many posters as possible in the allotted time, while still reading carefully and viewing each poster in a thoughtful manner.

- Remind students that they should keep a respectful tone and show integrity as they proceed around the room, visiting multiple posters without conversing with peers. Invite students to begin working.

- As students work, circulate, and provide support for students who may need encouragement to stay on track or additional models of what to capture on their note-catchers.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

B. QuickWrite: Reflect on Commemorative Posters – W.8.10 (5 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can reflect on the commemorative posters presented in the Commemorative Poster Share and name connections or new learning that increased my empathy for the Holocaust voices shared.”

- Distribute the **QuickWrite: Reflect on Commemorative Posters**, and prompt students to begin reading the task. Tell students that they have 5 minutes to silently reflect on their experiences in writing before they will share orally in Closing and Assessment A. For ELLs and students who require additional support, **QuickWrite: Reflect on Commemorative Posters** ▲ can be used to guide students’ language production with sentence frames.

- Direct students to pick any or all of the suggested prompts, and encourage students to write continuously until time is up.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time B, invite students who need heavier support to use QuickWrite: Reflect on Commemorative Posters ▲. This resource has sentence frames to help students formulate their responses.

Closing and Assessment

A. Group Share– SL.8.1 (10 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can thoughtfully participate in a discussion that commemorates voices of the Holocaust.”

- Direct students to join together for a whole group share. Invite them to review the questions on their QuickWrite and clarify the expectations for the discussion. Tell students that the discussion is an open space for them to share connections, new learning, questions, and reactions they had to the Commemorative Poster Share.

- Tell students that they should take turns speaking, sharing their responses to the questions posed, and building upon one another’s responses. They should provide evidence from their note-catcher to strengthen and clarify their comments. Remind students that their responses should recognize voices and experiences of the Holocaust with empathy and a respectful tone.

- Pose the first question to the class.

“What new or important facts, details, or information did you learn?” (Answers will vary.)

- Prompt students to build upon each other’s responses to this question, and when appropriate, move on to the remaining questions, pausing to lift up any comments or push students to clarify their thinking. Progress through the questions at an appropriate pace.

“What new or important notices did you have about the themes presented in the Commemorative Posters? (Are there trends in the themes that stand out? Or any unique themes that spoke to you?)” (Answers will vary.)

“What questions are lingering?” (Answers will vary)

“What else is on your mind?” (Answers will vary)

- As a closing, have students reflect, once again, on the module guiding questions, prompting them to note any new observations about how we can honor voices of the Holocaust or why we remember it.

“What was the Holocaust, and how did it occur? Why do we remember it?”

“How did victims and survivors respond, and how can we honor their voices?”

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing ways students observed peers showing empathy, integrity, and respect in the Poster Share and reflection while working to keep a respectful tone. Prompt responses about what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- Invite students to share what their partners said to promote attentive listening, retelling, paraphrasing, and peer language modeling. Since students are accustomed to sharing out their own answer, explain why this is helpful and provide them with frames and a model first: “My partner (or name of student) said \_\_\_\_.”

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
