<td><ul>
<li><p><em>Abe’s Story</em> describes life in a Ghetto, and the voice I summarized also explained about being removed from their home and placed in a crowded ghetto.</p></li>
<li><p>I learned details of the ghetto that I was not aware of before—that water and food was limited, and disease was common.</p></li>
<li><p>Abe must have had tremendous perseverance to leave his family and risk his life in trying to save theirs.</p></li>
<li><p>The theme “Survival Sometimes Requires Us to Make Difficult Choices” connects to many other texts we’ve read, and reminds me of Vladek’s story in <em>Maus I</em>. It makes me realize that although the survivors made it out of the Holocaust with their lives, the choices were often unbearable and had a huge impact on the rest of their lives.</p></li>
</ul></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>How many people survived the Ghettos, and how many people perished in them?</p></li>
<li><p>It is striking to see the images of Jewish people, and it brought up a lot of sadness for me. People are surrounded by all of their belongings, and we know those will soon be lost. I wonder how people coped with the loss of significant items (photos, keepsakes, etc.) and what happened to all of these items? Were they burned, destroyed, stolen?</p></li>
