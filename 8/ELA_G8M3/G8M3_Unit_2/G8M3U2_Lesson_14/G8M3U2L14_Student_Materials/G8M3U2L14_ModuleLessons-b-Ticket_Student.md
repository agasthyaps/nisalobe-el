2.  Work is posted around the room or in the hallway for all to view.

3.  Students work silently and rotate around the room without interacting with peers.

4.  Students visit as many posters as possible in the time given.

5.  Students carefully view each poster, reading and synthesizing the summary, theme, and visuals presented.

6.  Students use the given note-catcher to capture notices and wonders.

7.  Students are prepared to share out key takeaways and big ideas from the Gallery Walk in the debrief.
