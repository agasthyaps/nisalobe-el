Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.8.2 – Work Time A: Students use the Painted Essay® structure to examine a model literary analysis essay and add to their understanding of the criteria of an effective informative essay.

- W.8.4 – Work Time A: Students analyze the organization and development of a model informative essay, reflecting on how the organization of each paragraph relates to the author’s purpose.

- W.8.4 – Work Time B: Students use a model informative essay and the Informative Writing Checklist to analyze how the essay conveys ideas, concepts, and information through the selection, organization, and analysis of relevant content and then generate specific criteria for their own essays.

- L.8.1a – Work Time C: Students are introduced to the structures of gerund and infinitive phrases and work to explain how these verbals function within sentences in a model essay.

- RL.8.5 – Closing and Assessment A: Students view an anchor chart listing various literary structures and begin to think about how the structures contribute to the meaning of a text.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become ethical people, showing integrity as they discuss ideas from *Summer of the Mariposas* and the poem “The Blind Men and the Elephant.” They also focus on working to become effective learners, persevering as they read and analyze the model essay with partners and independently.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Invite students to explore structures in various texts—their independent research reading book, texts from previous modules, texts they have read in the past. Provide time for students to examine and discuss these structures with peers, or suggest students have similar discussions at home regarding texts their family is reading.

- Before sharing the model essay with students, ask students to predict what they think some of the similarities and differences might be between *Summer of the Mariposas* and the poem “The Blind Men and the Elephant” or between the novel and poems, in general.

- Allow students to look for examples of infinitives and gerunds in other texts and to then share these with classmates as examples of the variety of ways in which these are used.

- After Work Time C, invite students to move from analyzing gerund and infinitive phrases to using them. Challenge students to write five sentences about *Maus I* that include at least one gerund or infinitive phrase.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Students have worked with the Painted Essay® structure in previous modules. In this unit, they analyze how the same basic structure is applied to this new essay prompt, noticing how the author compares and contrasts theme and structure in the model.

- The model essay students analyze compares the themes and structures used in *Summer of the Mariposas* and the poem “The Blind Men and the Elephant,” examining how the structures contribute to meaning in the texts. Although students wrote a compare and contrast essay in Module 1, this essay exhibits more complexity by requiring students to identify and compare themes as well as structure in the texts. The essay will have four Proof Paragraphs, which is a new and important format for students to identify in the model essay and apply when planning their own writing in upcoming lessons.

Support All Students

- Presenting learning targets and directions in writing, orally, and if possible, accompanied by symbols will help students to understand the language within them. ▲

- For students who may be overwhelmed by too much print on a page, reduce anxiety and support sustained effort by offering a copy of the model essay with one paragraph per page. ▲

- Students may require additional support when reading for gist. Pair students heterogeneously for this activity, or read aloud to a group of students who may need additional reading support. ▲

- Some students may require additional support reading for gist in pairs. Group students who may need additional support in one group for additional guidance. ▲

- Whole-group discussions, like the one about the model essay in Work Time A can be intimidating for ELLs; support them with sentence starters and/or a list of appropriate language to help them navigate.▲

- Giving students the Informative Writing checklist prior to reading the model essay can help guide their analysis. For comparison of multiple essay types, having a model informative essay to refer back to may help. For heavier support, elements that are similar in the two essays can be color-coded or annotated to draw students’ attention to them.

- The Informative Writing checklist used in Work Time B is a consistent resource in all grades. Consider the amount of detail needed in modeling this for students.

- Consider providing students with The Painted Essay® template (one per student; from Module 1), as needed, as an additional support in Work Time B when students are analyzing the model essay. ▲

- Providing students individual, filled-in copies of the anchor charts that will be used in this module could support a more nuanced understanding for some students of the characteristics they are examining in each writing format and allow them to have a greater understanding of the expectations for their own writing.

- To support ELLs, this lesson includes scaffolded work with analyzing a model compare and contrast essay that uses the Painted Essay® format and analyzing the structure of texts. Students will consider the structure of *Maus I* and the way in which the author uses dialogue, chronology, and flashbacks to tell his father’s story. Students will participate in a mini lesson on the form and function of gerunds and infinitives and the relationships between words and phrases in sentences (L.8.1a,L.8.5b). The lesson includes collaborative discussion and familiar routines to help students navigate both the writing and language content and skills that they will encounter.

- ELLs may find it challenging to navigate the breadth of concepts and tasks presented in this lesson. Students will be exploring a number of things for the first time: structure in texts, a compare and contrast essay format that identifies similarities and differences in structure within texts, and the grammatical concept of verbals. Encourage students to consider all that they already learned that will inform their work in each portion of this lesson and refer back to content and concepts from Modules 1 and 2 where possible.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6 and 8.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- Throughout Work Time A, frequently review student work to ensure students are color-coding accurately. Use common issues as whole group teaching points.

- During Work Time B analyze student annotations of the model towards aligned criteria on the Informative Writing checklist and use any common issues of misconceptions as whole group teaching points.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will closely read the poem “Often a Minute,” analyzing the language, structures, and theme to prepare to write their own essay.

- In this lesson, students are exposed to the prompt for the informative essays they will begin planning in Lessons 3 and 4. They will examine the prompt in depth in Lesson 3 prior to planning their essays and then write their essays in Lessons 5–6.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.8.2 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 1**.

- Once students are ready, invite them to share their answers on the Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 1.

- Cold-call students to share their answers to questions 2 and 3 with the group. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 1 (answers for teacher reference)**. Highlight the key components of a literary analysis essay, and allow students to recognize their growth as a writer.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read and Analyze a Model – W.8.2 (15 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify the parts of a model literary analysis essay and explain the purpose of each.”

- Prompt students to Pair-Share:

“What are some important elements of an informative essay?” (Answers will vary, but should reference the use of a focus statement in the introduction, points that are explained with evidence, and elaboration in the Proof Paragraphs.)

- Tell students they will be writing another informative essay in this unit. Introduce students to their essay prompt: “Write an essay in which you compare the themes of *Maus I* and ‘Often a Minute,’ and analyze how the differing structures contribute to each theme.”

- Explain that students will answer the prompt with information from two texts, *Maus I* and the poem “Often a Minute,” which they will read and analyze during a close read in the next lesson. In order to write this essay, they will first analyze a model essay.

- Tell students that similar to their La Llorona essays, the new model essay is also an informative, literary analysis essay that asks students to use compare and contrast thinking in their analysis. The new model essay compares differences and similarities in the theme and structure of two texts and how that contributes to meaning. In the model essay, one text is *Summer of the Mariposas*, which they should remember well from Module 1. The other text is the poem called “The Blind Men and the Elephant” that they read for homework last night. Review the gist of the poem. (Gist: Six blind men encounter different parts of an elephant, leads each to limited experiences and differing incorrect perspectives on what an elephant is.)

- Tell students that when we refer to structure, we are describing the way a writer organizes and builds the text they write. Texts have varying structures that are intentionally chosen to help readers understand the overall meaning.

- Prompt students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What types of literary writing structures do you know about from previous writing or reading experiences?” (Answers will vary, but might include flashbacks, sequential order, etc.)

- Tell students that it is okay if they don’t know many literary writing structures at this point. They will have the opportunity to discuss these structures later today and in their work throughout the unit.

- Distribute and display the **Model Literary Analysis Essay: Relationship of Structure to Meaning**. Read the model aloud as students follow along, reading silently.

- Using a total participation technique, invite responses from the group:

“What is this text about?” (The essay analyzes how two texts explore the idea of encountering new ideas or new people. It compares and contrasts the themes and structures in *Summer of the Mariposas* and “The Blind Men and the Elephant” and how these contribute to meaning.)

- Refocus students on the model, directing them to the first Proof Paragraph. Reread the paragraph aloud as students to follow along, reading silently.

- Ask students to Turn and Talk:

“What is the main point discussed in this first Proof Paragraph?” (The novel *Summer of the Mariposas* explores the concept of new people and things and conveys the theme that people and ideas are not always what they appear, but that it is possible to uncover the truth and learn something new.)

- Tell students that in this paragraph the author explores the concept of encountering new and different people, by writing about Odilla’s experiences with a character that is different from her. Prompt students to reread the paragraph with a partner. Point out that most of the paragraph is evidence, and the last sentence in the paragraph is the elaboration and reveals the theme. Prompt students to underline this sentence in their model.

- Explain to students that in this compare and contrast essay the author wrote a yellow Proof Paragraph for each text discussed. Prompt them to look at the next Proof Paragraph, and have them also underline this paragraph in yellow. Explain that this Proof Paragraph is about the second text, “The Blind Men and the Elephant,” and similar to the previous paragraph, it also explains how characters encounter new and different ideas. Point out that most of the paragraph is evidence, and the last sentence in the paragraph is the elaboration and reveals the theme. It explains that although the topic is the same, the themes are different. The paragraph ends in a sentence that names the theme, that people, ideas, and things are not always what they appear and that it is possible to ignore the truth and not learn anything. Prompt students to underline this sentence in their model.

- Tell students that we will be referring to the first two Proof Paragraphs as a set, and labelling them Proof Paragraph 1a and Proof Paragraph 1b.

- Focus students on the rest of model, directing them to notice that there are still two more Proof Paragraphs (Proof Paragraph 2a and Proof Paragraph 2b). Comment on how this structure of having four total Proof Paragraphs is different from previous informative essays they have written.

- Direct students to reread the final two Proof Paragraphs aloud with a partner, underlining them in blue as they read.

- Ask:

“Why did you underline these paragraphs in blue?” (Because they are discussing Point 2, that each uses a different structure to make that theme clear to the reader.)

- Explain to students that these two Proof Paragraphs form a set, and each is about one of the texts (*Summer of the Mariposas* and “The Blind Men and the Elephant”). However, instead of describing new experiences the characters have and how that leads to differing themes, these paragraphs identify and describe the structures used in each text and how they contribute to understanding the themes. Ask students to Turn and Talk:

“What structures are identified and explained in Proof Paragraph 2a and 2b?” (A chronological structure is used in *Summer of the Mariposas*, and stanzas are used as a structure in “The Blind Men and the Elephant.”)

- Tell students that they will have additional time to learn and discuss varying structures writers use during Closing and Assessment A of this lesson and in future lessons.

- Also explain to students that they will have time, in Lessons 3 and 4, to discuss the elements of these Proof Paragraphs in more detail as they plan their essay.

- Direct students to color-code any additional or remaining paragraphs in their model essay, making sure all paragraphs are coded according to the Painted Essay® structure they have used in previous modules. Remind students to use their **Painted Essay® template** for reference as needed. Refer to the **Paint an Essay lesson plan** for further detail.

- Direct students to the **Characteristics of a Literary Analysis Essay anchor chart**, and capture any significant notices from the model literary analysis, such as how the model contains four Proof Paragraphs.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time A, cut the model essay into strips that have one or two sentences on them. Distribute these to groups of students, and invite them to unscramble the essay before beginning the analysis. This will help to draw students’ attention to the content and to the structure that the author uses to present the information.

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from the poem “Often a Minute” to explore the use of an infinitive phrase, figurative language, and tone. Consider providing ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Invite students who need lighter support to predict some of the questions that the Language Dive may ask. This will improve students’ metacognition and challenge their awareness of the most interesting or meaningful elements of the sentence.

For Heavier Support

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from the poem “Often a Minute” to explore the use of an infinitive phrase, figurative language, and tone. Consider providing ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Encourage students who need heavier support to independently reflect on this sentence and its meaning before the next lesson. Students may also wish to add any unknown vocabulary to their vocabulary logs.

Work Time

B. Analyze Criteria: Informative Writing Checklist – W.8.4 (10 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can determine criteria for an effective literary analysis essay.”

- Distribute and display the **Informative Writing checklist**. Invite students to read the checklist to themselves.

- Remind students that they have used this checklist multiple times in previous writing tasks, and inform them that they will look closely at the checklist today, analyzing how the model meets all the criteria and paying specific attention to the following:

- “W.8.2a: I use strategies such as definition, classification, comparison/contrast and cause/effect, to organize information.”

- “W.8.2b: I use relevant facts, definitions, details, quotations, and examples to explain my thinking.”

- Give students a few minutes to reread the Model Literary Analysis Essay: Relationship of Structure to Meaning with the named criteria in mind.

- Prompt students to find a partner, labeling one student partner A and one student partner B.

- Direct partner A to share examples of where the writer met W.8.2a and used strategies of comparison/contrast to organize information in the model. Allow students time to discuss areas where the writer successfully used comparison and contrast in the work and annotate this on their checklist before moving on to partner B.

- Prompt partner B to share examples of where the writer met W.8.2b and used relevant facts, definitions, details, quotations, and examples to explain thinking in the model. Allow students time to discuss areas where the writer successfully used evidence and explained thinking in the work and annotate these on the checklist before regrouping all students together.

- Use a total participation technique to invite responses from the group:“How do the new elements of the model essay align to the criteria in the checklist?” (Students should notice that there are four Proof Paragraphs and that aligns to criteria W.8.2b.)“What overall characteristics on this checklist do you see done well in the model? What evidence from the model supports your thinking?” (Answers will vary.)

- As students share out the characteristics, jot down, say aloud, sketch, and display each characteristic to provide visual reinforcement. Reassure students that they might not understand everything on this checklist right now, but they will learn more about it as they plan and write their essays.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

C. Introduce Gerunds and Infinitive Phrases – L.8.1a (10 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can explain the function of gerund and infinitive phrases.”

- Remind students that they have explored the structure and function of gerunds and infinitives during Language Dives in Modules 1 and 2. Display and review the structures of gerunds and infinitives:

- verb + - *ing* = gerund

Example: *writing*

- to + verb = infinitive

Example: *to* *write*

- Explain that a gerund phrase is a phrase that starts with a gerund and an infinitive phrase is a phrase that starts with an infinitive. Display the following examples and invite students to identify the gerund and infinitive at the beginning of each phrase (*writing*, *to write*):

- verb + - *ing* + (object) = gerund phrase:

Example: *Writing an essay that compares and contrasts two texts*

- to + verb +(object) = infinitive phrase

Example: *To write an essay that compares and contrasts two texts*

- Refocus students’ attention on Model Literary Analysis Essay: Relationship of Structure to Meaning. Invite students to take one minute to scan the essay for gerund and infinitive phrases before asking students to share out the phrase they identified.

- Call on students to share examples of gerund and infinitive phrases. Record responses on the **Gerund and Infinitive Phrases anchor chart**. Reference the **Gerund and Infinitive Phrases anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** as needed. Add any non-examples students share to the non-example column to highlight that other phrases can seem deceptively similar to gerunds and infinitives. (Note: It is a phrase’s function in a sentence \[noun, adjective, adverb\] that determines whether it is a gerund or infinitive, rather than the presence of an - *ing* ending or the word *to*.)

- Say:

“To determine whether something is a gerund or infinitive phrase we need to think about the relationships between words in a sentence to understand the function of the phrase. A phrase’s function is the part of speech it takes on in a sentence. A gerund phrase functions as a noun in a sentence, which means it can be a subject or object (of a verb or preposition). An infinitive phrase can function as a noun, adjective, or adverb.”

- Distribute **Selected and Constructed Response Questions: Gerund and Infinitive Phrases** and direct students’ attention to the two sentences from the introduction of the model essay.

- Say:

“I’ll give you time to talk with a partner to determine whether the underlined phrases are gerund or infinitive phrases and what their function is in each sentence.”

- Allow students time to discuss each sentence with a partner before regrouping all students together to review students’ responses.

- Use a total participation technique to invite responses from the group. Refer to **Selected and Constructed Response Questions: Gerund and Infinitive Phrases (for teacher reference)** as necessary to support students.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Closing and Assessment

A. Debrief: Analyze Text Structures – RL.8.5 (5 minutes)

- Display the **Structure anchor chart**, and ask a student to read the structures listed in the “Common Structures Used in Narratives” section of the chart. Explain to students that writers typically use a particular structure in their writing, and the structure determines how the text is organized. Often these structures help the writer clearly convey meaning.

- Direct students to the second section of the chart, “Common Structures Used in Poetry.” Explain that this section names structures in poetry, and similar to structures used in narratives, a writer may use these within a poem to help her achieve a desired result. Authors may even use more than one of these structures to support their meaning.

- Prompt students to review the list with a partner, commenting on any structural elements they may have used or heard of in the past. As students discuss, monitor and field any questions that arise and clarify any misconceptions about literary structures.

- Ask students to identify the different literary structures highlighted in the analysis described in the model essay. Cold-call on a student to share out (chronological order and stanzas).

- Prompt students to Think-Pair-Share:

“Think back to our anchor text, *Maus I*. What structures did the author, Art Spiegelman, use in this book?” (The author primarily used a chronological structure, with flashbacks.)

- Ask students to review the Structure anchor chart and read the descriptions of chronological structure (the author provides the reader with chronological events) and flashback (an interruption in the normal sequence of events in a literary narrative that draws attention to something that happened at an earlier time). Then, ask:

“Why do you think these structures were used?” (By using the flashback structure, the author was able to develop narrative two plot lines—one in current day, of Art interviewing his father, and one in the past, that revealed Vladek’s experiences in the Holocaust. Additionally, the chronological order of Vladek’s story makes it clear and helps us understand the plot line of his narrative.)

“How do you think the text would be different if Art Spiegelman had not used the flashback structure?” (Answers will vary, but students may mention that the reader would not have had as vivid of picture of Vladek’s life and history; they would’ve missed out on the specifics and details of his experience in the Holocaust. The back and forth sequencing between present and past also helps the reader understand Vladek better.)

“How does the chronological structure of Vladek’s story contribute to the meaning in?” Maus I(Using a chronological plot structure in *Maus I* allows the reader to see the many challenges and choices Vladek must face. Time after time he faces a challenge and works to persevere through it and get back to his family. This structure helps highlight the themes that humans have an incredible will to survive and to protect their family, and that it’s important to tell stories of the past, even if those stories are painful.)

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Answer Constructed and Selected Response Questions

- Students complete **Homework: Gist, Theme, and Infinitive Phrases** to answer selected and constructed response questions about language and meaning in “Often a Minute” and the model essay.
