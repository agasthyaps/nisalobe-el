![](media/image1.png) Guiding Questions and Big Ideas

How did victims and survivors respond, and how can we honor their voices?

- *Victims and survivors maintained hope and a will to live and faced unspeakable challenges in order to try to survive and to protect those they loved.*

- *Victims and survivors maintained their dignity, respect, and humanity throughout unimaginable pain and hardship.*

- *Victims and survivors shared their voices through poetry, memoirs, and other tellings of their stories that help us remember and learn from this terrible chapter of history.*

What will your student be doing at school?

Throughout this unit your child will continue to engage in a variety of experiences that grow their understanding of the Holocaust and increase their literacy skills. As readers, students build a robust toolbox that helps them analyze, understand, and enjoy texts. Students in Grade 8 pay attention to various literary devices and components in the texts they read, and classroom instruction is aligned to support their fluency with these components. Some of these experiences and literacy components are outlined below.

**Read Poetry by Holocaust Survivors and Victims:** Students analyze the structure and themes in poems written about the Holocaust and compare them to structures and themes in the anchor text read in Unit 1, *Maus I*.

- Examples of Poems read in class: “Often a Minute” by Magdalena Klein, “The Owl” by Edward Thomas, and “In Flanders Fields” by John McCrae.

**Examine Text Structures:** Writers use structures to organize the content in a text or piece of writing, depending on their purpose. The structure used determines how the text is organized and can affect the meaning.

- Examples of structures used in *Maus I*:

- **Chronological structure:** The author provides the reader with chronological events.

- **Flashbacks:** An interruption in the normal sequence of events in a literary narrative; they draw attention to something that happened at an earlier time.

- Examples of structures used in poetry:

- **Stanzas:** A group of lines within a poem, often four or more lines, sometimes having a fixed length, meter or rhyming sequence.

- **Verse:** A single line of a poem, or a whole stanza (such as in a song).

- **Chorus:** A stanza in a poem or song that is repeated over the course of the song.

- **Repetition:** When authors use a word or phrase more than once, to create a pattern or for the purpose of emphasis.

**Draft a Literary Analysis:** Students will analyze a model literary analysis. Although students wrote a literary analysis in Module 1, the one they analyze differs slightly as it compares and contrasts the structures of a poem and a novel and notes how the structures contribute to the themes of the texts. After studying the model closely, students will plan and draft their own literary analysis.

- A **literary analysis** is not a summary or traditional book report. Instead, it is an expository essay where the writer closely examines aspects of a text and points out the choices an author made (in this case around how he or she structured the text) and explains their significance (how the structures contribute to the theme).

**Read Excerpts of Memoirs by Victims and Survivors of the Holocaust and Write Summary Paragraphs:** While reading these excerpts, students track the development of theme and write objective summary paragraphs. Students will participate in mini lessons and practice of language standards on verb conjugation, voice, and mood.

- Examples of **memoirs** read in class: Students read excerpts of *Night* by Elie Wiesel and *The Other Victims* by Ina R. Friedman. Both are emotional stories of persecution and terror during the Holocaust.

- Objective Summaries: Students use the same criteria as in Unit 1 to draft summaries of the memoirs they are reading. Each summary ends in a statement about the themes explored in the memoir. Example summary:

> In *Night* by Elie Wiesel, Elie faces death in a concentration camp. Elie stands in a line with his father, mother, and sister. The German soldiers separate them by gender, and Elie only has his father to help him through this. Other inmates give them advice to lie about their ages so they can be used as workers instead of being burned alive. However, the soldiers start to lead Elie’s group toward the fiery pit. Men begin to pray and Elie’s father weeps, but Elie is angry at God for allowing people to die this way. He contemplates running into the barbed wire to die quickly, rather than let the Nazis burn him alive. In the memoir excerpt Elie says, “I gathered all that remained of my strength in order to break rank and throw myself onto the barbed wire. Deep down, I was saying good-bye to my father, to the whole universe . . .” As Elie and his father are almost at the pit of flames and Elie prepares to head to the barbed wire, his group is directed past the flames to barracks and are not killed by the soldiers. This develops the theme that trauma can cause one to lose all religious faith and hope.

**  
Focus on Language Structure and Meaning:** While reading excerpts of Holocaust memoirs, students will also analyze the following elements and structures in language and consider how to use them in their own speaking and writing:

- **Gerunds and Gerund Phrases**: A gerund is formed by adding *-ing* to a verb. While gerunds look like verbs, they actually function as nouns in sentences.

- Example: <u>Writing an essay that compares and contrasts two texts</u> is required in this class.

- **Infinitive Phrases:** An infinitive is *to* + base form of verb. Infinitives can function in sentences as nouns, adjectives, or adverbs.

- Example: Our assignment is <u>to write an essay that compares and contrasts two texts</u>.

- **Verb Mood:** Verb mood refers to the speaker’s or writer’s intention and the purpose of a sentence. There are five possible verb moods in English:

- **Indicative Mood** expresses a fact, intention, desire, or belief. Most sentences are statements made using the indicative mood. Examples: I <u>will finish</u> my homework tonight, and I <u>will review</u> it tomorrow. I <u>had finished</u> my homework by 5 p.m. last night.

- **Imperative Mood** expresses commands or requests and indicates that the speaker desires for the action expressed in the sentence to take place. In imperative sentences, the subject is *you*, but it is not stated in the sentence. Examples: <u>Finish</u> your homework!

- **Conditional Mood** expresses possibility and something that can happen only if something else happens first (i.e., cause and effect) through the use of the words like *might*, *could*, and *would* before the base form of the verb. Examples: If I finished my homework, then I <u>would be able to</u> relax. I <u>could finish</u> my homework right after school if I didn’t have basketball practice.

- **Subjunctive Mood** expresses imaginary or possible outcomes, suggestions, demands, necessity, and wishes. The subjunctive is formed using the base form of a verb (e.g., *be*, *go*, *have*, *finish*). Examples: I demanded you <u>finish</u> your homework yesterday. I suggest that you <u>finish</u> your homework tonight. It is essential that I <u>finish</u> my homework tomorrow.

- **Interrogative Mood** expresses a question. Interrogative statements generally begin with an auxiliary verb (to have, to be, to do), followed by a subject and main verb. In some cases, there is a question word (*who*, *what, when*, *where*, *why*, *how*) before the auxiliary verb or in place of a subject. Examples: <u>Did</u> you <u>finish</u> your homework? What <u>did</u> he <u>finish</u>? Who <u>has finished</u> his homework?

**Commemorative Poster Share:** At the end of the unit, students choose one voice from the excerpts and memoirs they read that resonates with them. They create a commemorative poster that honors the voice. All students will then display their work on a commemorative wall and participate in a silent commemorative poster share to honor the lives of these victims and survivors.

The reading and writing skills students develop in the seven lessons in the first half of Unit 2 prepare them for the mid-unit assessment, where they will independently analyze a new poem, comparing the structure and theme in the poem to the structure and theme in the anchor text,  
*Maus I*. The work also prepares students for their end of unit assessment where they answer questions on verb conjugation, voice, and mood.

**Habits of Character:** In addition to their academic learning, the EL Education curriculum focuses on “habits of character” and social-emotional learning. With this in mind, students work on various habits of character throughout the curriculum. In this unit, working to become ethical people continues to be the character emphasized throughout the lessons as students build empathy and compassion for the individuals and groups who experience terrible oppression during the Holocaust. They also build empathy, compassion, and respect as they care for students who may feel connected to or impacted by issues presented within the text. Students will also practice working to become effective learners as they persevere through a new type of literary analysis.

How can you support your student at home?

Talk to your student about the guiding questions, particularly if any of the topics raised might be sensitive for your student or family.

Talk to your student about the texts he or she is reading in the classroom, particularly if any of the topics raised might be sensitive for your student.

Ask your students about the poems they are reading in class. Reread poems together, asking students to share their understanding of the structure and themes in each poem.

Students are reading excerpts of Holocaust memoirs in class, such as *Night* by Elie Wiesel. Consider reading the entire texts of some of the excerpts together with your student.

Reach out to teachers if you have any questions or concerns about the texts.

Talk to your student about the books you are reading, together try to determine the themes and structures in these books. Discuss how they contribute to the overall meaning of the text.

Talk to your student about the Holocaust. Discuss other examples of genocides in history and in modern day.

Ask your student to show you their literary analysis plans, and talk through the content of their writing piece. Examine the model essay and writing checklist together, and discuss your student’s progress towards the criteria.

Watch films and research on the internet with your student to find out more about victims and survivors of the Holocaust. Continue to build background knowledge on this topic by discovering together the details of this time period and its lasting effects.

Read and research ways Holocaust victims and survivors have been, and continue to be, honored. Discuss the importance of remembrance and commemorating. Why is remembering the stories of others important? How does it impact others?

Students continue to complete their independent research reading for homework, and choice reading is an optional homework component:

**  
Independent Research reading:** When not reading their anchor text, your student is expected to independently research the topic. When not assigned readings in the anchor text, your student reads topic-related books of his or her choice for approximately 20 minutes <u>each day</u> and respond to a prompt of choice in the <u>front</u> of the independent reading journal. These are usually books your student will bring home from school; however, they may be topic-related books chosen by your student at the public or your home library. Prompts for independent reading can be found in the homework materials provided.

**Choice reading:** If your student would also like to independently read and respond to a book of free choice, he or she may use the <u>back</u> of the independent reading journal. Prompts for independent reading can be found in the homework materials provided.

Independent Research Reading

**Directions:** Remember to record responses to research reading in the front of your independent reading journal and responses to choice reading in the back. Try to choose a different prompt each time.

Record any new vocabulary in your vocabulary log. Underline vocabulary found during independent reading.

**Record:**

- Date

- Title and author of your reading book

- Pages you have read

- Prompt

- Response

**Example:**

<u>Date:</u> 1/13/2020

<u>Book Title and Author</u>: *Maus I* by Art Spiegelman

Pages Read: 11–23

<u>Prompt:</u> Summarize your research reading today in no more than five sentences.

<u>Response:</u> In Chapter 1 of *Maus I*, Art, the narrator, goes to visit his father, a Holocaust survivor named Vladek. Vladek has aged after two heart attacks and his wife’s suicide, and Art wants to hear his story of the Holocaust. As Vladek pedals on his on his bicycle while talking to Art, Vladek tells Art about how he had a girlfriend before Art’s mother but decided he wanted to marry Anja after meeting her and investigating her family and eligibility. Afterwards, he asks Art not to publish these private details.

**  
Consider using the following independent reading prompts.**[^1]

- How does this text add to your understanding of one of the guiding questions of the module?

|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Definition in your own words**                  | **Synonyms** (words with the same meaning) |
| **Words with the same affix or root**             | **Sketch**                                 |
| **Translation in home language** (if appropriate) |                                            |

Vocabulary

**Directions:** In the classroom, you have been recording words from your texts in your vocabulary log. Throughout this unit, you have been research reading topic-related books at home to build your knowledge of the Holocaust and recording words in your independent reading journal.

Choose a word from your research reading or from a text you’ve read in class and add the word to your vocabulary log. Try to choose a different word to add and to practice a different vocabulary strategy each time. For each word, be sure to add the following:

1.  The definition, or meaning, of the word

<!-- -->

6.  The vocabulary strategy you used to figure out the meaning of the word

7.  A sketch or diagram that helps you to better understand the meaning of the word

Record new vocabulary in vocabulary logs and mark academic vocabulary with a symbol, for example a star:

- Academic vocabulary: words you might find in informational texts on many different topics. For example, the words *evidence* and *rationale* are words that could be found in books on any topic.

- Domain-specific vocabulary: words about a particular topic. For example, the words *tadpoles*, *frogspawn*, and *amphibian* are some that would be found on the topic of frogs.

Vocabulary Strategies

As a reminder, the vocabulary strategies we’ve been working on in class are listed below:

- Context: Read the sentence around the word.

- Look at the affixes for clues.

- Look at the root of the word for clues.

- Use a dictionary.

- Discuss the word with another person (after attempting some of the above strategies).

[^1]: Some of the prompts will not be appropriate for the text students are reading. Invite students to choose a prompt that works for the text they have just read.
