Excerpt from “*Abe’s Story*: Excerpts and Synopsis”

**Name:** **Date:**

**Note:** Ghettos were quarters Jews were forced to live in centuries before the Holocaust. The largest ghetto during the Holocaust was the Warsaw ghetto in Poland. Ghettos were used to segregate Jews from the rest of the population. They were supposed to be temporary, but Jews could be imprisoned in ghettos for days, weeks, or even years. Hundreds of thousands of people were crammed into tight spaces with little to no space to sleep, without bathroom facilities, food, or water. Thousands died of the diseases that resulted in the lack of plumbing and healthcare, or from starvation. Ghettos were destroyed in 1941 once Nazis implemented the “Final Solution,” which was the plan to murder all European Jews.

“*Abe’s Story*: Excerpts and Synopsis” by Joey Korn is about Abe’s experience in the Jewish Holocaust. This excerpt details the harsh conditions of the ghettos and Abe’s will to survive.

**The Ghettos**

Abe’s family was soon deported to the Kutno Ghetto, actually a walled-in prison. Living conditions were horrible, with only one open pit toilet and one hand water pump to serve the needs of about 2000 imprisoned Jews. Life became a daily routine of waiting in lines—for food, for water, and for use of the pit toilet. Because of the accumulated waste and sewage, which the Nazis would not even allow the prisoners to remove, a typhus epidemic plagued the ghetto, spread by the lice. Many innocent people died simply because of man’s inhumanity to man.

Even though Abe was still with his family in the ghetto, he soon understood that they would all die if he did not try to escape. Maybe he could save himself and be able to help his family from outside the ghetto walls. Abe and a friend bribed a guard to arrange the escape. The following is an excerpt from the chapter entitled “Our Final Farewell.”

Within the ghetto, four Jewish doctors had improvised a hospital, which was no hospital at all. There were no facilities, no medicine, no stethoscopes—nothing except makeshift beds and the doctors’ dedicated wills to help and to heal. Within hours, the eighteen beds quickly filled with the living, who were dying. Others had no choice but to die at “home,” and it made little difference. Still, the lines seemed endless. One either waited and waited for bread, for water, for toilet facilities . . . or waited in line to be buried. Such disaster brings out the best, the worst, and the dark humor in people. The sight shocked our teacher, Reb Mottel. Over and over and over again he would say, “You see this line for bread . . . people want to be first. You see that line of the dying and the dead . . . people want to be last!” Such was his lament.

Doom stared us in the face. Our only hope for survival was to escape—if our feet were able to carry us. But how? Some of the German guards had a spark of pity left. If we could offer some inducement to compensate them for their risk, we could possibly arrange to escape. I learned that a friend of mine, Garfingal, was planning to escape.

“Garfingal,” I said, “I would like to escape, too. Is it possible for me to go with you?”

“What do you have to offer as a bribe?” he said.

“I don’t have much. I have a wrist watch,” I said, as I struggled to think of something else. “And I have a throw rug that my sisters hooked from the remains of sugar sacks,” I said excitedly. “It’s very pretty and unusual.”

The next morning, Garfingal brought me good news. His contact would be on guard duty from midnight until 6:00 a.m. At about 4:00 a.m., I would be able to barter the watch and rug for my life. Of course, I could be bartering for death at the hands of another Nazi guard who might observe our escape. Even my friend’s contact, who agreed to blink for a price, might turn on us. There was no guarantee. I gave him the watch and the rug.

Even more trying than facing death itself was facing my parents and sisters with the news. I shall never forget my mother, sobbing and saying to me, “Son mine, Abe, listen to me! Do you think that you are any different or better than us? Don’t act in this selfish way. You should want to stay with your family and share the same fate with us. What will befall us will, with God’s will, befall you too. Don’t be selfish. Don’t desert your family.” My mother convinced almost everyone that she was right—even me.

My father had the courage to think differently and logically. After reflecting on the problem that confronted us all, he said, “Do you want Abe to stay here and die, God forbid, with us? Or would you rather he escape and live—and possibly help us later to escape and live also!” My father’s wisdom prevailed and convinced us all that escape was the right thing to do.

Without waiting for calm or normality, we immediately put our nervous energy to good use. My mother placed my one pair of underwear, a towel, a shirt, socks, and a pair of trousers into a rucksack. This was my only luggage. My father, who had been following the events silently and without participating, now reminded me to pray often, and to remember—I had somehow forgotten to take my best pair of shoes with leather soles that I had been saving. I thankfully took them from him and hurriedly placed them inside my pack.

Now my family stared into empty space with me, waiting for the zero hour—when I was to attempt my escape. My father was calm and collected, despite the tension that gripped us all. “Don’t forget to remove your Jewish star insignia from your coat,” he said. Even though they displayed our revered Star of David, these yellow badges of shame identified us easily to any German, even from a distance, as Jews to be abused.

My heart broke as the moment of departure and separation from my family neared. I ran to meet the outstretched arms of my mother. Her frail, weakened form convulsed with sobs as she embraced me and kissed me good-bye. She held on to me with a grip that expressed volumes. It said, “Go.” It said, “Stay.” It said, “How sad.” It said, “How much I love you, now and forever.” It said, “God, please watch over my son.” It said the unspeakable. It spoke of a mother’s love for her only son. My sisters cried and held on to me as if to hold on to the memory of this moment—and to life.

My father—who had always been my strength and my shield—waited until last to come over. He had a rugged face with a simple, short mustache and a head of premature gray, borne of pain. He removed his pinch spectacles, fell on my shoulder, hugged me with all his might, and then abruptly let go. “Don’t ever forget us,” he said. “Don’t ever forget who you are and what our religion teaches us. Watch yourself, and may the Eternal, who watches over all of us, mercifully protect you.” I had to summon all my strength to make my feet take me away. I was never to see my family again.

Abe and his friend successfully escaped the ghetto in the fall of 1940, but where were they to go? They walked to a nearby town, Krosniewice, which was also a Nazi ghetto for Jews. At least the Nazis allowed some freedom of movement. Abe stayed with his aunt and immediately went to work trying to help his family. He learned to deal in the black market, and he smuggled goods into the Kutno Ghetto to help his family. On one of these smuggling trips, two gendarmes caught him. They beat him terribly and left him to die. Abe’s uncle took him in. Two of Abe’s good friends helped nurse him back to health.
