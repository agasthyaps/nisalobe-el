Homework: Verb Mood and Voice: *Abe’s Story*

**Name:** **Date:**

**Directions:** Read the summary, and answer the questions that follow about verb mood and voice.

In “*Abe’s Story*: Excerpts and Synopsis” by Joey Korn, Abe and his family are imprisoned by the Nazis in a ghetto during the Jewish Holocaust. In this ghetto, 2,000 Jews live in close quarters, share one toilet, and wait in line for food and water. They die from the diseases caused by waste build up and non-existent healthcare. Abe has the chance to escape. However, if he leaves with his friend, he left his family behind. At first, his mother guilts him into staying so he may remain with his family and face the same death as his parents and sisters. However, his father convinces him to take this opportunity to escape and return to save his family if possible. Ultimately, Abe escapes but is never able to save his family. In the memoir excerpt, Abe says it was essential that he summon all his strength to make his feet take him away and “I was never to see my family again,” which continues to develop the theme “survival sometimes requires us to leave others behind.”
