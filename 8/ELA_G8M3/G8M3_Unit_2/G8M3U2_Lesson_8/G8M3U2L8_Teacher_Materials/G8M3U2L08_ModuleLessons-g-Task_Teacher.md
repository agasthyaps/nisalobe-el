In “*Abe’s Story*: Excerpts and Synopsis” by Joey Korn, Abe and his family are imprisoned by the Nazis in a ghetto during the Jewish Holocaust. In this ghetto, 2,000 Jews live in close quarters. They share one toilet, constantly wait in lines for food and water. Many die from the diseases caused by waste build up and lack of healthcare. Abe has the chance to escape with his friend but must leave his family behind. At first, his mother makes him feel guilty for leaving his family. She thinks that he should remain with his family and face the same death as his parents and sisters. However, his father convinces him to take this opportunity to escape and return to save his family if possible. Ultimately, Abe escapes but is never able to save his family. In the memoir excerpt Abe says, “I had to summon all my strength to make my feet take me away. I was never to see my family again,” which develops the theme that survival sometimes requires us to make difficult choices.
