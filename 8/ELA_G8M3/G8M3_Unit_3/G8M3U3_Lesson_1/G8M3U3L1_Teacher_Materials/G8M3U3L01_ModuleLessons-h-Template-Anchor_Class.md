**Model Text Reflection**

An upstander is a person who takes action to help others, especially people who are being bullied or threatened in some way by someone more powerful. Sanz Briz, also known as “the Angel of Budapest,” was an upstander of the Holocaust. He was a Spanish diplomat in an embassy in Hungary. As an upstander, Briz showed compassion for Hungarian Jews when he falsified their documents so they could claim Spanish citizenship. This included “232 provisional passports and 1,898 protective letters.” He knew that otherwise they were in danger of being killed. An upstander also takes action when they do not have to help people. Besides falsifying documents, Briz even rented eleven apartment buildings to hide about 5,000 Jews. Briz was known to strictly follow the law, but in this case “he put human rights before the law of the land, and was one of the first diplomats to use diplomatic immunity to protect refugees.” He broke the law to protect Hungarian Jews, even though he got no personal gain from it. Sanz Briz represents what it means to be an upstander.
