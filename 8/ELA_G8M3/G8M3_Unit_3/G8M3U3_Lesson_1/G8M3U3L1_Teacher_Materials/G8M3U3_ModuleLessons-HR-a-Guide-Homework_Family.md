![](media/image1.png) Guiding Questions and Big Ideas

How did upstanders respond, and what can we learn from their voices?

- *Even in the midst of unimaginable pain and hardship, people in the Holocaust made choices to stand up for others and themselves.*

- *There were risks involved in resisting the Nazis, hiding Jewish people, or supporting the transit of victims, but many were willing to risk the severe consequences in order to stand up for others.*

- *Through the choices they made in the Holocaust, upstanders continue to inspire people to make the world a better place.*

- *There are big and small ways to stand up for your beliefs.*

What will your student be doing at school?

Throughout this unit, your student will continue to engage in a variety of experiences that grow their understanding of the Holocaust and increase their literacy skills. As readers, students build a robust toolbox that helps them analyze, understand, and enjoy texts. Students in Grade 8 pay attention to various literary devices and components in the texts they read, and classroom instruction is aligned to support their fluency with these components. Some of these experiences and literacy components are outlined below.

- **Discuss Common Traits of Upstanders:** Students discuss the traits they saw across the texts they read in Units 1 and 2, naming common attributes of upstanders such as perseverance, bravery, compassion, and risk-taking.

- **Read Informational Accounts of Upstanders:** The bulk of the reading done in Unit 3 is made up of informational accounts of upstanders from the Holocaust. While reading these texts, students work to find key details, the central idea, and supporting evidence.

- **Informational Texts** are a category of nonfiction resources whose main purpose is to share information about the world. These texts can come in different formats such as biographies, how-to books, literary nonfiction, pamphlets, and technical texts.

- **Examples** of texts read:

<!-- -->

- “Marek Edelman Obituary” Excerpt <https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/04/secondworldwar-holocaust>

- “Oskar Schindler,” <https://www.britannica.com/biography/Oskar-Schindler>

<!-- -->

- **Write Reflections:** After reading each informational account of upstanders in the Holocaust, students write a reflection describing how these individuals took action. The criteria students used for an effective written reflection are below:

- Introduces the Holocaust upstander

- Includes at least one key character trait of an upstander

- Uses evidence from the text that demonstrates each character trait

- Wraps up with a concluding statement

- Is short, clear, and concise

- **Study Language Standards:** As students write their reflections, they learn more about how to use punctuation such as commas, ellipses, and dashes effectively.

- **Create a Graphic Panel:** Students create graphic panels as a representation of one of the reflections they wrote. This will show a significant moment in the upstander’s life. In Unit 1, students read the graphic novel *Maus I*, which was constructed of graphic panels. Going back to this format as a representation for their reflections will give them practice in this format, which they will use again in the performance task.

- **Write a Narrative:** For their end of unit assessment, students write a narrative. Although students wrote a narrative in Module 1, the narrative written in this module will have a different structure. Like the anchor text, which was structured as an interview between father and son and included reflection as a means to tell about an important event, the narrative students write will be a series of questions and answers in interview format between a fictional upstander students create and themselves as the interviewee.

- **Narrative:** Plainly, a narrative is a story. It is a written account of connected events.

- **Model:** Prior to writing their narrative, students closely examine a model to understand the structure, components, and criteria of a narrative in interview form.

- **Create Upstander:** Students spend time creating an imaginary upstander that could have lived during the Holocaust.

- **Plan a Narrative:** In class, students plan their upstander’s answers to the interview questions based on their imagined, but realistic life experiences. Students focus on the following writing techniques in the responses they write:

<!-- -->

- Adding sensory details

- Using pacing

- Embedding reflection

- Including precise, relevant and descriptive details

<!-- -->

- **Performance Task:** For the culminating performance task, students create graphic panels that will visually represent elements of their narrative. The task also has a reflection component, where students share their thinking on why they picked the particular moment to display in a panel, and a reflection on the process of creating the panel. In lessons leading up to the performance task, students plan their panel and reflection, draft these elements, and prepare to present. For the actual presentation, students share their graphic panels with an audience and answer questions about their work.

The reading and writing skills students develop in the first four lessons in Unit 3 prepare them for the mid-unit assessment, where they will be presented with a reflection paragraph and will answer selected and constructed response questions about the use of punctuation and verb voice and mood. This and later work also prepares students for their end of unit assessment where they draft their narrative interview.

- **Habits of Character:** In addition to their academic learning, the EL Education curriculum focuses on “habits of character” and social-emotional learning. With this in mind, students work on various habits of character throughout the curriculum:

- Work to Becoming Effective Learners—developing mindsets and skills for success in college, career, and life (e.g., initiative, responsibility, perseverance, collaboration)

- Work to Become Ethical People—treating others well and standing up for what is right (e.g., empathy, integrity, respect, compassion)

- Work to Contribute to a Better World—putting their learning to use to improve communities (e.g., citizenship, service).

In this unit, students work to become ethical people as they build empathy and compassion for the individuals and groups who experienced terrible oppression during the Holocaust. These are the specific skills students focus on:

- I show empathy:

  - This means I understand and share or take into account the feelings, situation, or attitude of others.

  - Students build empathy and compassion as they show respect and care for students who may feel connected to or impacted by issues presented within the text.

- I show respect:

  - This means I appreciate the abilities, qualities, and achievements of others and treat myself, others, and the environment with care.

  - These are incredibly emotional texts that may evoke strong responses, and students need to practice respect for the emotions of both others and themselves.

  - Students practice respect and empathy when they discuss this complex topic with their peers.

- I show compassion:

  - This means I notice when others are sad or upset and try to help them.

  - Students also work to contribute to a better world by putting their learning to use to improve communities as they share their performance task. Students share their graphic panels, presenting their upstander’s experience and reflecting on the qualities of upstanders.

How can you support your student at home?

Talk to your student about the guiding questions, particularly if any of the topics raised might be sensitive for your student or family.

Talk to your student about the texts he or she is reading in the classroom, particularly if any of the topics raised might be sensitive for your student.

Read additional informational accounts of upstanders with your student, and discuss. What important events did you learn about? How did these events impact the individuals? How do these connect to the texts students have read in class?

Reach out to teachers if you have any questions or concerns about the text.

Discuss traits of upstanders with your student. Together, find examples of upstanders in your community, or in other periods of history.

Find, listen to and discuss interviews that share information about upstanders from other aspects of your life or of history that is of interest to you (e.g., upstanders in sports, upstanders in politics).

Read and research ways Holocaust victims and survivors have been, and continue to be, honored. Discuss the importance of remembrance and commemorating. Why is remembering the stories of others important? How does it impact others?

Unit 3: Homework

Students continue to complete their independent research reading for homework and work on various narrative writing tasks that relate to their Create an Upstander Narrative Interview.

**Independent Research reading:** When not reading their anchor text, your student is expected to independently research the topic. When not assigned readings in the anchor text, student read topic-related books of his or her choice for approximately 20 minutes <u>each day</u> and respond to a prompt of choice in the <u>front</u> of the independent reading journal. These are usually books your student will bring home from school; however, they may be topic-related books chosen by your student at the public or your home library. Prompts for independent reading can be found in the homework materials provided.

**Choice reading:** If your student would also like to independently read and respond to a book of free choice, he or she may use the <u>back</u> of the independent reading journal. Prompts for independent reading can be found in the homework materials provided.

Independent Research Reading

**Directions:** Remember to record responses to research reading in the front of your independent reading journal and responses to choice reading in the back. Try to choose a different prompt each time.

Record any new vocabulary in your vocabulary log. Underline vocabulary found during independent reading.

**Record:**

- Date

- Title and author of your reading book

- Pages you have read

- Prompt

- Response

**Example:**

<u>Date:</u> 1/13/2020

<u>Book Title and Author:</u> *Maus I* by Art Spiegelman

<u>Pages Read:</u> 11–23

<u>Prompt:</u> Summarize your research reading today in no more than five sentences.

<u>Response:</u> In Chapter 1 of *Maus I*, Art, the narrator, goes to visit his father, a Holocaust survivor named Vladek. Vladek has aged after two heart attacks and his wife’s suicide, and Art wants to hear his story of the Holocaust. As Vladek pedals on his on his bicycle while talking to Art, Vladek tells Art about how he had a girlfriend before Art’s mother but decided he wanted to marry Anja after meeting her and investigating her family and eligibility. Afterwards, he asks Art not to publish these private details.

Consider using the following independent reading prompts.[^1]

- How does this text add to your understanding of one of the guiding questions of the module?

- Which habits of character are demonstrated in the text? Explain.

- What is the central idea or theme of the text? How was this idea developed?

- Record two or three facts in your own words that you learned from the text.

- Summarize your research reading today in no more than five sentences.

- What major ideas are present in the text you read? Give text details that convey those details.

- What questions do you have about the topic after reading?

- Choose one new word from your reading today and analyze it on a vocabulary square.

|                                                   |                                            |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Definition in your own words**                  | **Synonyms** (words with the same meaning) |
| **Words with the same affix or root**             | **Sketch**                                 |
| **Translation in home language** (if appropriate) |                                            |

Vocabulary

**Directions:** In the classroom, you have been recording words from your texts in your vocabulary log. Throughout this unit, you have been research reading topic-related books at home to build your knowledge of the Holocaust and recording words in your independent reading journal.

Choose a word from your research reading or from a text you’ve read in class and add the word to your vocabulary log. Try to choose a different word to add and to practice a different vocabulary strategy each time. For each word, be sure to add the following:

1.  The definition, or meaning, of the word

2.  The vocabulary strategy you used to figure out the meaning of the word

3.  A sketch or diagram that helps you to better understand the meaning of the word

Record new vocabulary in vocabulary logs and mark academic vocabulary with a symbol, for example a star:

- Academic vocabulary: words you might find in informational texts on many different topics. For example, the words *evidence* and *rationale* are words that could be found in books on any topic.

- Domain-specific vocabulary: words about a particular topic. For example, the words *tadpoles*, *frogspawn*, and *amphibian* are some that would be found on the topic of frogs.

Vocabulary Strategies

As a reminder, the vocabulary strategies we’ve been working on in class are listed below:

- Context: Read the sentence around the word.

- Look at the affixes for clues.

- Look at the root of the word for clues.

- Use a dictionary.

- Discuss the word with another person (after attempting some of the above strategies).

[^1]: Some of the prompts will not be appropriate for the text students are reading. Invite students to choose a prompt that works for the text they have just read.
