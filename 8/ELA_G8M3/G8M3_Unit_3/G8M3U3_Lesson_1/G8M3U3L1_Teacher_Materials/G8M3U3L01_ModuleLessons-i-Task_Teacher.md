- Wraps up with a concluding statement

- Is short, clear, and concise

An upstander is a person who takes action to help others, especially people who are being persecuted or threatened in some way by someone more powerful. Johtje and Aart Vos were upstanders during the Holocaust. One characteristic they showed as they helped others was compassion when they sheltered Jews in their home in Amsterdam. They showed compassion toward strangers and kept them safe. Even when there was not enough food for all of them in the house, the Voses felt a moral obligation to help people. Johtje Vos later said, “‘We couldn’t do differently than say yes.” They did not see their work as a choice, but as a duty. Taking risks is another important characteristic of an upstander because it takes courage to sacrifice your own safety to save others. Often Johtje and Aart Vos hid as many as 14 people at a time, and the Nazis frequently raided their house. Johtje and Aarte “never regretted the decision—though it placed their lives and the lives of their children at risk.” The Vos family could have been caught, but they had the courage to keep on hiding people and smuggling them to safety. The Vos’ work helps us understand what it takes to be an upstander.
