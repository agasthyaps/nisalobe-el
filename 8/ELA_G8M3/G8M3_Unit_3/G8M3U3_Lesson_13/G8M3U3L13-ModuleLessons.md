Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- SL.8.5 – Work Time A: Students plan the sequence of information from their narrative to illustrate in their graphic panels.

- SL.8.5 – Work Time B: Students use their plans to create their graphic panels.

- W.8.3 – Work Time A: Students create their graphic panels based on their narrative interviews.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Students may spend more time offering constructive feedback to their partner on their narrative interviews. Students may spend additional time using peer feedback to improve their narratives.

- Invite students to think back to *Maus I* to write a new narrative in which Art interviews his father. While this occurs within the text, students can use the narrative interview format they have been working with to reimagine the interactions between father and son to review Vladek’s key experiences.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students began planning their graphic panels that illustrate their narrative interviews. In this lesson, students will finish planning, then create their graphic panels, as well as participate in peer feedback to revise their visual.

Support All Students

- Peer feedback requires strong empathy and growth mindset. For Closing and Assessment A, consider preselecting student partnerships to strategically group students who can be supportive of one another both in skills and in confidence and kindness and provide supportive partners for students who might struggle with the task. Model a kind and constructive critique or have a pair of students model this. Continually ground students in the ideas of working to become ethical people. ▲

- Some students may need support with planning the techniques used in a graphic novel. Invite students to refer to the anchor text for examples.

- To support ELLs, this lesson builds upon the planning students began in the previous lesson. Students will continue mapping out the design of their graphic panels and then move on to creating the panels. In Closing and Assessment A of the lesson, students will review each other’s graphic panels and provide supportive feedback. Throughout the lesson, familiar repeated routines and anchor charts are integrated to help students carry out these tasks.

- ELLs may find it challenging to design and create their graphic panels, particularly if they are not experienced with visual arts. Be mindful that some students may be more enthusiastic and confident than others in carrying out this task, and pair students with supportive peers to reduce anxieties during the peer feedback exchange portion of the lesson and during Think-Pair-Share discussion in Work Times.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.A.1, 8.I.A.2, and 8.I.A.3.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Graphic Panels Sequence planner from Work Time A to ensure students are prepared to create graphic panels that illustrate a moment in their narrative in Work Time B.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will write a reflection on their graphic panels. Students will also create prompt cards for their reflection speaking points for their performance task presentation.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 13.

- Ensure there is a copy of Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 13 at each student’s workspace.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous modules to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – SL.8.5 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 13**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Plan Graphic Panels – SL.8.5 (10 minutes)

- Instruct students to retrieve their **Graphic Panels Sequence planner** and their **Narrative Interview Drafts**.

- Tell students that they are now going to finishing planning their graphic panels from the previous lesson. Remind students that the prompts in the planner will help them determine the images, descriptions, thought bubbles, and speech bubbles they use when they create the panels.

- Instruct students to continue planning their graphic panels. Refer students to the **Model Graphic Panels Sequence planner** for guidance.

- Circulate to support students as they plan. Invite those students who need to sketch out their sequence to do so. Look out for students who struggle with sequence so their graphic panels depict a clear moment from their narrative.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

B. Create Graphic Panels – SL.8.5 (20 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can create graphic panels that illustrate a moment in my narrative.”

- Display **Model Graphic Panels**. Review how each panel sequences the beginning of the explode the moment with Anna remembering the incident and uses images and text to describe the incident.

- Explain to students that they will now use their Graphic Panels Sequence planner to create their own graphic panels.

- Distribute the **Graphic Panels Template**.

- Remind students to refer to the Model Graphic Panels to make sure their graphic panels contain similar techniques. Students may also refer to *Maus I*.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Closing and Assessment

A. Peer Feedback – W.8.5 (10 minutes)

- Refocus the class.

- Organize students into pairs. Instruct students to exchange graphic panels with their partner.

- Explain to students that they will read their partner’s graphic panels and give each other feedback on how their visual successfully conveys their exploded moment and how they can improve their graphic panels to better convey their story.

- Display the following prompts, and remind students to refrain from simply stating what they like and dislike, but to give meaningful feedback:

- “The drawings in your graphic panels do a good job of showing . . . ”

- “I like the way you told the story using . . . ”

- “The think bubble helped me understand the thoughts of . . . ”

- “I think you can improve your drawings by . . . ”

- “You can make your descriptions clearer if . . . ”

- Focus students on the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**, and remind them specifically of respect and compassion. Remind students that the purpose of peer feedback is to help the other student improve his or her work, so when providing feedback, be careful to act with respect and compassion.

- Instruct students to begin.

- Circulate to support students as they work together to give feedback to one another.

- Invite students to Think-Pair-Share while prompting them with the following questions:

“How will you address this feedback? Can you share specific strategies you have for revising this work?” (Answers will vary.)

“What questions do you have about the feedback you received?” (Answers will vary.)

- Clarify any feedback for students, and invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time. As time permits, invite students to revise their graphic panels using the peer feedback they received in this lesson.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- Invite students to generate two stars and two steps for their partner. To maximize feedback, have students work in small groups of three or four, rather than pairs, to provide an opportunity for students to receive feedback from more than one person. This will also give students the opportunity to see multiple examples of the product, which will help to inform students’ own work, as well.

For Heavier Support

- While students interact during the peer feedback exchange, jot down examples of effective communication. Also jot down one or two common language errors (pervasive, stigmatizing, critical). Share each of these with the class, allowing students to take pride in the effective communication and correct the errors. (It’s not necessary to identify who communicated well or who made errors. However, pull the student aside to make it clear.) This will help students as they prepare for the performance task and their graphic panel presentations in the final lesson on this unit.

Homework

A. Revisions

- Students revise their graphic panels using the peer feedback they received in this lesson.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
