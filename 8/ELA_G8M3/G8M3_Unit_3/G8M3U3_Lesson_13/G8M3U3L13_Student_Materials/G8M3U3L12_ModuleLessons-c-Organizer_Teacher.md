Model Graphic Panels Sequence Planner

SL.8.5

**Directions:** Use the following planner to determine how you will illustrate your interview narrative. Read each prompt carefully to guide your planning.

Excerpt from my narrative that I will explode on graphic panels:

I remember it so well. It was a beautiful spring day in 1942 in Amsterdam. I was studying to be a teacher, and I had so much work to do that night that I knew I wouldn’t have time to make dinner. So I decided to stop at the local Jewish bakery for a loaf of fresh-baked rye bread. The baker always made such wonderful bread—the whole neighborhood loved to stop by.

As I turned the corner, I heard shouts and scuffling. At first I couldn’t tell what was going on, but suddenly I realized that my friend the baker was surrounded by two or three German soldiers. They were dragging him out of his bakery. For that instant, time stood still. Horrified, I watched the soldiers muscle him into a military truck and drive away. As the siren’s scream filled the air, I could just barely hear beneath that sound the muffled screams of the baker—and then they were gone. The door to the bakery stood ajar, the baker’s apron hanging there on a hook as if the baker had just stepped out for a moment to buy butter. But a dreadful emptiness filled the place. I never saw him again.

Why I selected this portion:

In the interview, Anna Jensen describes the scene I drew very vividly. This is one incident, but it represents the countless tragic experiences of many Jewish people during the Holocaust. I felt that capturing this incident in visual format would help us to remember the injustices and horrors done to Jewish people in the Holocaust.
