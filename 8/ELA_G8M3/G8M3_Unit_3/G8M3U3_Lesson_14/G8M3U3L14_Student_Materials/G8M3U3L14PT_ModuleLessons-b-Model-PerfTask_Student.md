<td colspan="3">In the interview, Anna Jensen describes the scene I drew very vividly. This is one incident, but it represents the countless tragic experiences of many Jewish people during the Holocaust. I felt that capturing this incident in visual format would help us to remember the injustices and horrors done to Jewish people in the Holocaust. I wanted viewers to feel the dark and somber tone of this moment, so I used only dark pencil. I also wanted viewers to understand Anna’s distress, so I showed drew her upset facial expression and included a thought bubble with her words, “Dear God, no.” For those not familiar with Holocaust, they can learn about the kinds of things that were done to Jewish people. Like the baker in my narrative, many people were taken from their homes and everyday lives by the Nazis to meet their death. We have to remember that this happened so that it never happens again. The visual representation brings the story to life in a new way and will hopefully help people to learn from these events, to have empathy for people like Anna who survived, and to honor those who did not.</td>
