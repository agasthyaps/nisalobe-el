Read the following questions from the Upstander Model: “Interview with Anna Jensen” narrative.

How was your life impacted by the Holocaust?

What did you do in the face of great oppression and why?

- How were you an upstander?

- What led you to this work/action?

- Can you describe a particular moment that affected you or your work a great deal?

- How did you react in this moment?

- What was the outcome of this impact?

What would be your message to future generations, such as my own?

How can I be an upstander in my own life?

How will answering these questions, from your upstander’s perspective, help you tell their important story?

Students should recognize that these questions will uncover how their upstander acted as an upstander, and they will also allow one significant moment to be described in detail, as well as uncover the lasting messages their upstander has for future generations.

Are there any other questions you would like to ask your upstander?

Students may propose additional questions, but should answer all of the questions listed above.
