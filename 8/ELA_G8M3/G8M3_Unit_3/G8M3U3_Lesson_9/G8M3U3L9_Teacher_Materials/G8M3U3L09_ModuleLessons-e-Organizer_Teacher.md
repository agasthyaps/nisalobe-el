Upstander Profile: Interview Planner

W.8.3a, W.8.4

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** You will be writing a narrative interview to describe your upstander’s experiences in the Holocaust, focusing on one particular moment where he or she made a conscious decision to take action.

**The format of the narrative will be similar to the one in the model you analyzed.** You will write a series of questions and answers, in interview style, between yourself and your upstander. Please use this planner to organize your ideas and determine aspects of your upstander’s experience.

You should be prepared to answer all of the following questions about your upstander. You may also choose to go deeper with one of the questions, or propose a follow-up question if you would like.

1.  **Think:**

- How would your upstander have responded?

- What details will you include to make your upstander’s experience come alive?

2.  **Plan:**

- Use the space below to plan how your upstander would respond to each of the questions listed above.

- Consider planning a follow-up response to some of the questions.
