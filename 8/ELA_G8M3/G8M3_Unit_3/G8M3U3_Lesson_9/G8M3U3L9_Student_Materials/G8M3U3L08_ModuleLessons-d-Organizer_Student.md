Upstander Profile Graphic Organizer

W.8.3a, W.8.4

**Name:** **Date:**

You will be writing a narrative interview to describe your upstander’s experiences in the Holocaust, focusing on one particular moment where he or she made a conscious decision to take action.

The format of the narrative will be similar to the one in the model you analyzed. You will write a series of questions and answers, in interview style, between yourself (the interviewer) and your upstander (the interviewee).

Use this planner to organize your ideas and determine aspects of your upstander’s experience.

1.  Upstander Name:

2.  Where does the interview take place?

3.  What is the age of your upstander now (at the time of interview) and during the Holocaust?

4.  Where is your upstander from? (Be specific about country, city, etc.)

5.  What was your upstander’s life like before the Holocaust?

6.  How was your upstander involved in the Holocaust?

7.  What is the <u>one</u> specific event you will expand on in your narrative? Describe, briefly, how it propelled your upstander to act.

8.  How did he or she react or respond when faced with challenges during the Holocaust?

9.  What defines your character as an upstander (use the class criteria for reference)?

10. Who is your upstander modelled after? (List any upstanders we studied whose lives influenced the creation of your fictional upstander.)

11. Are there any additional questions you would like to capture?
