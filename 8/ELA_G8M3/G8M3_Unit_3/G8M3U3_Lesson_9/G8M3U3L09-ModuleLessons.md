Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.8.3b – Work Time A: Students identify places in the model narrative interview where the writer used pacing and dialogue to develop experiences, events, and/or characters.

- W.8.3d – Work Time A: Students identify places in the model narrative interview where the writer used sensory language to capture the action and convey experiences and events.

- W.8.3 – Work Time B: Students plan their fictional upstander’s responses to a set of interview questions, establishing a context and point of view and introducing the main character.

- W.8.5 – Closing and Assessment A: Students strengthen writing by working with a partner to identify criteria that need further development and acknowledge areas of strength.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become ethical people, showing respect as they discuss the experiences of Holocaust victims and survivors while brainstorming their own upstander’s answers to interview questions. They also focus on working to become effective learners, persevering as they practice narrative writing techniques.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- In Work Time B, students may add complexity in the profile of their Holocaust Upstander to reveal more details about their upstander’s life and interaction with significant events, people, and places of the Holocaust by developing additional questions for their narrative interview.

- Students can revisit important language concepts and conventions they have worked with throughout the module (e.g., gerunds and infinitives, verb voice and mood) and look for ways to apply their learning to their writing by combining sentences and using verb voice and mood to achieve particular effects.

- Consider printing out or listening to interviews of important historical figures or Holocaust survivors, so as students read transcripts of these conversations, they can deepen their understanding of what they need to include in their own interview write-up.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students imagined and planned the character and setting of their fictional upstander. In this lesson, they will build on this foundation, answering questions from their upstander’s perspective.

Support All Students

- In the second half of this unit, students will write about a fictional rather than real upstander due to the potential danger of telling a story about a real person that isn’t true. Guide students to consider the real upstander stories they have read, and what those people experienced, as they write fictional upstander narratives.

- Emphasize the importance of students being respectful to the real stories of upstanders and what Holocaust victims went through as they write their stories. Remind students that, while narrative writing is creative and can be fun, the time period they are writing about was horrific for the victims.

- Presenting learning targets and directions in writing, orally, and if possible, accompanied by symbols will help students to understand the language within them. ▲

- Record, or have students record, share-outs visually to reinforce oral discussion of important aspects of creating a fictional upstander. ▲

- Note there is a differentiated version of Narrative Writing Practice: Pacing, Dialogue, and Sensory Details note-catcher used in Work Time A in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Students may need additional support with putting their ideas into writing. Sit with those students who require additional support with writing to help them actualize their ideas. ▲

- Refer to the Characteristics of Upstanders anchor chart, and direct students back to specific attributes they can develop in their upstander. ▲

- Provide opportunities for students to orally rehearse aspects of their fictional upstander’s character as a way to help students process information from texts they have read prior to filling out their Upstander Profile: Interview Planner. ▲

- Continue to refer students back to the Narrative Writing checklist to support students in understanding the criteria and developing a plan for their writing that meets the criteria. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson builds upon work in previous lessons with analyzing the model narrative and developing an upstander profile and biography. Students will review the model narrative again for pacing and sensory details and then apply their learning to planning the interview answers in their own historical narratives. At the end of the lesson, students will use the Narrative Writing checklist to provide peer feedback on the planning.

- ELLs may find it difficult to identify specific elements of the interview answers they have planned that meet the criteria on the Narrative Writing checklist. Encourage students to provide examples for each from their work to ensure that each is being met. Pair students strategically to build support for students, including using home language groups to allow for rich discussion about upstander characteristics and specific pacing and sensory details.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.A.2, 8.I.A.4, and 8.II.B.5.

Assessment Guidance

- Throughout Work Time B, frequently review student work to ensure they are filling out their Upstander Profile: Interview Planner with adequate and accurate details. Use common issues as whole group teaching points.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue to analyze the model and plan their narrative interviews, focusing on the narrative techniques of reflection and relevant, precise, and descriptive details. They will use their plan to draft their essays in Lesson 11.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.8.3 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 9**. Prompt students to Turn and Talk about their answers to the entrance ticket. Cold-call students to share out, and refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 9 (answers for teacher reference)**, as needed. Clarify, for students, that they will use all of the questions mentioned in their narrative interview.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Analyze a Model: Pacing, Dialogue, and Sensory Details – W.8.3b (15 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can use pacing, sensory images, and dialogue to appeal to the senses, capture the action, and help my reader understand the experiences of my upstander.”

- Prompt students to retrieve their **Upstander Model: “Interview with Anna Jensen,”** and direct them to the first question. Read aloud both the question and follow-up question as well as the responses for question 1, as students follow along silently. Explain to students that one technique authors use in narrative writing to impact the pacing of the story is to include sensory details. Explain that sensory details are details that involve the senses: speaking, hearing, seeing, touching and tasting. Review with students the meaning of pacing in this context (slowing down or speeding up the action in a narrative at certain points for an effect).

- Display and distribute the **Narrative Writing Practice: Pacing, Dialogue, and Sensory Details note-catcher**. For ELLs and students who require additional support, **Narrative Writing Practice: Pacing, Dialogue, and Sensory Details note-catcher** ▲ can be used to help guide students’ thinking with matching. Show students how it is structured. Invite students to underline examples of sensory details in Anna’s response to question 1 and the follow-up question.

- Invite students to Turn and Talk:

“What sensory details did you notice in Anna’s answer to question 1?” (Anna sees the baker was surrounded by two German soldiers with swastikas stitched on their uniforms; Anna hears shouts and scuffling, herself saying “Dear God, no.”)

“What do you notice about the amount of sensory details Anna uses in her initial response, and the amount she uses in the follow-up question?” (At first, Anna uses only a few sensory details, but when she is asked a follow-up question, she adds a lot more sensory details.)

“What effect does this increase in sensory details have on the pacing of the story?” (The first response to question one gives a broad context of the day, the places and the people involved. It sets the scene and leads into the moment. In the follow-up response, the time slows down and just describes one small moment. The level of description increases so the reader can sense what Anna is seeing, thinking, hearing, and feeling during this time.)

- Ensure that students understand that the moment Anna describes in her response is a critical moment in her life, so the writer slowed down this event and then used sensory details and very precise, specific language, including a bit of dialogue, to make it come alive more vividly. At other parts in the interview, the pace will go back to normal, or even speed up, but here, slowing down is an effective tool to help the reader connect to an important event in the narrative. Remind students that the narrative technique of slowing down the action so the writer can give precise, sensory details and description and dialogue can also be called “exploding the moment.”

- Model completing part of the first row of the note-catcher by sharing the first answer in each column and asking students if they have any questions about what to track in the Narrative Writing Practice: Pacing, Dialogue, and Sensory Details note-catcher. Prompt students to reread both parts of question 1 in the model, and then complete question 2 of the note-catcher with a partner, tracking the sensory details they underlined and looking for any additional sensory images the writer creates by using these sensory details.

- To review their partner work, ask students to Think-Pair-Share with a different partner:

“What is Anna seeing in this moment?” (She sees the baker being torn away by soldiers, the apron left hanging, and the empty bakery.)

“What is Anna hearing in this moment?” (She hears scuffling, screams, sirens, and herself saying “Dear God, no.”)

“How would the narrative be different if the sensory details were not included?” (The details make the scene more vivid and real. They help the reader picture the experience and connect with the gravity of it. Without the dialogue, we would not know Anna’s feeling about what she is seeing and hearing.)

- Use a total participation technique, and collect responses from the group. Tell students that writers often describe the feelings of a character to help the reader connect to an experience or a character. Using small bits of dialogue and describing what the character feels, sees, hears, touches, smells, or tastes are ways to deepen the reader’s engagement and understanding of the character’s experience in the narrative.

- Invite students to practice this skill by revising the sentence in question 3 of their Narrative Writing Practice: Pacing, Dialogue, and Sensory Details note-catcher. Encourage students to add sensory details and description to this sentence to engage the reader. As appropriate, point out the similarity between the techniques they are using in these revisions and the exploded moment they created in the graphic panels in Lesson 6.

- As time permits, call on students to share out their revised sentence and highlight effective examples of including sensory details.

- Review the responses, and make sure students understand the importance of using sensory details when exploding a moment. Explain to students that so much is embedded into one interview response because the writer slowed time down, added sensory details and included a small amount of dialogue. Tell students that they will have more practice exploding a moment in Lesson 10, when they practice for their narrative.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from the model narrative to explore how the writer uses reflection and details to engage the reader (W.8.3). Consider providing ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Invite students who need lighter support to predict some of the questions that the Language Dive may ask. This will improve students’ metacognition and challenge their awareness of the most interesting or meaningful elements of the sentence. Students may also choose to carry out one of the following:

- Paraphrase the sentence using your own words.

- Underline all pronouns, check all nouns, circle all verbs, and star all adjectives. What words do you have left? What is the function of these words?

For Heavier Support

- Invite students who need heavier support to use Narrative Writing Practice: Pacing, Dialogue, and Sensory Details note-catcher ▲. This resource has matching items to help guide students’ thinking.

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from the model narrative to explore how the writer uses reflection and details to engage the reader (W.8.3). Consider providing ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Encourage students who need heavier support to independently reflect on this sentence and its meaning before the next lesson. Students may also choose to carry out one of the following:

- Make a guess about what the chunks of the sentence might be.

- Use a dictionary to look up the word *stitched* and select the best definition for the word as it is used in this sentence.

Work Time

B. Plan a Narrative: Upstander Interview Answers – W.8.3 (20 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can use pacing, sensory images, and dialogue to appeal to the senses, capture the action, and help my reader understand the experiences and events of my upstander.”

- Display and distribute the **Upstander Profile: Interview planner**. Explain to students that they will use this planner to create interview question responses from their upstander’s perspective. Explain that is fine to reword the questions if desired, but the general content should remain similar. Read the questions aloud, or prompt partners to read them together.

- Prompt students to refer to their **Upstander Profile graphic organizer**, and reread what they have already planned to recall details and aspects of their upstander’s character.

- Direct students brainstorm with a partner:

“What do you already know about your upstander that you will want to embed into the answers to these questions?” (Answers will vary)

“Now that you have seen the interview questions, do you think there are aspects of your character that you still need to develop or revise?” (Answers will vary)

- Allow partners to orally process the questions, thinking about how their upstander would answer the questions prior to planning their responses on the Upstander Profile: Interview planner.

- Invite students to fill out the Upstander Profile: Interview planner independently. Circulate, and pull small groups as needed. Refer students back to the model for examples of an upstander’s response. Refer to the **Upstander Profile: Interview planner (example for teacher reference)** and the **Upstander Profile graphic organizer (example for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Closing and Assessment

A. Narrative Writing Checklist: Progress Check-In – W.8.3 (5 minutes)

- Invite students to retrieve their **Narrative Writing checklist** and find a new partner. Read the descriptors of criteria below aloud as students read along silently. Prompt students to put a star next to each criterion on their Narrative Writing checklist.

- “W.8.3a: I introduce a narrator and/or characters and establish a point of view.”

- “I develop experiences, events and characters using techniques such as dialogue, pacing, description, and reflection. “

- “W.8.3d, W.8.4: I use descriptive details, sensory language, and precisely chosen words to capture the action and convey experiences and events.”

- Invite students to reread each descriptor identified with a star with their partner, pausing after each one to identify how they are addressing this criterion in their narrative plan so far, or noting if it needs further development. Direct students to capture notes on their checklist where they need to further develop their plan to meet the criterion.

- Prompt partners to Turn and Talk, sharing the progress they have made on their narrative plan, and identifying the area they would most like to develop in their narrative.

- As time permits, invite students to revise their Upstander Profile: Interview Planner, focusing on adding sensory details, dialogue, and description to their plan.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Refine Interview Planner

- Students revise their Upstander Profile: Interview planner, focusing on adding sensory details, dialogue, and description to their plan.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
