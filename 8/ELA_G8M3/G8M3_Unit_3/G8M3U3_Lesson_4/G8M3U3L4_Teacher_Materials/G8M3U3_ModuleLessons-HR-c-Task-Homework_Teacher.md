Homework: Punctuation and Verb Voice  
and Mood: Text Reflection

(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Imagine that a classmate of yours has recently written a text reflection of “Marek Edelman Obituary” Excerpt. Read the text reflection below, and answer the questions that follow.

Leading others to do what is right is a characteristic of an upstander. Marek Edelman was one of the leaders of the Warsaw uprising of 1943. He helped organize resistors to rebel against the Nazis who imprisoned the Jews in the Warsaw ghetto. For three weeks, the battle would continue and the Nazis will defeat them. The Nazis stripped them of their civil rights dignity and freedom. The Warsaw ghetto housed half a million Jews. It originally had resources like education and healthcare. Edelman knew they did not have the arms to defeat the Nazis, but he chose to lead an effort to protect his people from persecution and to take power away from the Nazis. On January 18, 1943, Edelman and other resistors disguised themselves as deportees, then fire was opened on the Nazis by them. Although they did not have enough weapons, supplies or rebels to beat the Nazis, they were willing to die fighting rather than allow the Nazis to have power over their fate. “‘We fought to protect the people in the ghetto, to extend their life by a day or two,’ said Edelman.” As the Nazis deported Jews from the Warsaw ghetto, everyone knew they were being taken to death camps to be executed. Many chose to be martyrs and not resist. Edelman’s approach was to act on behalf of his people. It took the Germans weeks to finally end the rebellion. “In later years he joined the Solidarity movement and, while his career as a politician in post-Soviet Poland never quite took off, he remained sought after as a living symbol of wartime resistance, a hero to Jews as much as to Polish nationalists.” Edelman was one of the few survivors of the uprising, but he led the resistance prepared to die. Marek Edelman’s leadership demonstrates how a strong upstander can influence others to be upstanders too.
