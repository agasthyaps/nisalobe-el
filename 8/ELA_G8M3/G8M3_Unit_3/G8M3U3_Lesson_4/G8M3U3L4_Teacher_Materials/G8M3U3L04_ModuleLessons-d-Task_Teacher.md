An upstander is a person who takes action to help others who are being persecuted by someone more powerful. One of the characteristics of an upstander is integrity. Miep Gies was a woman of integrity who felt a moral obligation to keep Anne Frank and her family safe from Nazi persecution. Gies’ employer, Otto Frank, asked her to hide his family and three friends. She did not hesitate to help out. She believed “It is our human duty to help those who are in trouble.” As a non-Jewish person, Miep could have decided not to help the Franks because of the risks she would have to take. Taking risks when one does not have to is another characteristic of an upstander. Miep was not a target of the Nazi Party and did not receive any personal gain from this selfless work. After the Frank family was captured by the Nazis, she tried to bribe an officer to release them. “Miep even went to Nazi headquarters to negotiate a deal, fully aware that this bold move could cost her life.” Although she could not save the Franks from imprisonment, she was able to retrieve Anne Frank’s notebooks. Because of Miep Gies’ integrity and the risks she took to protect the Frank family, the world knows about Anne Frank.
