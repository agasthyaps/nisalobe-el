Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Work Time A – End of Unit 3 Assessment: Write a Narrative in Interview Form: Students are assessed on their ability to develop the narrative that they have been preparing for and planning over the course of Lessons 7–10 of Module 3, Unit 3. (W.8.3, W.8.4, W.8.6, W.8.10, L.8.1, L.8.2)

- W.8.3 – Closing and Assessment A: Reflecting on learning using the Track Progress: Narrative Writing recording form. This exercise is meant to provide students time to formally keep track of and reflect on their own learning. This self-reflection supports metacognition, responsibility, and pride in work and learning.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Ask students to create goals for their end of unit assessment. How might they improve their narrative in the next lesson?

- Have students write an additional narrative independently to continue to practice the skills that have been scaffolded in this unit.

- Have students add additional questions to their narratives if they have extra time.

- Invite students to imagine a conversation between two upstanders and to write a new narrative in which these two figures interact and discuss and compare their experiences. Students can consider how this dialogue would differ from the interview format they have used to write their narratives.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Throughout this unit, students have studied upstanders of the Holocaust and reflected on texts about their experiences. They have also analyzed a model narrative interview with an upstander and have prepared to write their own by identifying characteristics of an upstander, creating a fictional upstander based on the ones they studied, preparing questions and answers for their narrative interview, and planning the pacing by exploding the moments of their narratives. In this lesson, students will utilize these skills when they write the narrative interview for the end of unit assessment.

Support All Students

- Guide students to consider the real upstander stories they have read, and what those people experienced, as they write fictional upstander narratives.

- Emphasize the importance of students being respectful to the real stories of upstanders and what Holocaust victims went through as they write their stories. Remind students that, while narrative writing is creative and can be fun, the time period they are writing about was horrific for the victims.

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment.

- For some students, this assessment may require more than the 30 minutes allotted. Provide time over multiple days if necessary.

- To support ELLs, this lesson invites students to complete an assessment in which they use the planning they have done in previous lessons to draft a historical narrative. This assessment supports ELLs by highlighting the importance of the writing process and reinforcing the idea that effective writing develops incrementally through planning, perhaps relieving the pressure felt to produce “perfect” papers on the first try, in one sitting.

- ELLs may find it challenging to independently organize the planning they have done into one cohesive piece of writing. Help students to break down tasks into manageable chunks and to focus on one element of the historical narrative at a time. Encourage students to do their best, and assure them that they will continue learning together after the assessment.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.A.2, 8.I.A.4, and 8.II.B.5.

Assessment Guidance

- Assessment materials (student copy, answer key, student exemplar, teacher checklist) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback to students on this assessment, use the Narrative Writing rubric (see Module 1 Teacher Guide: Appendix and/or Tools Page, https://eled.org/tools) and the annotated sample narrative interview to help complete the student Tracking Progress recording form. Make notes in the appropriate column for each criterion in a different color than student responses. There is also space provided to respond to student comments. Save a copy of the scored essays to determine student growth from their Module 1, Unit 2 narratives. These pieces can be used to measure the progress of individual students throughout the year, as well as to identify common instructional needs in a class.

Down the Road

- In the upcoming lessons, students will revise the narrative interview they drafted in this lesson and create graphic panels that illustrate their narrative.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- As students enter the classroom, invite them to complete **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 11** using their **Mid-Unit 3 Assessments with feedback** on their desks.

- Circulate as students review their feedback, and offer guidance and support as necessary.

- Once all students are ready, invite them to share their stars and steps with a partner. Remind students that everyone is working toward individual goals and that learning is about continued growth and development.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. End of Unit 3 Assessment: Write a Narrative in Interview Form – W.8.3 (30 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can draft an imagined historical narrative using dialogue, pacing, sensory language, and descriptive details.”

- Distribute the **End of Unit 3 Assessment: Write a Narrative in Interview Form**.

- Invite students to retrieve the following materials:

- **Narrative Writing checklist**

- **Upstander Model: “Interview with Anna Jensen”**

- **Upstander Profile graphic organizer**

- **Narrative Writing Practice: Upstander Biography note-catcher**

- **Upstander Profile: Interview planner**

- **Narrative Writing Practice: Pacing, Dialogue, and Sensory Details note-catcher**

- **Narrative Writing Practice: Exploded Moment note-catcher**

- Tell students that they will use their plans to write their narratives.

- Guide students to open up the **word processor** through which they will draft their narratives.

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence. Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**, and review *perseverance* and what this looks and sounds like. Remind students that as they will be writing their full narrative today, they may need to practice perseverance.

- Remind students that they planned this essay in the previous lessons.

- Invite students to begin the assessment.

- While students are taking the assessment, circulate to monitor and document their narrative writing skills. Refer to the **End of Unit 3 Assessment: Write a Narrative in Interview Form (answers for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

- Repeat, inviting students to self-assess how well they persevered in this lesson.

For Lighter Support

- Before the assessment, underline key vocabulary in the directions and prompt and read aloud together as a class to ensure that students understand each task included in the assessment. Invite students who need lighter support to restate or clarify information for students who need heavier support.

For Heavier Support

- Before the assessment, review the Narrative Writing checklist to help students recall the essential features they will need to include in their narratives. As time allows, invite students to orally rehearse what they will write and to review the planning they have done in Lessons 6–10 with a partner.

Closing and Assessment

A. Track Progress: Narrative Writing – W.8.3 (10 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can draft an imagined historical narrative using dialogue, pacing, sensory language, and descriptive details.”

- Refocus whole group.

- Give students specific positive feedback on their completion of the End of Unit 3 Assessment: Write a Narrative in Interview Form.

- Distribute **Track Progress folders**, **Track Progress: Narrative Writing**, and **sticky notes**. Remind students that they wrote a narrative in Module 1 about a Latin American folklore monster and self-assessed their progress towards meeting the criterion. Explain to students that they will track their progress using the same recording form from Module 1.

- Tell students the sticky notes are for them to find evidence of the following criteria:

- W.8.3

- Guide students through completing the recording form.

- If productive, use a Goal 1 Conversation Cue to encourage students to expand their responses to the text-dependent questions by giving examples.

“Can you say more about that?”

“Can you give an example?”

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

- Have students place the form in their Track Progress folders, and collect students’ folders.

For Lighter Support

- As with assessments in earlier units, if students seem unsure of how to respond to the open-ended questions, provide examples of statements that answer the questions about previous improvements and goals for future improvement that are directly connected to the criteria within the Track Progress: Narrative Writing handout to help students create clear self-reflection and concrete, attainable personal targets (e.g., “I have improved at using descriptive details, sensory language, and precisely chosen words to capture the action and convey experiences and events.”
