End of Unit 3 Assessment: Write a Narrative in Interview Form

**Name:** **Date:**

Throughout this unit, you have been planning the responses that a fictional upstander from the Holocaust would give in an interview that digs deeply into the experiences that propelled them to act.

In this assessment, you will complete the narrative you have been planning in previous classes. You may use any of your narrative interview planning documents to complete your narrative, paying attention to all aspects of the criteria for narrative writing.

REMEMBER: A well-written narrative (in interview form) will accomplish all of the following:

- Engage and orient your reader by establishing a context and point of view

- Introduce your upstander

- Organize an event sequence that unfolds naturally and logically as your upstander tells their story

- Use narrative techniques, such as dialogue, pacing, description, and reflection, to develop your upstander’s experiences, events, and character

- Use a variety of transition words and phrases to show setting, shifts in time, and the relationship among events

- Use precise words and phrases, relevant descriptive details, and sensory language to capture the action and convey experiences and events your upstander experienced

- Provide a conclusion that follows from and reflects on the narrated experiences

Now, begin work on your narrative. Manage your time carefully so that you can draft your entire narrative.
