**Q & A Directions: Engage each student by asking them the following questions:**

- Why did you choose to “explode” this moment of your narrative into this visual format?

- How did you plan your panels? What process and tools did you use to create your panels?

- What new information about the Holocaust or about being an upstander can your audience learn from what you wrote and drew?

- Please feel free to ask additional questions that come up to each student you visit.

**Takeaways and Feedback:** We would appreciate your feedback to help us with presentations in the future. If you have the time to answer the following questions and fill in the chart with any insights you have **without using any student names** that would be helpful.

- Please consider sharing any lasting takeaways or feedback you have about

- the content (Holocaust events or experiences, upstander characteristics, etc.),

- the process (creating graphic panels, representing experiences in graphic panels, etc.),

- the student work and presentation (the quality of their work, their willingness to answer questions, and their preparedness, eye contact, what they did well, what suggestions you have, etc.), or

- any additional comments.
