(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Directions**: Imagine that a classmate of yours has recently written a text reflection on what she read about Johtje and Aart Vos. Read the text reflection below, and answer the question that follows.

Johtje and Aart Vos were Holocaust upstanders because their own safety was risked to protect the lives of Jews seeking refuge from the Nazis. An upstander stands up on the behalf of others. The Voses took a stand by going against Nazi laws and threats. They could have ignored the cries for help to keep their own family safe. However, their humanity would not let them leave others to be in pain suffer and die. The author states, “The couple never considered their actions heroic and never regretted the decision—though it placed their lives and the lives of their children at risk.” Johtje and Aart did have some help from others. The author writes, “But the couple also had the clandestine support of others in town, including the chief of police who would, through a telephone signal, warn them of an upcoming raid.” The article also states that the Vos family suffered from hunger because they were not able to feed all of the people in their home. Johtje and Aart did not have to suffer this way. They were not responsible for the Jews they sheltered. However, they did what they believed was the right thing to do. They did not do this to receive recognition or to be heroes. When Johtje and Aart Vos welcomed strangers into their home, they would sacrifice their own lives and will save so many others.
