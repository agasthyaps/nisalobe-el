Answers will vary: An upstander is a person who takes action to help others, especially people who are being bullied or threatened in some way by someone more powerful.  
Carl Lutz, a Swiss diplomat to Hungary, was an upstander during the Holocaust. As an upstander, he risked his life to help save Jewish people from death. He issued 8,000 protective letters to Jewish people so that they would not be killed. The Nazis suspected him and tried to have him killed for it, though this order was not carried out. Lutz kept risking his own life to save Jewish people in Hungary. In addition, as an upstander he led others to take action. His rescue work inspired other diplomats to do similar work to save Jewish people. One of these was Raoul Wallenberg. He helped the Swedish government and the Red Cross set up safe houses. This meant that his leadership as an upstander helped even more Jewish people survive. Today, not many people know about Carl Lutz, but he is a perfect example of how an upstander takes risks and leads others to create positive change.
