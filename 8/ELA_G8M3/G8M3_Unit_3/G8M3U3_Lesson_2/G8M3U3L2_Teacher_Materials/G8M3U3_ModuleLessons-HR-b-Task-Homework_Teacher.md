(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Imagine that a classmate of yours has recently written an objective summary of “The Forgotten Swiss Diplomat Who Rescued Thousands from Holocaust.” Read the objective summary below, and answer the questions that follow.

In “The Forgotten Swiss Diplomat Who Rescued Thousands from Holocaust,” the central idea is that Carl Lutz saved thousands of Jews from being deported to extermination camps in Auschwitz during the Holocaust. The text states, “A seasoned diplomat, Lutz had served as the Swiss consul to Palestine, then under British mandate, in the 1930s.” Switzerland remained neutral in the war, and Lutz was their diplomat in Hungary. Hungary became Germany’s ally, and the Nazis eventually occupied the country. Lutz began issuing protective passports to allow Budapest’s Jews to escape Hungary, but in order to save more people, drastic measures were taken by him. If Lutz saw a problem, he would find a solution and he will take action. He then convinced the Germans to allow him to issue 8,000 diplomatic letters of protection. However, he duplicated the letters for entire families, saving approximately 62,000 people. “‘It is the largest civilian rescue operation of the Second World War,’ says Charlotte Schallié.” Other diplomats followed Lutz’s lead and helped Jews escape too. When Nazis stopped deporting Jews and brutally murdered them in Hungary, Lutz organized safe houses across the country to protect Jewish people. He was able to use his diplomatic status to secretly help Holocaust victims escape Budapest. Thousands of Jews were saved because of his protective passports safe houses and compassion.
