5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

L.8.2a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

Lutz’s efforts frustrated Nazi officials in Budapest so much they requested permission from Berlin to have him assassinated**—although this was never carried out**. (from the “Protective Passports” section of “The Forgotten Swiss Diplomat Who Rescued Thousands from Holocaust”)

**Lesson 2 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive before or after the mini grammar lesson on punctuation in Closing and Assessment A.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target **(I can use commas, dashes, and ellipses to indicate a pause, break, or omission)** and L.8.2a by providing an opportunity for students to explore how a dash is used to indicate a pause between clauses. Supporting standards: SL.8.1.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses a dash with the purpose of indicating a pause between two connected clauses.

- Transfer: clause + **—** + clause when answering constructed response questions about punctuation on the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment and in various writing tasks throughout the remainder of Module 3 and in Module 4.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **Lutz’s efforts frustrated Nazi officials in Budapest so much they requested permission from Berlin to have him assassinated <u>—although this was never carried out</u>**.

- Ask:

“What is this sentence about?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **—although this was never carried out**.

- Ask:

“What do you notice about punctuation in this chunk?” (There is a dash at the beginning of it.)

“Is the information that follows the dash a phrase or clause? What makes you think so?” (It’s a clause. We can determine this by identifying a subject \[this\] and a verb phrase \[was never carried out\].)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **Lutz’s efforts frustrated Nazi officials in Budapest so much they requested permission from Berlin to have him assassinated  
  <u>—although this was never carried out.</u>**

- Ask:

“We already determined that the information after the dash in this sentence is a clause. Is the information before the dash a phrase or a clause? How do you know?” (It’s a clause. It has a subject and verb. Its main subject is Lutz’s efforts and its main verb is frustrated.)

“What are other ways we can indicate a pause between clauses?” (We can use a comma with a coordinating conjunction \[for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so\]; a semicolon; a colon; or a period.)

“Can you figure out why the writer used a dash in this sentence instead of one of the other options for connecting two clauses?” (A dash indicates a follow-up thought or additional clarifying information. The second clause in this sentence clarifies the information in the first and offers a follow-up detail.)

- Ask:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target:  
‘I can use commas, dashes, and ellipses to indicate a pause, break, or omission’?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

> **I am ready to write a text reflection—since \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

independent clause subordinate clause

> (clause + **—** + clause)

- Say:

“Use this frame to talk about your preparation for writing a text reflection in your own words with your partners.”

- Possible student answers:

> **I am ready to write a text reflection—since <u>I have read and considered the text carefully.</u>**

independent clause subordinate clause

> (clause + **—** + clause)
