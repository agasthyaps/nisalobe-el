Anchor Chart

**Praise, Question, Suggestion Protocol**

1.  **Form your designated pair or triad**

<!-- -->

1.  **Read the identified revision questions aloud with your group.**

2.  **Student 1 presents a draft.** She asks peers to focus on a particular revision question or two that she is struggling with from the list generated above.

3.  **Students offer feedback:**

- **Praise:** Praise needs to be specific. Simply saying, “This is good” doesn’t help the creator. Comments such as “I notice that you used descriptive picture captions” or “You have a catchy title that makes me want to read your piece” are much more useful.

<!-- -->

- Focus on what is praiseworthy or working well, and share with presenter.

- Keep praise related to the revision questions identified.

<!-- -->

- **Questions and Suggestions:** Questions and suggestions should also be specific, for example: “This part is unclear. I wonder if it would be better to explain the importance of the reflection?” or “I can’t tell the importance of the panel. Maybe you could include some dialogue that would show how the person is feeling or explain some of the action?”

<!-- -->

- Ask questions and offer helpful suggestions to the presenter.

- Keep questions and suggestions related to the revision questions identified.

4.  **Synthesis:** After all group members offer feedback, the presenter discusses which suggestions she wants to implement and thanks the group.

5.  **Repeat the process:** Student 2 presents work and cycles through the feedback process. Complete this process for all group members.

6.  **Apply feedback:** Use any remaining time to apply the feedback received from your peers.
