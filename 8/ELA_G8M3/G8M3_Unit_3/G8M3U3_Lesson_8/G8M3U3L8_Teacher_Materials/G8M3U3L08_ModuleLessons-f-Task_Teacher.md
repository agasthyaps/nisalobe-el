Narrative Writing Practice: Upstander  
Biography Note-Catcher

W.8.3

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** At the beginning of your scripted interview there will be a short biography of your fictional upstander, similar to the one in the Create an Upstander Model Narrative. This section introduces your reader to your upstander.

1.  Reread the biography section on the model narrative.

2.  Use the space below to craft the biography for your upstander.

Writing responses from students should be similar in structure and length to the biography section of the model essay, referenced below: I interviewed Anna Jensen on March 22, 2008, near her home in Jupiter, Florida, at the local library where Anna still volunteers. At the time of the interview, Anna was eighty-eight years old. Anna relayed events from her early life in Amsterdam as the middle child of five siblings and shared her experiences in the war, which began when she was a young student, at age twenty-two. Anna was involved in the resistance movement and worked to smuggle Jews to safety. After the war, Anna moved to the United States where she worked as a teacher and librarian, married, and raised three children, one of whom was present at our interview session.
