(For Teacher Reference)

**Lesson 8 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive before students begin creating their upstander profile in  
Work Time A.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target **(I can orient the reader by introducing the narrator, character and setting of my upstander’s interview)** and engages and orients the reader by establishing context and introducing a character (W.8.3a). The sentence also helps students to address L.8.1a by providing an opportunity to explore the conventions of standard English grammar and usage for using relative clauses when writing.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses a relative clause with the purpose of adding important contextual information when introducing an upstander in a narrative.

- Transfer: **which** + verb phrase = relative clause when drafting a narrative during the End of Unit 3 Assessment.

Deconstruct

- **Anna relayed events from her early life in Amsterdam as the middle child of five siblings, and shared her experiences in the war, <u>which began when she was a young student, at age twenty-two.</u>**

- Ask:

“What is this sentence about?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **, which began when she was a young student, at age twenty-two.**

- Ask:

“How does the information in this chunk help to establish context for the narrative?” (This chunk introduces important information about Anna Jensen, the main character in the model narrative. Knowing her age will help us better understand her experience as an upstander during the Holocaust.)

“What is the relative pronoun which referring to? What makes you think so?” (Which refers to the war. We know this because the war is the noun phrase that comes directly before which. Relative pronouns always replace the noun phrase that comes at the end of the previous clause.)

“Why does the writer use a comma in front of which?” (Because the information within this chunk is extra information that is not necessary for understanding the meaning of the noun phrase the war. The comma indicates a pause or separation between the main clause of the sentence and this relative clause.)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **Anna relayed events from her early life in Amsterdam as the middle child of five siblings, and shared her experiences in the  
  war <u>, which began when she was a young student, at age twenty-two</u>**.

- Ask:

“What if we remove the relative clause from the sentence?” (The sentence is grammatical, but we lose important information about Anna Jensen and the context of the narrative.)

“Can we replace which with a different relative pronoun like that, who, when, or where?” (The only other relative pronoun we can use is that. Where refers to a location, who refers to living things, and when refers to a specific time. Which and that refer to things.)

“Can you figure out how the meaning changes if we replace the comma and which with that?” (Which is used with a comma in front of it to add information that is not essential for understanding what the noun phrase before it refers to. If we use that, the information in the relative clause becomes essential for defining the war. In this case, there is only one war \[WWII\], so it would be unnecessary to distinguish it from other wars with an essential relative clause.)

- Ask:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target:  
‘I can orient the reader by introducing the narrator, character and setting of my upstander’s interview’?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

> **When considering the experience of Holocaust victims and upstanders, we**

independent clause

> **practice empathy, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

relative clause

> **(relative clause = which + verb + \[adverb phrase/object\])**

- Say:

“Use this frame to talk about practicing empathy when considering the experiences of Holocaust victims and upstanders.”
