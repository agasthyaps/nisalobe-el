Upstander Profile Graphic Organizer

W.8.3a, W.8.4

(Example for Teacher Reference)

You will be writing a narrative interview to describe your upstander’s experiences in the Holocaust, focusing on one particular moment where he or she made a conscious decision to take action.

The format of the narrative will be similar to the one in the model you analyzed. You will write a series of questions and answers, in interview style, between yourself (the interviewer) and your upstander (the interviewee).

Use this planner to organize your ideas and determine aspects of your upstander’s experience.

1.  Upstander Name:

Anna Jensen

2.  Where does the interview take place?

I interviewed Anna at a library near her daughter’s house (where Anna now lives). Anna still volunteers at the library and has worked there for the last forty years. She lives in Jupiter, Florida, where we met, which is not far from my home in Pompano Beach, Florida.

3.  What is the age of your upstander now (at the time of interview) and during the Holocaust?

At the time of the interview, in 2008, Anna was 88. During the event she describes, in 1942, Anna was 22.

4.  Where is your upstander from? (Be specific about country, city, etc.)

Anna was born in Amsterdam and lived there for most of her youth. She was a student in the city and found an apartment near her college in the *Jodenbuurt* neighborhood, but she had grown up in a village just a few miles from the city. After the war, she moved to the United States, spending time in New York, and settling in Florida.

5.  What was your upstander’s life like before the Holocaust?

Anna was the middle of five siblings and grew up in a household full of noise and activity. Her father ran the local newspaper in their village, and her mother was a teacher. Anna hoped to follow in her mother’s footsteps and started school for education. As well as appreciating nature and the outdoors, Anna’s family valued reading, learning, and art. Anna and her siblings grew up speaking three languages—Dutch, English, and German. She remembers trips to the oceanside and train trips through the country. Her childhood was peaceful and secure.

6.  How was your upstander involved in the Holocaust?

At first, Anna wasn’t involved and was only vaguely aware of the war going on around her. Later, when the suffering of others became apparent, Anna became involved in the resistance. After witnessing the persecution of her neighbor, she spent the rest of the war resisting. She found other people like herself, and they helped their Jewish neighbors find safe houses and bunkers in the countryside.

7.  What is the <u>one</u> specific event you will expand on in your narrative? Describe, briefly, how it propelled your upstander to act.

The story of Anna seeing her neighbor, the local Jewish baker, taken away by the Gestapo while she stood by and watched is one that haunted her and was the impetus for her to take action. This is the scene I will describe in detail. I’ll make sure to describe many details about that event, to set the tone for the rest of the interview (that Anna regretted her complacency during the attack).

8.  How did he or she react or respond when faced with challenges during the Holocaust?

Anna decided to take action. She resisted and risked her life to bring others to safety. Anna was surprised at her own action and resolve but could not see another path. After witnessing her baker’s suffering, she decided that her small actions to save others were the least she could do in the midst of the pain and suffering going on her around her.

9.  What defines your character as an upstander (use the class criteria for reference)?

Anna was an upstander because she felt in her heart that the persecution of her Jewish neighbors was wrong, and instead of ignoring these feelings, she acted upon them. Once she got involved in the resistance, she knew she was willing to risk her life to bring safety and peace to others. The work she did was risky, but it was worth it to her. She knew that if she did not help, she would not be able to live with herself. For every person she was able to save, she thought of her baker and wished she had acted in time to save his life.

10. Who is your upstander modelled after? (List any upstanders we studied whose lives influenced the creation of your fictional upstander.)

There were many people who risked their lives to transfer Jews to safety. A few voices we read, in particular, that helped me form my ideas on Anna are listed below:

- Johtje Vos

- Miep Gies

11. Are there any additional questions you would like to capture?

Answers will vary.
