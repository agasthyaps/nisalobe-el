Language Dive: Upstander Model: “Interview with Anna Jensen,” Page 1 Sentence Chunk Chart

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

At first I couldn’t tell what was going on, but suddenly I realized that **my friend the baker was surrounded by two German soldiers with swastikas stitched on their uniforms**. (from Upstander Model: “Interview with Anna Jensen”)

Launch

Consider displaying an image of a swastika and reviewing its meaning within the context of Nazi Germany and WWII. Help students to understand that for Jews and other Holocaust victims, this symbol likely represents anti-Semitism and terror and abuse.

At first I couldn’t tell what was going on,

Deconstruct

- **At first**

“Can you figure out why the writer begins this sentence with at first?” (To introduce a sequence of events within an experience for pacing. \[adverb; linking phrase\])

- Students can refer back to Upstander Model: “Interview with Anna Jensen” and reread the sentence that comes before this one (“\[a\]s I turned the corner, I heard shouts and scuffling”) to consider why Anna would have been uncertain of what was happening and what she might have been thinking.

but suddenly I realized that

Deconstruct

- **suddenly**

“What would happen if we removed the word suddenly from this chunk?” (The meaning would stay the same, but we would lose an important detail about how Anna Jensen’s experience unfolded. \[adverb; linking phrase\])

- Students can take 30 second in pairs to discuss a time when they suddenly realized something.

my friend the baker was surrounded by two German soldiers with swastikas stitched on their uniforms.

Deconstruct: (Focus Structure)

- Ask:

“Can you figure out whether this clause is written in active or passive voice? What in the sentence makes you think so?” (We know this is written in passive voice because the verb was surrounded follows a passive construction \[be + verb + -ed/-en\]). Step 2

- **was surrounded**

“Who are the people that are the subject and object of the verb was surrounded?’ (\[T\]wo German soldiers with swastikas stitched on their uniforms is the subject, and my friend the baker is the object.)

“Can you figure out why Anna Jensen said this clause in passive voice?” (To emphasize the effect of the event on her friend, the baker.)

- **swastikas stitched on their uniforms**

“Why do you think the writer includes a detail about the swastikas stitched on the soldiers’ uniforms?” (To remind the reader of the danger Anna Jensen’s friend was in at this moment.)

- Students can use Conversation Cues as they discuss. To provide heavier support, display a suggested sequence, such as the one below:

- Goal 1. Can you say more about that?

- Goal 2. Who can repeat what they said?

- Goal 3: Why do you think that?

- Goal 4: Do you agree or disagree with what your classmate said? Why?

- Students can take 30 second to visualize the event that Anna Jensen is describing and then share what they envisioned with a partner.

Practice (Focus Structure)

At first I couldn’t tell what was going on, but suddenly I realized that my friend the baker was surrounded by two German soldiers with swastikas stitched on their uniforms.

Reconstruct

- Ask:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Answers will vary.)

“What words and phrases in this sentence provide descriptive details that convey Anna Jensen’s experience?” (At first, suddenly, swastika.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question: how did upstanders respond and what can we learn from their voices?” (Answers will vary, but look for students to identify that this sentence conveys how an imaginary upstander felt during a specific moment, giving us more information gives us more information about the experiences of upstanders during the Holocaust, and in particular, how frightening it might have been.)

Practice (Sentence)

- Students can consider the differences when this clause within this sentence in rewritten in active voice.

> At first I couldn’t tell what was going on, but suddenly I realized that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
>
> (Example: At first I couldn’t tell what was going on, but suddenly I realized that two German soldiers with swastikas stitched on their uniforms had surrounded my friend the baker.) Step 4

- To provide lighter support: “How does writing this sentence with a clause in active voice change the meaning of the sentence?”

- To provide heavier support: Display the sentence rewritten with a clause in active voice, and invite students to compare the differences in structure and meaning.
