Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 10

W.8.3b

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, complete the tasks and answer the questions.

Use an online or print dictionary, and determine the meaning of the word **impetus**. Put your response in the space below.

Impetus: the force that makes something happen or happen more quickly

Find your Upstander Profile graphic organizer, and reread your initial response to question 7:

“What is the <u>one</u> specific event you will expand on in your narrative? Describe it, briefly.”

How will expanding this moment help you reveal your upstander’s impetus to act?

Answers will vary. The story of Anna seeing her neighbor, the local Jewish baker, taken away by the Gestapo while she stood by and watched is one that haunted her and was the impetus for her to take action. This is the scene I will describe in detail. I’ll make sure to describe many details about that event, to set the tone for the rest of the interview (that Anna regretted her complacency during the attack).

What kind of description will help you do this?

Students should identify they will need to take time (slow down) and add description about the particular event that helps the reader imagine the event.
