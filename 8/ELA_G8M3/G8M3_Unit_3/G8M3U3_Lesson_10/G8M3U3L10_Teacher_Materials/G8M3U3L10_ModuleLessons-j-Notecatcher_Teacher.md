Example response, from the model narrative:

The reason I got started with this work is actually because of a terrible event I witnessed.  
I remember it so well. It was a beautiful spring day in 1942 in Amsterdam. I was studying to be a teacher, and I had so much work to do that night that I knew I wouldn’t have time to make dinner. I stopped at the local Jewish bakery for a loaf of fresh-baked rye bread. The baker made such wonderful bread—the whole neighborhood loved his bakery.  
As I turned the corner, I heard shouts and scuffling. At first I couldn’t tell what was going on, but suddenly I realized that my friend the baker was surrounded by two German soldiers with swastikas stitched on their uniforms. They were dragging him out of his bakery. For that instant, time stood still. Horrified, I watched the soldiers muscle him into a military truck and drive away. As the siren’s scream filled the air, I could barely hear beneath that sound the muffled screams of the baker—and then they were gone.  
The muffled screams of the baker, the baker’s apron hanging there on a hook as if the baker had just stepped out for a moment to buy butter. But a dreadful emptiness filled the bakery. I never saw him again.
