3.  Use precise, relevant, and descriptive details to turn the following sentence about Johtje Vos into a reflective statement.

Once the war was over, Johtje Vos did not want to talk about her experience saving people. But her daughter persuaded her to.

Use the space below to capture your draft:

I hoped I would never have to think about the war again. But then I realized that if I did not speak about it, people today might forget what happened. It now seems very important that we speak out. As someone who lived through Holocaust, I now understand that I have an obligation to remind others what happened, so we can prevent anything like this from happening again. Now it is hard to tell, but my hope is that my actions will lead to good in the world.
