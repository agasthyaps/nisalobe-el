Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- SL.8.5 – Opening A: Students determine which part of their narrative they would like to turn into graphic panels on an entrance ticket.

- W.8.5 – Work Time A: Students use feedback from their peers to make revisions to their narratives.

- W.8.3 – Work Time A: Students briefly revise their narrative interviews to align with narrative criteria.

- SL.8.5 – Work Time B: Students analyze model graphic panels that illustrate information from the model narrative.

- SL.8.5 – Closing and Assessment A: Students begin to plan the sequence of information from their narrative to illustrate in their graphic panels, which will be used to clarify information and add interest to their presentation for the performance task.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Students may spend more time offering constructive feedback to their partner on their narrative interviews. Students may spend additional time using peer feedback to improve their narratives.

- Students can generate a proofreading checklist with punctuation and verb voice and mood, and gerunds and infinitives. This checklist can then be used to review their own work or that of their peers. Have students generate three actionable steps they can take based on what they discover using the checklist.

- Have students look for places to extend the responses to questions in their narratives and places where they can add additional detail. Students may also add in follow-up questions with additional responses.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students drafted their narrative interview for the end of unit assessment. In this lesson, students will provide peer feedback on their narratives and begin to plan the graphic panels that illustrate a moment in their narrative.

Support All Students

- Narratives can be drafted and edited using an online tool (e.g., http://eled.org/0158). Peer sharing and critique can also be done this way using track changes.

- Peer feedback requires strong empathy and growth mindset. For Work Time A, consider preselecting student partnerships to strategically group students who can be supportive of one another both in skills and in confidence and kindness and provide supportive partners for students who might struggle with the task. Model a kind and constructive critique or have a pair of students model this. Continually ground students in the ideas of working to become ethical people. ▲

- Some students may need support with planning the techniques used in a graphic novel. Invite students to refer to the anchor text for examples.

- Students may benefit from creating an anchor chart that identifies the characteristics of effective graphic panels to guide their planning.

- To support ELLs, this lesson includes supportive peer review using the Praise, Question, Suggestion protocol, guided analysis of a model graphic panel, and time for students to plan their own graphic panels. Students will carefully review their narrative interviews to select a moment to explode for their graphic panels and think carefully about the Model Graphic Panels and how they capture an exploded moment from the model narrative interview.

- ELLs may find it challenging to select a moment from their narrative to explode in their graphic panel. Reassure students that there are likely many moments in their narrative interviews that could be represented in a graphic panel. Encourage students to consider what they feel most comfortable translating to a visual representation, and use Conversation Cues and discussion in home language groups to support students in reaching a decision and in carrying out initial design planning.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.A.1, 8.I.A.3, and 8.II.A.1.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Graphic Panels Sequence planner from Closing and Assessment A to ensure students are prepared to create graphic panels that illustrate a moment in their narrative.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will finish planning their graphic panels and illustrate their graphic panels.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 12.

- Strategically pair students for the peer feedback in Work Time A.

- Ensure there is a copy of Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 12 at each student’s workspace.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous modules to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – SL.8.5 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 12**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Peer Feedback: Praise, Question, Suggestion – W.8.5 (15 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can give kind, specific, and helpful feedback to my peers.”

- Display the **Praise, Question, Suggestion Protocol anchor chart**.

- Remind students that they used Praise, Question, Suggestion in Lesson 8 to provide feedback to their classmates. Explain to students that they will use this peer feedback method to critique their partner’s narrative interview so they may improve their draft.

- Organize students into pairs.

- Focus students on the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart** and remind them specifically of respect and compassion. Remind students that the purpose of peer feedback is to help the other student improve his or her work, so when providing feedback, be careful to act with respect and compassion.

- Ask a volunteer to read the following revision questions aloud:

“What is one interview question and answer your partner successfully created that helps tell their upstander’s story?”

“What is one question you have about your partner’s narrative?” (E.g., “Why did you choose this technique to explode the moment?” “How did you choose your follow-up questions?”)

“What would make this narrative interview stronger?” (E.g., “This narrative would be stronger if you added more sensory details to the third response.”)

- Student A presents the draft of their narrative, giving time for Student B to view it and read it.

- Student B will first focus on what is praiseworthy or working well. Remind students that <u>praise</u> needs to be specific. Simply saying, “This is good” doesn’t help the creator. Comments such as, “This interview question/answer helps tell your upstander’s story because . . . ,” are much more useful. Students can capture their praise on **sticky notes**.

- Next, student B asks <u>questions</u> and offers helpful <u>suggestions</u>. Remind students that <u>questions</u> and <u>suggestions</u> should also be specific, for example: “Why did you decide to explode this moment?” or “I can’t tell the importance of this question. Maybe you could add a question so the answer offers more details about your upstander.” Students can capture their questions and suggestions on sticky notes.

- Feedback should relate to the displayed revision questions.

- After student B has offered feedback, student A discusses which suggestions they want to implement and thanks their partner.

- Repeat process with student B.

- As time allows, invite students to apply the feedback they received from their partner.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

B. Analyze Graphic Panels - SL.8.5 (10 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze how model graphic panels illustrate information in a narrative.”

- Explain to students that they will illustrate a moment from their narrative interview in graphic panels, similar to the graphic panels they created in Lesson 6. Students will choose a moment in their narrative interview to illustrate in their graphic panels to present to an audience for their performance task.

- Display the **Upstander Model: “Interview with Anna Jensen,”** and instruct students to retrieve their copies. Ask students to glance over the narrative to review the details of the interview.

- Display and distribute the **Model Graphic Panels**. Explain to students that the model is an illustration of a moment in the Upstander Model: “Interview with Anna Jensen.” Read aloud the dialogue for the first read, then have a volunteer read aloud the dialogue for the second read.

- Ask students to share what they notice about how the illustrator exploded the moment just by looking at the graphic panels.

- Ask students to Turn and Talk:

“How does this graphic panel further show the habits of character the fictionalized upstander Anna Jensen displayed in her work?” (Answers will vary, but may include that it draws attention to the fact that Anna took action to support others, showing compassion, and stood up for what she knew was right, showing integrity.)

- Display the **Graphic Novel Format anchor chart**. Remind students to refer to this anchor chart as they analyze the panels.

- Focus students on the first panel.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What do you notice in the panel? What can you infer from the thought bubble?” (There’s a woman with glasses, she looks older; she’s remembering something that happened in the past.)

- Focus students on the second and third panels.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What do you notice in the panels? (A bakery, Amsterdam 1942, a man with a baker’s hat is being attacked.)

“What is the woman remembering in these two panels?” (A Jewish baker was beaten by two men.)

- Focus students on the fourth, fifth, and sixth panels.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What do you notice in the panels?” (The woman has a shocked expression, the caption says she hears sirens, a truck drives away, a baker’s hat and spoon are on the ground, the woman walks into the bakery.)

“What is the woman remembering in these two panels?” (The Jewish baker is taken away by the two men; she goes into the bakery.)

“Why do you think this moment from the narrative interview was chosen for the graphic panels?” (Answers will vary, but may include that it was the moment that inspired her work.)

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time B, as students analyze the Model Graphic Panels, strategically use combinations of Conversation Cues to help students who need lighter support to listen to one another and deepen their thinking. For example:

- “Can you say more about that?” (Goal 1)

- “Who can tell us what your classmate said in your own words?” (Goal 2)

- “What, in the text, makes you think so?” (Goal 3)

- “Who can explain why your classmate came up with that response?” (Goal 4)

- If students participated in individual writing check-ins earlier in the unit, follow up with ELLs to discuss the experience of writing a narrative interview for the End of Unit 3 Assessment. Invite students to revisit the action plans they created for working toward their goals to check in on progress and growth.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time B, as students analyze the Model Graphic Panels, strategically use combinations of Conversation Cues to help students who need heavier support to listen to one another and expand the conversation. For example:

- “I’ll give you time to discuss this with a partner.” (Goal 1)

- “Who can repeat what your classmate said?” (Goal 2)

- “Do you agree or disagree with what your classmate said? Why?” (Goal 4)

- “So, do you mean \_\_\_?” (Goal 1)

- If students participated in individual writing check-ins earlier in the unit, follow up with ELLs to discuss the experience of writing a narrative interview for the End of Unit 3 Assessment. Revisit the list of statements that students used to self-assess to check on progress and growth:

- I am able to use descriptive details to engage the reader.

- I can structure a piece of writing so that it is easy to follow.

- I can vary vocabulary to make my writing interesting.

- I can use different types of punctuation in my writing to indicate a pause.

- I can use relative clauses to add information and ideas.

Work Time

C. Introduce Model Graphic Panels Sequence Planner - SL.8.5 (5 minutes)

- Display and distribute the **Model** **Graphic Panels Sequence planner**. Explain to students that this model is an example of how the author used a planner to determine how to illustrate the moment in the Upstander Model: “Interview with Anna Jensen” that students saw represented in Model Graphic Panels.

- Tell students that they will be planning their own graphic panels using this same planner. Explain that this planner will help them brainstorm to find the moment in their narrative they would like to illustrate in their graphic panels. It will also help them determine what illustrations, thought bubbles, speech bubbles, and descriptions they will include in each panel.

- Read aloud the directions and the information filled in for each panel on Model Graphic Panels Sequence planner, as students follow along. Answer any clarifying questions.

Closing and Assessment

A. Plan Graphic Panels – SL.8.5 (10 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can plan the sequence of my graphic panels that illustrate a moment in my narrative.”

- Tell students that they are now going to begin to plan their own graphic panels.

- Invite students to retrieve their **narrative interview drafts**. Instruct students to begin planning their graphic panels.

- Circulate to support students as they plan. Invite those students who need to sketch out their sequence to do so. Look out for students who struggle with sequence so their graphic panels depict a clear moment from their narrative. Assure students that they will have more time to complete the **Graphic Panels Sequence planner**.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
