**“Marek Edelman Obituary” Excerpt**

Marek Edelman was the last surviving leader of the ill-fated Warsaw Ghetto uprising of 1943. The revolt was the first and largest act of armed urban resistance to the Germans during the second world war.

Turning 20 when the Germans invaded Poland in September 1939, he found himself corralled into a ghetto in the heart of Warsaw. Initially the ghetto survived on its own resources, even running schools, clinics and theatres. Soon, though, its inhabitants were stripped of their civic rights, forced to wear the Star of David, barred from normal work or contact with others, starved and subjected to the cruel whims of Nazi agents.

Then, on 22 July 1942, Nazis began deporting people at a rate of 6,000 a day. Edelman knew from camp escapees that the promised “resettlement” meant extermination in Treblinka. Six days after the first deportations Mordechai Anielewicz, Edelman and others formed the Jewish Combat Organisation, known by its Polish acronym ŻOB.

Edelman landed a job as a hospital messenger and used his influence to recruit fighters. On 18 January 1943, ŻOB troops disguised themselves as deportees and opened fire on the Nazis, disrupting expulsions and spreading the legend of resistance to similar ghettos in Vilna, Białystok, Minsk, Łódź and Riga.

The Nazis planned to liquidate the ghetto within three days; but suddenly were forced to retreat as seemingly every window in vacated blocks opened with gunfire. Ultimately it took the Germans three weeks to quell the uprising. “It was a defensive action,” Edelman later explained. “We fought simply to stop the Germans alone picking the time and place of our deaths.”

Although ŻOB’s 220 core fighters, men and women, lacked the tanks, artillery and aerial support that their 2,000 German foes employed, they made the professional soldiers pay dearly.

Eventually the Germans used scorched-earth tactics to force out the resistance fighters. Edelman fled through the sewers.

“We fought to protect the people in the ghetto, to extend their life by a day or two,” said Edelman. He knew that the ghetto defenders could never win.

Edelman was never shy of voicing strong opinions. He joined the anti-communist Workers’ Defence Committee after 1976 and would defend the record of Catholic Polish partisans when scholars accused Poles of conniving in the murder of Jews, yet with equal vigour he spoke out against a memorial to displaced Germans.
