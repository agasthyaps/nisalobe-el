**Directions**: Imagine that a classmate of yours has recently written a text reflection on “The Forgotten Swiss Diplomat Who Rescued Thousands from Holocaust.” Read the text reflection below, and answer the questions that follow.

One major character trait of an upstander is taking risks when one does not have to take risks. Carl Lutz, a Swiss diplomat, risked his life to save approximately 62,000 Jews even though his homeland was not involved in the war. Switzerland was neutral in World War II and did not want any of their representatives to take sides. Lutz did not benefit from any personal gain for his deeds, and he was almost killed for helping the Jews. When Nazis stopped deporting Jews and brutally murdered them in Hungary, Lutz organized safe houses across the country to protect Jewish people. He was able to use his diplomatic status to secretly help Holocaust victims escape Budapest. “Lutz’s efforts frustrated Nazi officials in Budapest so much they requested permission from Berlin to have him assassinated—although this was never carried out.” Another upstander characteristic is leading others to take action. Carl Lutz’s operation was the largest civilian rescue of World War II and he inspired other rescue operations. “Other diplomats learnt from Lutz’s methods and did the same. . . .” In addition to the protective passports he issued, Lutz set up 76 safe houses in Hungary to protect Jews from persecution. Unfortunately, Lutz was not recognized as a hero once he returned to Switzerland after the war. He was condemned for intervening in the war. As a result, not many people know about Carl Lutz, but he is a perfect example of how an upstander takes risks and leads others to create positive change.
