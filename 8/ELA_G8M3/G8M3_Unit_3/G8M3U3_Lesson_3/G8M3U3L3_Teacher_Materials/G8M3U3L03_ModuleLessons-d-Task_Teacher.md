An upstander is a person who takes action to help others, especially people who are being persecuted or threatened in some way by someone more powerful. Marek Edelman was one of the leaders of the Warsaw uprising of 1943. As an upstander, Marek felt deep compassion for the Jewish people in the ghetto. He tried to help them by rebelling against the Nazis. Edelman knew they could not defeat the Nazis, but he still “fought to protect the people in the ghetto, to extend their life by a day or two.” He cared enough about people to want them to live as long as they possibly could. In addition, Marek was able to lead others to join him in the uprising. Even though the uprising was unsuccessful, it “was the first and largest act of armed urban resistance to the Germans during the second world war.” Edelman was one of the few survivors of the uprising, but he led the resistance prepared to die. Marek Edelman’s leadership demonstrates how a strong upstander can influence others to be upstanders too.
