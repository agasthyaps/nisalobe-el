, yet

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Ask:

“Can you figure out why the author included a comma before yet?” (Because yet is a coordinating conjunction. We use a comma before a coordinating conjunction that connects two independent clauses to indicate a pause.) Step 2

“What would happen if we remove the comma before yet?” (It would be challenging to understand the meaning of the sentence because we would not be prompted to pause to consider the information included in the first independent clause before reading the information included in the second independent clause.)

“What do you think the meaning of yet is?” (Nevertheless, but, at the same time.)

- Students can use Conversation Cues as they discuss. To provide heavier support, display a suggested sequence, such as the one below:

- Goal 1. Can you say more about that?

- Goal 2. Who can repeat what they said?

- Goal 3: Why do you think that?

- Goal 4: Do you agree or disagree with what your classmate said? Why?

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Students can experiment with combining the sentences below in different ways with yet to see which ones make sense and which ones do not.  Step 3

- To provide heavier support: Invite students to discuss the meaning of the sentences in home language groups.

with equal vigour he spoke out against a memorial to displaced Germans.

Deconstruct

- **spoke out**

“What does it mean to speak out against something?” (To voice an opinion that opposes something. \[phrasal verb\])

“What was Marek Edelman speaking out against?” (A memorial that honored Germans who had lost their homes.)

“Why do you think the writer used yet to connect this independent clause with the one before it?” (To express that the information in this clause is surprising and unexpected in contrast to the information in the first clause.)

- Students can spend 30 seconds discussing other examples of other upstanders that spoke out during the Holocaust.

He joined the anti-communist Workers’ Defence Committee after 1976 and would defend the record of Catholic Polish partisans when scholars accused Poles of conniving in the murder of Jews, yet with equal vigour he spoke out against a memorial to displaced Germans.

Reconstruct

- Ask:

“What if we replace yet with a different coordinating conjunction? How does the meaning change?” (We can use but in a similar way to express contrast; but we lose the connotation of it being somewhat surprising or especially interesting. it is possible to use and, but the contrast becomes unclear. If we use any of the other coordinating conjunctions—for, or, nor, so—the sentence does not make sense.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question: how did upstanders respond and what can we learn from their voices?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to identify that this sentence provides examples of specific actions taken by an upstander.)
