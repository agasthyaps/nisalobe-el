Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- L.8.2a – Opening A: Students answer constructed response questions on the use of punctuation in a text reflection.

- RI.8.2 – Work Time A: Students determine the central idea of “Marek Edelman Obituary” Excerpt and analyze its development over the course of the text.

- RI.8.1 – Work Time A: Students cite evidence from the text that supports the central idea.

- W.8.4 – Work Time B: Students write a clear and coherent text reflection of “Marek Edelman Obituary” Excerpt.

- RI.8.1 – Work Time B: Students use evidence from “Marek Edelman Obituary” Excerpt to support their text reflection.

- L.8.2a – Closing and Assessment A: Students analyze a sentence during a Language Dive to explore the use of punctuation to indicate a pause or break.

- L.8.1c – Students analyze a sentence during a Language Dive to explore how the conditional mood is formed and used.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Students may conduct research on Marek Edelman and write a text reflection about other upstander characteristics Marek Edelman exhibited.

- Students can conduct research on the Warsaw Uprising and find examples of other upstanders who worked with Edelman during this resistance movement. Students can write about or discuss what they have learned in small groups or with the class as a whole.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students wrote a text reflection about a Holocaust upstander. Students will continue this work by reading about a new Holocaust upstander and writing a text reflection about how this person demonstrates upstander characteristics.

Support All Students

- Take note that the text in this lesson is an obituary. Most of the text is about Edelman’s role in the Warsaw uprising, but the last few paragraphs are about his life after the war. Students may need support in focusing on the information about his involvement in the Holocaust only, instead of those details. Consider reading the text aloud, highlighting the details relevant to how Marek Edelman was a Holocaust upstander.

- Some students may have difficulty determining the central idea of a new text. Ask prompting questions to support students in identifying the central idea in Work Time A. ▲

- Some students may need support in identifying examples of upstander characteristics and choosing the most relevant supporting evidence. Support students in annotating the text for the most significant details to include in their text reflection. ▲

- Some students may benefit from choosing how they will read the text. Read aloud the text with some students, have student-led groups read amongst themselves, and allow other students to read independently. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson includes supported in-class reading time, the integration of repeated routines, and continued practice with selected and constructed response questions on punctuation and verb voice and mood that are closely aligned with the questions on the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment. For further practice with punctuation (L.8.2a) and the conditional mood (L.8.1c), this lesson also includes a Language Dive using a sentence from the upstander text that students will read in this lesson.

- ELLs may find it challenging to navigate the text in this lesson, as it contains complex language and references to historical events. Encourage students to use the available glossary and to apply the strategies they have acquired for reading unfamiliar texts. Give students ample time to discuss the text with peers before they write the text reflection to help with comprehension and processing.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6, 8.I.B.7, 8.I.B.8, 8.I.C.12, and 8.II.C.6.

Assessment Guidance

- Review student text reflections after the lesson to check whether they are on the right track. Use common issues as teaching points for the whole group in the next lesson.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will choose a text about a new Holocaust upstander and independently write a text reflection about the upstander.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.8.2a (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 3**.

- Using a preferred classroom routine, collect or review the answers to **Homework: Practice Punctuation and Verb Voice and Mood** from Lesson 2. Refer to the **Homework: Practice Punctuation and Verb Voice and Mood (answers for teacher reference)**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read “Marek Edelman Obituary,” Excerpt, and Identify Central Idea – RI.8.2 (15 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can determine a central idea and analyze its development in ‘Marek Edelman Obituary’ Excerpt.”

- Distribute and display **“Marek Edelman Obituary” Excerpt**. Read the text aloud, stopping as needed to check comprehension. As students Think-Pair-Share, highlight or underline key details in the displayed text, and instruct students to track the central idea of the text using the **Track Central Idea: Voices of Upstanders note-catcher**. Refer to **Track Central Idea note-catcher: Voices of Upstanders (example for teacher reference)** for the answers.

- With students’ support, record the meanings of *ill-fated* (destined to fail or have bad luck), *uprising* (a rebellion, or act of resistance), and *corralled* (gathered together) on the **academic word wall**. Write synonyms or sketch a visual above the key terms to scaffold students’ understanding. Invite students to record each word in their **vocabulary logs**, and encourage them to record the definitions in both English and their home languages.

- Think-Pair-Share, and remind students of the habits of an ethical person, particularly empathy, as they discuss the character of Marek Edelman:

“What did Marek Edelman do?” (He lead the Warsaw uprising.)

“The resisters knew they couldn’t win the fight against the Nazis. Why did they still rebel?” (They wanted to choose how they would die instead of letting the Nazis take them to a camp.)

“How does Marek’s empathy for his people influence his rebellion?” (He understood that many felt hopeless, so he decided to fight on their behalf.)

“How did Marek get people to follow him?” (He got a job as a hospital messenger and recruited people.)

“As you read about Marek’s plan of resistance, why do you think it was important for the resisters to choose how they died?” (They wanted to have some kind of power over their fate.)

“What additional habits of character did Marek Edelman exhibit in his actions as an upstander? Explain any habits of character connected to his life experiences and use evidence from the text to support your thinking.” (Answers will vary, but may include that he showed empathy when he fought on behalf of those who could not.)

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share about central idea by asking the following questions:

“What do you think is the central idea of the text?”

“What evidence in the text supports the central idea you determined?”

- As students share, record responses on the displayed Track Central Idea: Voices of Upstanders note-catcher. Instruct students to follow along and record these notes in their note-catcher.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time A, as students read the “Marek Edelman Obituary” Excerpt and fill in their note-catchers, assign each portion of the text a different group of students, and then have students rotate among groups to discuss each section. This will allow students to think deeply about specific information and the exchange during discussion will guide students through the different key details.

For Heavier Support

- To extend work with the conditional mood, before the Language Dive, invite students to review the texts they have read in Lessons 1, 2, and 3 for examples of verbs in the conditional mood. Give students time to share their examples in small groups or with the whole class, and help students to explore the effects created by each (e.g., *possibility*).

Work Time

B. Write a Text Reflection – RI.8.1 (15 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can write a text reflection about ‘Marek Edelman Obituary’ Excerpt.”

- Display the **Characteristics of Upstanders anchor chart**.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What examples of these characteristics did Marek Edelman demonstrate?” (Compassion, leadership.)

- As students share, record their responses in the third column of the anchor chart.

- Explain to students that they will write another text reflection that explains how Marek Edelman was a Holocaust upstander. Remind them that, in the second half of this unit, they will write a narrative interview about an imagined Holocaust upstander based on the upstanders they read about in this unit.

- Display **Criteria for an Effective Text Reflection anchor chart**. Ask a volunteer to read the criteria aloud for the class to review.

- Display and distribute **Text Reflection: “Marek Edelman Obituary” Excerpt.** Read directions aloud.

- Instruct students to begin writing their text reflections independently using the Criteria for an Effective Text Reflection anchor chart to guide them.

- Circulate to support students as they write to ensure they are on task.

- Remind students to use key details from “Marek Edelman Obituary” Excerpt to determine how Marek Edelman was a Holocaust upstander. Refer to **Text Reflection: “Marek Edelman Obituary” Excerpt (for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Closing and Assessment

A. Language Dive: “Marek Edelman Obituary” Excerpt, Paragraph 10 – L.8.2a (10 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can use commas, dashes, and ellipses to indicate a pause, break, or omission.”

- Display the **Questions We Can Ask during a Language Dive anchor chart**. Ensure students understand how to use these questions, pointing out that the questions underlined on the anchor chart are questions that students should always ask when they dive into a sentence.

- Refer to the **Questions We Can Ask during a Language Dive anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Reread paragraph 10 of “Marek Edelman Obituary” Excerpt.

- Focus students on the sentence below:

- He joined the anti-communist Workers’ Defence Committee after 1976 and would defend the record of Catholic Polish partisans when scholars accused Poles of conniving in the murder of Jews, yet with equal vigour he spoke out against a memorial to displaced Germans.

- Use the **Language Dive Guide: “Marek Edelman Obituary” Excerpt, Paragraph 10 (for teacher reference)** and the **Language Dive: “Marek Edelman Obituary” Excerpt, Paragraph 10 Sentence Chunk Chart** to guide students through a Language Dive conversation about the sentence. Distribute and display the **Language Dive: “Marek Edelman Obituary” Excerpt, Paragraph 10 note-catcher**, and the **Language Dive: “Marek Edelman Obituary” Excerpt, Paragraph 10 sentence chunk strips**. Refer to the **Language Dive: “Marek Edelman Obituary” Excerpt, Paragraph 10 note-catcher (for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Homework

A. Punctuation and Verb Voice and Mood

- Students complete **Homework: Punctuation and Verb Voice and Mood: Text Reflection** to answer selected response questions on punctuation and verb voice and mood.
