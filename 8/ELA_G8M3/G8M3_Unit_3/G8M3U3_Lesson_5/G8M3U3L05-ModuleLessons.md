Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Work Time A: Students complete their mid-unit assessment by answering questions about punctuation, voice, and mood. (L.8.1b, L.8.1c, L.8.1d, L.8.2a, L.8.2b)

- RI.8.10 – Closing and Assessment: Students share the independent research reading they have been doing for homework.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Create additional selected and constructed response questions for students to further analyze punctuation, voice, and mood in a text.

- Students can create a visual summary or series of graphic panels that represent the events in the texts they have read for Independent Research Reading and share these with the class during Closing and Assessment A.

- After students have finished the assessment, they can write a short reflection on the progress they have made with using verb voice and mood. Unlike other assessments, this one is not followed by a formal Track Progress task. Reflecting independently can serve a similar purpose as the Track Progress practice.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the first half of this unit, students read about Holocaust upstanders and wrote objective summaries and reflections on these texts. Students also practiced language skills including punctuation, voice, and mood. In this assessment, students will read an objective summary and reflection on a new Holocaust upstander and answer selected and constructed response questions about punctuation, voice, and mood in the text.

Support All Students

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment.

- Some students may need the text read aloud before they work on the questions. Invite students who require this to sit in a group away from the rest of the students, so as not to be distracting.

- For some students, this assessment may require more than the 20 minutes allotted. Provide time over multiple days if necessary.

- To support ELLs, this lesson has a Mid-Unit 3 Assessment that contains questions that closely mirror the selected and constructed response questions students have practiced in Lessons 2, 3, and 4. Students will demonstrate their knowledge of punctuation use and of verb voice and mood. Following the assessment, students will have the opportunity to share their Independent Reading research and to hear from their peers.

- ELLs may find it challenging to complete the assessment independently. Before the assessment, build in time to review the key concepts and conventions that students will be assessed on (punctuation, verb voice and mood) and review previous selected and constructed response questions, as needed. Consider reviewing the structural features of active and passive voice and of verb moods immediately before the assessment to reinforce students’ learning.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.C.12 and 8.II.C.6.

Assessment Guidance

- All assessment materials (student prompt and teacher checklist) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will create a graphic panel that illustrates a moment in the life of one of the upstanders they have learned about.

- Students’ Mid-Unit 3 Assessments will be returned in Lesson 11 with feedback.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare

- Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 5

- Module 3 End of Unit 2 Assessments with feedback

- Mid-Unit 3 Assessment: Language Assessment: Correct Punctuation and Verb Voice and Mood (see Assessment Overview and Resources)

- Ensure there is a copy of Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 5, along with students’ Module 3 End of Unit 2 Assessments with feedback, at each student’s workspace.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous modules to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Return students’ **Module 3 End of Unit 2 Assessments with feedback**.

- Using a preferred classroom routine, collect or review the answers to **Homework: Selected and Constructed Response Questions: Punctuation** from Lesson 4. Refer to the **Homework: Selected and Constructed Response Questions: Punctuation (answers for teacher reference)**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Mid-Unit 3 Assessment: Language Assessment: Correct Punctuation and Verb Voice and Mood (20 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can use punctuation to indicate a pause or an omission.”

“I can use verbs correctly.”

- Distribute **Mid-Unit 3 Assessment: Language Assessment: Correct Punctuation and Verb Voice and Mood**.

- Remind students that they analyzed punctuation, voice, and mood through selected and constructed response questions in previous lessons.

- Read aloud the directions for the assessment as students follow along silently. Answer clarifying questions.

- Direct students’ attention to the following resources:

- **Strategies to Answer Selected Response Questions anchor chart**

- Invite students to Think-Pair-Share to review these support documents:

“What strategies do you use when you are completing selected response questions?” (Answers will vary, but might include I think back to the text or I cross out answers that I know are incorrect.)

- Remind students to refer to these materials as they answer the assessment questions.

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence.

- Invite students to begin the assessment. While they are taking the assessment, circulate to monitor and document their test-taking skills.

- Collect assessments.

For Lighter Support

- Before the assessment, underline key vocabulary in the assessment directions and prompt and read aloud together as a class to ensure that students understand each task included in the assessment. Invite students who need lighter support to restate or clarify information for students who need heavier support. Review key terms (*comma*, *dash*, *ellipsis*, *voice*, *mood*) aloud and provide a glossary of terms that students can refer back to as needed to help them stay grounded while answering the questions on the assessment.

For Heavier Support

- Display a “map” of the assessment to reference while explaining directions to the mid-unit assessment. This will reduce ambiguity and give students a clearer picture of what they can expect so that they can better allocate their time and attentional resources. Provide students with colored pencils or highlighters so that they can mark up the map as needed. Example:

- Read the text reflection. Then, answer the questions.

- Questions 1–2: Answer constructed response questions about using commas and dashes to indicate a pause.

- Questions 3–4: Answer selected and constructed response questions about using ellipses to omit information in a quotation.

- Questions 5–6: Answer selected and constructed response questions about verb voice and mood.

Closing and Assessment

A. Share Independent Research Reading – RI.8.10 (20 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to guide students to share their independent research reading, reminding students that the purpose of research reading is to build their content knowledge, domain-specific vocabulary, and achievement on reading complex texts. As necessary, use the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart** to review integrity.

- Refer to the **Independent Reading Sample Plans** to guide students through a research reading share or use a different routine.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- After the assessment, ask students to write or discuss which assessment task was easiest and which was most difficult and why. In future lessons and for homework, focus on the language skills that help students address these assessment challenges.

For Heavier Support

- Provide students with a sheet of paper on which they can use a selected a color, number, or symbol to self-assess against each learning target in private. This provides useful data for future instruction and helps students monitor their own learning.

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
