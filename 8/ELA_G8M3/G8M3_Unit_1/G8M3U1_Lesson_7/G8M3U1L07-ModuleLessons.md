Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Work Time B: Students answer questions about how dialogue, word choice, and tone reveal aspects of character in chapter 4 of *Maus I* for the mid-unit assessment (RL.8.1, RL.8.3, RL.8.4, RL.8.10, L.8.4).

- RL.8.2 – Closing and Assessment A: Students track the gist, plot, character and emerging theme of chapter 4 of *Maus I*.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Add additional dialogue, word choice, and tone selected or constructed response questions to the assessment for students who finish early.

- In Closing and Assessment A, ask students to find specific examples from the text that support the character and themes they track. As time allows, have students select examples for their peers to connect to the information tracked.

- Invite students to predict what they think will happen next in chapter 5 of *Maus I*. Students can record their predictions and track them as they preread this section of the text for homework.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the first half of this unit, students analyzed how dialogue, word choice, and tone reveal aspects of character in *Maus I*. Students will independently answer questions about aspects of character in chapter 4 of *Maus I*.

- Students will also continue to track the gist, plot, character, and emerging theme of *Maus I* through an analysis of chapter 4.

Support All Students

- Note that chapter 4 of *Maus I* brings up potentially sensitive topics such as a public hanging. Allow for time to process and respond to this topic during individual, small group, or full class discussion, and reach out to families as needed. Use thoughtful strategic pairing for discussions around these topics to ensure that all students feel comfortable.

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment.

- For some students, this assessment may require more than the 20 minutes allotted. Consider providing time over multiple days if necessary.

- To support ELLs, this lesson includes supported in-class reading of the text and a Mid-Unit 1 Assessment that contains questions that closely mirror the text-dependent questions students have done practice with in Lessons 4, 5, and 6. Students will demonstrate their knowledge of how the meaning of words contributes to tone and of how dialogue and incidents in the story reveal aspects or character and propel the action. In Closing and Assessment A of the lesson, students will continue to track emerging themes in preparation for the End of Unit 1 Assessment in Lesson 10.

- ELLs may find it challenging to read *Maus I*, chapter 4, and complete the assessment independently. The depth and volume of both the content students will read and the assessment questions will require strong focus from students. Support ELLs by encouraging them to apply familiar reading and test-taking strategies. Review where the book left off after chapter 3 to activate students prior knowledge, enabling them to jump back into the story with ease.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.C.11 and 8.I.C.12.

Assessment Guidance

- All assessment Materials (student prompt and teacher checklist) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback on this assessment, use the answer key and sample student responses (see Assessment Overview and Resources).

- Check student vocabulary logs for accountability in recording vocabulary.

- Check gist statements to ensure students are recording quick notes about what the text is mostly about.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue tracking gist, plot, character, and emerging theme as they read *Maus I* and analyze a whole-book summary in preparation for writing a whole-book summary of *Maus I* for their end of unit assessment.

- Students’ Mid-Unit 1 Assessments will be returned in Lesson 10 with feedback.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Return students’ **Module 2 End of Unit 3 Assessments with feedback**.

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 7**. This entrance ticket prompts students to review their feedback from the Module 2 End of Unit 3 Assessment. Invite students to spend a few minutes reading the feedback and then fill out the reflection questions on the entrance ticket. If they require support to understand the feedback, encourage them to write their names on the board for a one-on-one review. Remind students that everyone is working toward individual goals and that learning is about continued growth and development.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read *Maus I*, Chapter 4 (10 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same process as with previous lessons for students to read chapter 4 of ***Maus I***. Since this is an assessment, instruct students to read the pages independently. Remind students that they can refer to their **Holocaust Glossary** if they encounter domain-specific vocabulary they do not understand. Then have students identify the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary, reflect on their reading as they choose, and record the gist on **sticky notes** using the following resources as appropriate: **vocabulary logs** and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart.**

- Gist: Jewish people hide but are ultimately sent to Auschwitz, a concentration camp where Nazis gas Jews to death.

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What examples of habits of character were evident in chapter 4 of *Maus I*?” (Students may mention many examples and answers will vary, but may note how Vladek showed perseverance as he worked to earn money and use that money to keep himself alive.)

“What habits of character did you practice while reading and discussing chapter 4 of *Maus I*?” (Answers will vary, but may include that they practiced using compassion as they worried about the survival of Vladek and other Jewish people and respect as they deepened their understanding of the inhumane experiences Jewish people endured during the Holocaust.)

Work Time

B. Mid-Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Character, Dialogue, and Word Choice: *Maus I*, Chapter 4 – RL.8.3 (20 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze how dialogue between characters and incidents in *Maus I* reveal aspects of character or provoke a decision.”

“I can analyze how specific word choices impact meaning and tone in *Maus I*.”

- Distribute **Mid-Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Character, Dialogue, and Word Choice: *Maus I***, **Chapter 4**, and invite students to take out their copies of *Maus I*.

- Remind students that they analyzed how dialogue, word choice, and tone reveal aspects of character in previous lessons, and will be assessed on their understanding of this through independent analysis.

- Read aloud the directions for each part of the assessment as students follow along silently. Answer clarifying questions.

- Direct students’ attention to the following resources:

- **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart**

- **Strategies to Answer Selected Response Questions anchor chart**

- Invite students to Think-Pair-Share about these support documents:

“In what ways can the Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart support you in an assessment?” (Responses will vary but could include that the anchor chart reminds us of the skills we’ve built as readers and we can apply them to an assessment.)

“What strategies do you use when you are completed selected response questions?” (Answers will vary, but might include I think back to the text or I cross out answers that I know are incorrect.)

- Remind students to refer to these materials as they answer the assessment questions.

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence.

- Invite students to begin the assessment. While they are taking the assessment, circulate to monitor and document their test-taking skills.

- Collect assessments.

For Lighter Support

- Before the assessment of Work Time B, underline key vocabulary in the assessment directions and prompt and read aloud together as a class to ensure that students understand each task included in the assessment. Invite students who need lighter support to restate or clarify information for students who need heavier support. Review key terms (*tone*, *dialogue*, *character*, *incident*, *action*) aloud and provide a glossary of terms that students can refer back to as needed to help them stay grounded while answering the questions on the assessment.

For Heavier Support

- Display a “map” of the assessment to reference while explaining directions to the mid-unit assessment. This will reduce ambiguity and give students a clearer picture of what they can expect so that they can better allocate their time and attentional resources. Provide students with colored pencils or highlighters so that they can mark up the map as needed. Example:

- Read *Maus I* Chapter 4. Then answer the questions.

- Questions 1–3: Answer selected response questions about tone in dialogue.

- Questions 4–6: Answer selected and constructed response questions about how dialogue and incidents in the story reveal aspects of character and propel the action forward.

- Question 7: Write a short paragraph, with evidence, explaining how the words within a statement inform tone and how the statement reveals aspects of a character.

Closing and Assessment

A. Track Gist, Plot, Character, and Emerging Theme: *Maus I*, Chapter 4 – RL.8.2 (10 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can track characters, plot, and emerging themes in order to track the development of theme in *Maus I*.”

- Distribute **Synopsis: *Maus I***, **Chapter 4** to students as needed.

- Display the **Gist, Plot, Character and Emerging Theme anchor chart**.

- Prompt students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What is the gist of chapter 4?”

“What are the key events that happened in the plot in *Maus I*, chapter 4?”

“What have we learned about the development of characters in this chapter?”

“Yesterday, we began to discuss some emerging themes around perseverance and the will to survive, family ties, and the importance of remembering. Based on what we learned today, how might we add to or revise these emerging themes?”

- Cold-call students to share out and add to the key plot elements section of the anchor chart. Refer to the **Gist, Plot, Character, and Emerging Theme anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** as needed, and clarify any misconceptions.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Homework

A. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread chapter 5 in *Maus I* in preparation for reading the chapter in the next lesson.

B. Analyze Voice

- Students complete **Homework: Selected and Constructed Response Questions: Analyze Voice: *Maus I***, **Chapter 5** to answer questions about active and passive voice.
