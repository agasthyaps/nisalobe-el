5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

RL.8.4, L.8.1b, L.8.3a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

Housing and abundant food **will be supplied**. (from page 54, panel 7 of *Maus I* by Art Spiegelman)

**Lesson 6 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive during Work Time A after students have read chapter 3 of *Maus I*.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target **(I can analyze how specific word choices impact meaning and tone)** and RL.8.4 by providing an opportunity for students to analyze the impact of specific word choices on meaning and tone. This sentence also helps students to address L.8.1b and L.8.3a because it uses a verb in the passive voice to achieve the effect of emphasizing an action, by drawing focus to the object of the verb.

- Supporting Standard: L.8.6.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses a verb in passive voice, which draws the reader’s attention to the object of the verb and emphasizes the action being carried out.

- Transfer: **be** + \[verb + **-ed**\] used in Part I selected response questions on the End of Unit 1 Assessment and in summary writing throughout this unit.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **Housing and abundant food <u>will be supplied</u>**.

- Ask:

“What is this sentence about?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **will be supplied**

- Ask:

“What do you notice about this verb phrase?” (Responses will vary, but may include that it’s a future tense verb phrase written in passive voice. We know this because of the construction, be + \[verb + -ed\].)

“What will be supplied?” (Housing and abundant food.)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **Housing and abundant food <u>will be supplied</u>**.

- Ask:

“Who will supply the housing and abundant food? In other words, who is the implied doer or agent of the action in this sentence?” (Students may have to return to the text to see that this sentence refers to the Nazis.)

“How could this sentence be written in active voice, to include this agent as the subject?” (The Nazis will supply housing and abundant food.)

“How does the tone of the sentence change when it’s written using a verb in active voice? Why?” (While in passive voice, the sentence has a warm and inviting tone because of the emphasis on housing and abundant food; the sentence in active voice has a very matter of fact, straightforward tone. In active voice, the emphasis is on the subject, the Nazis, rather than on the appealing outcome and result being offered.

“Can you figure out why Art Spiegelman would write this sentence using a verb in passive voice? Remember, this sentence appears on a sign that represents how the Nazis communicated with Jewish people and prisoners of war.” (To emphasize the object of the verb, housing and abundant food, which are appealing things to receive. They are trying to persuade the war prisoners to join work camps by making it sound appealing.)

“How can we use verbs in passive voice to achieve particular effects in our own speaking or writing?” (To shift the emphasis of a sentence from the subject to the object to highlight a result or outcome.)

- Ask:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target:  
‘I can analyze how specific word choices impact meaning and tone’?”(Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

> **German workers will be replaced by prisoners of war.**
>
> .

subject + future tense verb + object

- Say:

“Rewrite the sentence from passive to active voice to shift the emphasis from the people being replaced (object) to the agent carrying out the action (subject).”

- As time allows, encourage students to discuss how the meaning and tone of the sentence changes when the sentence is rewritten with a verb in active voice. (When the emphasis is shifted to the subject, **prisoners of war**, the meaning and tone is that these prisoners are actively replacing the workers and it seems like it’s happening voluntarily. In passive voice, the action seems unintentional, suggesting the prisoners have no choice.)

- Possible student answers:

> **<u>Prisoners of war will replace German workers.</u>**

subject + future tense verb + object
