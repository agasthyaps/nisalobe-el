37. How would you describe the tone the author’s words create on page 64, panel 4, when Vladek says: “I’m trying to get to Sosnowejec—back to my family.” What does this reveal about Vladek’s character? What evidence makes you think so? (RL8.1, RL8.3, RL8.4)

In your response, be sure to include

- a description of the tone that Vladek’s statement creates,

- evidence from the text that supports your description of Vladek’s tone,

- and an explanation of what the statement reveals about Vladek’s character.

Vladek’s statement creates an urgent tone and conveys a sense of his resourcefulness. Vladek is trying to convince the train conductor that although he doesn’t have the proper papers, he should have access to the train. He does this by appealing on the conductor’s emotions—telling him he was in captivity and speaking badly of their common enemy (the Germans). This suggests that he is desperate to get home, yet resourceful in his approach. The last part of the statement, “back to my family,” makes it clear that he is trying to appeal to the conductor’s emotions. This urgent tone reveals that although Vladek is scared and anxious about getting on the train without papers, he is resourceful and uses agency to get his desired result.
