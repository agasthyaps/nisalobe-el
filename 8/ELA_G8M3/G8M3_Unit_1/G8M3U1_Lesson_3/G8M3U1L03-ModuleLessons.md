Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- L.8.4c – Work Time A: Students use the Holocaust Glossary to build background knowledge as they review and discuss the meaning of important terms related to the Holocaust in their Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol.

- RI.8.4 – Work Time B: Students identify unknown words and phrases as they read an overview of the Holocaust and determine meanings.

- L.8.4c – Work Time B: Students consult the Holocaust Glossary to determine or clarify the precise meaning of unknown words or phrases.

- SL.8.1 – Closing and Assessment A: Student engage in collaborative discussion with peers to share their learning.

- In Work Time A, students participate in a reading of “The Holocaust: An Introductory History.” During this reading, students focus on determining the meaning of unknown words and phrases. “The Holocaust: An Introductory History” note-catcher provides vocabulary for students to look up using their Holocaust Glossary and thinking questions for students to reflect upon. Continue to use discussion protocols (e.g., Think-Pair-Share, Conversation Cues, and total participation techniques) to engage all students in a collaborative discussion about the text.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become ethical people by showing respect as they reflect on the events of the Holocaust and working to become effective learners by collaborating as they work in pairs throughout the lesson.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Invite students to research more about the Holocaust and to ask their family members what they know about this time period. Students can share what they learn through these interviews in small groups or with the whole class.

- Invite students to research World War I and the Treaty of Versailles to better understand the historical context for the rise of the Nazi party. Students can share what they learn through these interviews in small groups or with the whole class.

- Invite students to write a summary paragraph of “The Holocaust: An Introductory History.” Students can share these summaries with classmates and discuss the key events that are included.

- The Grade 9 and 10 L.4 standard also requires students to look up the etymology of words. Invite students to choose words from the Holocaust Glossary and find their etymology. Consider extending this work further by providing students with a list of questions they can use to further explore meaning and how the historical and present-day uses of the word connect or differ:

- When was the word first used?

- Who uses this word today? Why do they use this word?

- How does the word make you feel when you hear it?

- What are other similar words or phrases that could be used to convey the same meaning?

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous two lessons, students discovered the module topic, Voices of the Holocaust, and were introduced to their anchor text, a graphic novel about the Holocaust. Today, they will deepen their knowledge by participating in a reading of a nonfiction text that gives an overview of the Holocaust and its gravity and exploring a glossary to determine the meaning of unknown words and phrases.

Support All Students

- Presenting learning targets in writing, orally, and if possible, accompanied by symbols will help students to understand the language within them. ▲

- In Work Time A, students will read and interact with various terms related to the Holocaust. The pronunciation of these terms could be challenging for some students. Consider providing time for students to clarify pronunciation of terms before participating in the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol. ▲

- Students might benefit from a model of the exchange of information that will take place in the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol. Consider guiding one pair through the protocol as an example prior to releasing the group into the activity.

- Note that “The Holocaust: An Introductory History” brings up potentially sensitive topics such as the Final Solution, the Nazi party, propaganda, anti-Semitism, the master race, Kristallnacht, ghettos, death camps, concentration camps, and displaced persons. Some students and their families may find these topics to be upsetting or in conflict with their values. Allow for time to process and respond to these topics during individual, small group, or full class discussion, and reach out to families as needed.

- Pair students (especially ELLs) thoughtfully for pair share to build supportive and safe exchange. Vary these partners throughout the unit to expose students to diverse perspectives one-on-one. ▲

- Students may need additional support in processing oral questions during the reading. Allow time for students to think and/or write before sharing orally. Incorporate a mix of processing techniques after reading, including written reflections and small group and whole-class discussion. ▲

- Students may need additional support with recording their answers on their note-catchers. Consider sitting those students in a group together for additional support when necessary. ▲

- Students may need additional time to read and process “The Holocaust: An Introductory History.” Consider executing this lesson over two class periods, rather than one, to allow more time for reading and oral processing, as well as more practice with new domain-specific vocabulary.

- To support ELLs, this lesson includes a supported reading of an informational text on the Holocaust to help students continue to build background knowledge of the topic. Students are introduced to a Holocaust Glossary, which will serve as a reference for important events, dates, and people throughout the module. The lesson also includes collaborative discussion in a Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol and during a pair share in which students review their learning in the lesson.

- ELLs may find it challenging to understand the informational text during the guided reading if they do not have previous knowledge of the Holocaust. Encourage students to annotate their copy of the text as they read, noting places where they might want to return to build further understanding of information. ELLs may also need support in navigating the discussions within the lesson. Use Conversation Cues and sentence starters as needed to help students with these exchanges.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.B.6 and 8.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ “The Holocaust: An Introductory History” note-catchers to ensure students understand the new vocabulary and thinking questions.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a close reading of the first chapter of *Maus I*, their anchor text.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare

- Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 3

- Holocaust Glossary

- Holocaust Glossary Strips

- Strategically group students into pairs for the work in this lesson.

- Preview “The Holocaust: An Introductory History” note-catcher (example for teacher reference) to become familiar with what is required of students.

- Ensure there is a copy of Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 3 at each student’s workspace.

- Prepare the Holocaust Glossary Strips by cutting enough strips for each student to have one strip for use in Work Time A.

- Review the steps of the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol for use in Work Time A.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time B: Convert note-catchers and invite students to complete them in an online format—for example, http://eled.org/0158.

- Work Time B: For students who will benefit from hearing the texts read aloud multiple times, use a text-to-speech tool such as http://eled.org/0103. Note that to use a web-based text-to-speech tool, an online doc will need to be created—for example, http://eled.org/0158, containing the text. ▲

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous modules to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 3**.

- Prompt students to Turn and Talk about their answers to the entrance ticket. Cold Call students to share out.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Introduce the Holocaust Glossary – L.8.4c (10 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can deepen my understanding of the Holocaust by determining the meaning of words and phrases using a glossary.”

- Direct students to look at the back cover of their anchor text, ***Maus I***, and display a copy for all students to see. Point to where it says “WWII, Poland.” Ask students to view the map, reading the place names and countries.

- Tell students that this book relays Vladek’s experience in Poland during the Holocaust as told by his son Art.

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What background knowledge do you have about World War II or the Holocaust?” (Answers will vary based on experience.)

- Tell students that they will have the opportunity to build their background knowledge about World War II and the Holocaust as they participate in a new protocol.

- Pass out one of the **Holocaust Glossary Strips** to each student. Direct students to read the word and definition on their strip, underlining important keywords that help them understand the information given. Tell students that it is ok if they still have questions about vocabulary or the meaning of their word.

- Once students have finished reading and annotating their strip, lead them through the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol, using the following directions and using as many rounds as time permits.

- Ask students to review the definition strip from the Holocaust Glossary Strips they received and put the key information from the term they were given into their own words.

- Invite students to find a partner and stand back-to-back with him or her, being respectful of space.

- Ask:

“What is your word, and what is your understanding of its meaning?”

Have students think about what their word means, how they annotated the meaning, how they want to share, and how they might best express themselves.

- Say, “face-to-face,” and have students turn, face their partners, and decide who will share first if it has not been indicated that a certain person should go first.

- Have each student share the definition in their own words, including key learning and important takeaways from the term they were given. Prompt students to listen carefully when their partner is speaking, and be sure to make eye contact with him or her.

- When given the signal, students should find a new partner, stand back-to-back, and wait for the signal “face-to-face” before sharing their definition and takeaways with their new partner.

- Repeat this process, discussing as many terms and meeting with as many partners as time permits.

- If productive, use a Goal 4 Conversation Cue to encourage students to add on to what a classmate said:

“Who can add on to what your classmate said? I’ll give you time to think.”

- Gather students back together, and pass out the **Holocaust Glossary**. Have students mark the terms they shared and learned in the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol, and direct them to save the glossary as a resource for future learning in the unit.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- In advance of Work Time A, highlight or underline potentially unfamiliar words and phrases in individual copies of the text to draw students’ attention to this language. If time allows, dedicate time to talking through each of these together as a class or pair students with supportive peers to interpret meaning in small group discussions.

For Heavier Support

- After Work Time A, for continued practice with L.8.5b, invite students to identify one example of a cause and effect relationship expressed in a sentence within the text to share with the class. As time allows, guide the discussion toward considering how individual words and phrases and the language structures within each example convey cause and effect.

Work Time

B. Read “The Holocaust: An Introductory History” – RI.8.4 (25 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can deepen my understanding of the Holocaust by determining the meaning of words and phrases using a glossary.”

- Invite students to work in pairs. Direct students’ attention to the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**, and review what *collaboration* looks and sounds like.

- Display and distribute **“The Holocaust: An Introductory History.”** Display and distribute **“The Holocaust: An Introductory History” note-catcher.**

- Read aloud the first paragraph of the text titled “Introduction” as students read silently.

- Invite students to use their Holocaust Glossary to look up the meaning of domain-specific vocabulary that they do not know.

- Invite students to read “Central Idea” and “Think about It” on their note-catcher aloud with a partner and then Turn and Talk.

- Give students a moment to jot down their thoughts, and then call on one pair to briefly share out. Refer to “The Holocaust: An Introductory History” note-catcher (example for teacher reference) for answers.

- Allocate each pair a section of the text as outlined by the remaining sections on the note-catcher to read and use their note-catcher to analyze. Ensure all sections of the text are represented across the class.

- Invite students to begin reading and analyzing their section of text. Circulate to support students in reading and analyzing their section.

- After 10 minutes invite pairs to begin to circulate to look for a pair who have worked on other sections of the text. Direct them to share their analyses of their sections and to update their note-catchers accordingly. Once both pairs have shared, they are to look for another pair who worked on a different section to repeat the sharing process.

- Invite students to keep circulating until they have completed all sections on their note-catchers.

- Ask students to Turn and Talk with a partner, sharing their collaboration successes and challenges from their work in Work Time B.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Closing and Assessment

A. Pair Share: Build Background Knowledge – SL.8.1 (5 minutes)

- Prompt students to find a partner they did not meet with during the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol.

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share about the following questions, marking any new learning on their Holocaust Glossary:

“What are two terms you learned about in the Back-to-Back, Face-to-Face or during your reading? Share these terms with your partner.” (Answers will vary.)

“What are two terms you want to learn more about as we dig deeper into our learning about the Holocaust?” (Answers will vary.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Homework

A. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread *Maus I*, chapter 1 in preparation for studying this chapter in the next lesson.
