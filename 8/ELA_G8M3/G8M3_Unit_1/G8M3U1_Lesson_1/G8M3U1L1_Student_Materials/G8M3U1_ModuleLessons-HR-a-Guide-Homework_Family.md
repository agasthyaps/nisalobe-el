![](media/image1.png) Guiding Questions and Big Ideas

What was the Holocaust, and how did it occur? Why do we remember it?

- *The Holocaust was the systematic persecution of 6 million Jewish people by the Nazi regime during World War II.*

- *We remember the Holocaust because painful experiences shape us and teach us so that history does not repeat itself.*

What will your student be doing at school?

Throughout this unit, your child will engage in a variety of experiences that grow their understanding of the Holocaust and increase their literacy skills. As readers, students must build a robust toolbox to help them analyze, understand, and enjoy texts. Students in Grade 8 pay attention to various literary devices and components in the texts they read, and classroom instruction is aligned to support their fluency with these components. Some of these experiences and literacy components are outlined below.

**Read an Anchor Text— *Maus I*:** Each module is grounded in an anchor text. For this module, students will read the text *Maus I: A Survivor’s Tale: My Father Bleeds History*. *Maus I* is a graphic novel, written in 1980. It depicts the author, Art Spiegelman, interviewing his father, Vladek, about his experiences as a Polish Jew and Holocaust survivor. As Art illustrates his father’s experiences, a parallel plot of Art and Vladek’s relationship is developed.

**Explore Tone and Dialogue:** As students read *Maus I*, they analyze the dialogue within the text and explore how dialogue and tone reveal aspects of the characters.

**Dialogue** is a conversation between characters in a text, and the use of dialogue often highlights the relationship between characters. The way a character speaks reveals aspects of their opinions, thoughts, perspectives, and helps to set a tone in the text.

- Example of dialogue and what it reveals aspects of characters are noted below:

- Vladek says, “I had to quit school at about 14 to work . . . but I took private lessons . . . I always dreamed of going to America.” This reveals that he is hardworking.

- Vladek says, “For my condition, I must fight to save myself. Doctors, they only give me junk food.” This reveals that he acts with agency and makes choices to help himself.

**Tone** is the perspective or attitude that the author adopts with regards to a specific character, place, or development. The tone can also be revealed through dialogue:

- Some examples of tone in a text are confident, proud, sarcastic, cheerful, and pessimistic.

- When Vladek is speaking to his ill wife, he says, “He told me you are doing fine . . . fine. Just relax.” This creates a soothing tone.

**Track Emerging Theme(s):** In addition to looking at tone and dialogue, students also begin to examine the themes in *Maus I*.

- **Theme** is the underlying meaning, or message, the author is trying to convey that is uncovered by the plot of a text. Themes can be varied and/or hidden and tend to be more universal in nature. Through examining them, students develop a deeper understanding of the text.

- Some examples of themes in *Maus I* concern perseverance, agency, the will to survive, and family ties:

- Humans have an amazing ability to persevere through extremely challenging events and oppression.

- Humans care about having their family stay alive and stay together.

**Write Summaries:** In the second half of the unit, students learn to write a summary of an entire text by first analyzing a whole-book summary and then practicing writing summaries of their own. Students learn that an effective summary

- gives an introduction to the text stating the title and author,

- explains the central idea of the text,

- includes a brief synthesis of the main events of the text,

- makes a statement of theme (the point or message the author wants you to take away), evident in the text,

- wraps up with a concluding statement, and

- is short, clear, and concise.

An example of a **whole-book summary** that meets the criteria listed is below:

In *Summer of the Mariposas* by Guadalupe Garcia McCall, Odilia Garza and her four sisters set out on a journey from Texas to Mexico and back again. Along the way, they encounter many magical adventures and learn many life lessons through challenges and struggle. At the beginning of the story, we meet the Garza sisters, who live in Texas with their mother, who works long hours. The girls mostly look after themselves and each other. When the sisters find a dead body in a river, they decide to drive to Mexico, determined to find the dead man’s family and to visit their grandmother. As their journey unfolds, the girls encounter many supernatural creatures, including La Llorona, a witch, a warlock, half-human barn owls, and chupacabras, all of which connect to myths from Latin American folklore. The most important of these is La Llorona, who helps Odilia and the girls throughout the story when they are in danger. Early in the book, La Llorona gives Odilia a magical earring that keeps her and her sisters from danger. Eventually, Odilia and her sisters reach their grandmother’s house and rest before returning home. When they arrive back in Texas, exhausted, their father is there and things are tense and difficult for the family. The girls are quite upset to learn that their father wants their mother to move out of their home so he can live there with his new wife and her children with Odilia and her sisters. Throughout the novel, the theme of maternal love is emphasized through Odilia’s relationship with La Llorona, who watches over the Garza sisters like a mother. In the end, the story and La Llorona’s message remind us of the strength of a mother’s love and protection. This reminds us that if are kind and to do things with a pure heart, we will be safe.

The reading and writing skills students develop in the ten lessons in Unit 1 prepare them for the mid-unit assessment, where they will independently analyze dialogue, tone, and incidents in the text and for their end of unit assessment, where they write a whole-book summary.

**Habits of Character:** In addition to their academic learning, the EL Education curriculum focuses on “habits of character” and social-emotional learning. With this in mind, students work on various habits of character throughout the curriculum:

- Work to Become Effective Learners—developing mindsets and skills for success in college, career, and life (e.g., initiative, responsibility, perseverance, collaboration)

- Work to Become Ethical People—treating others well and standing up for what is right (e.g., empathy, integrity, respect, compassion)

- Work to Contribute to a Better World—putting their learning to use to improve communities (e.g., citizenship, service)

Working to become ethical people is the habit of character emphasized in this unit. These are the specific skills students will focus on:

- I show empathy. This means I understand and share or take into account the feelings, situation, or attitude of others. In this unit, students focus on showing empathy as they read and think about the challenges people faced during the Holocaust.

- I show respect. This means I appreciate the abilities, qualities, and achievements of others and treat myself, others, and the environment with care. In this unit, students focus on showing respect as they read texts that bring up sensitive topics such as anti-Semitism, concentration camps, death, and persecution and as they reflect on the events of the Holocaust.

- I show compassion. This means I notice when others are sad or upset and try to help them. Students work to build awareness of their peers’ emotions and reactions to the challenging and sensitive topics from the Holocaust they are reading, thinking, talking, and writing about in this unit.

How can you support your student at home?

Talk to your student about the guiding questions, particularly if any of the topics raised might be sensitive for your student or family.

Talk to your student about the texts he or she is reading in the classroom, particularly if any of the topics raised might be sensitive for your student.

Reach out to teachers if you have any questions or concerns about the text.

Talk to your student about the Holocaust. Discuss other examples of genocides in history and in modern day.

Watch films and research on the internet with your student to find out more about the Holocaust. Build background knowledge on this topic by discovering together the details of this time period and its lasting effects.

Read informational books and articles with your student, and discuss. What important events did you learn about? How did these events impact the individuals?

Unit 1: Homework

Students engage in two kinds of reading for homework, with choice reading as an additional option.

**Anchor text reading:** Students preread chapters of the anchor text, *Maus I*, to prepare for the next lesson. They also reread the chapters of the text read in class and answer questions about it.

**Independent Research Reading:** When not reading their anchor text, your student is expected to independently research the topic. In the first lesson, students complete both types of reading as both independent research reading and the anchor text are introduced. When not assigned readings in the anchor text, students read topic-related books of their choice for approximately 20 minutes <u>each day</u> and respond to a prompt of choice in the <u>front</u> of the independent reading journal. These are usually books your student will bring home from school; however, they may be topic-related books chosen by your student at the public or your home library. Prompts for independent reading can be found in the homework materials provided.

**Choice reading:** If your student would also like to independently read and respond to a book of free choice, he or she may use the <u>back</u> of the independent reading journal. Prompts for independent reading can be found in the homework materials provided.

Independent Research Reading

**Directions:** Remember to record responses to research reading in the front of your independent reading journal and responses to choice reading in the back. Try to choose a different prompt each time.

Record any new vocabulary in your vocabulary log. Underline vocabulary found during independent reading.

**Record:**

- Date

- Title and author of your reading book

- Pages you have read

- Prompt

- Response

**Example:**

<u>Date:</u> 1/13/2020

<u>Book Title and Author:</u> *Maus I* by Art Spiegelman

<u>Pages Read:</u> 11–23

<u>Prompt:</u> Summarize your research reading today in no more than five sentences.

<u>Response:</u> In Chapter 1 of *Maus I*, Art, the narrator, goes to visit his father, a Holocaust survivor named Vladek. Vladek has aged after two heart attacks and his wife’s suicide, and Art wants to hear his story of the Holocaust. As Vladek pedals on his on his bicycle while talking to Art, Vladek tells Art about how he had a girlfriend before Art’s mother but decided he wanted to marry Anja after meeting her and investigating her family and eligibility. Afterwards, he asks Art not to publish these private details.

**Consider using the following independent reading prompts.**[^1]

- How does this text add to your understanding of one of the guiding questions of the module?

- Which habits of character are demonstrated in the text? Explain.

- What is the central idea or theme of the text? How was this idea developed?

- Record two or three facts in your own words that you learned from the text.

- Summarize your research reading today in no more than five sentences.

- What major ideas are present in the text you read? Give text details that convey those details.

- What questions do you have about the topic after reading?

- Choose one new word from your reading today and analyze it on a vocabulary square.

|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Definition in your own words**                  | **Synonyms** (words with the same meaning) |
| **Words with the same affix or root**             | **Sketch**                                 |
| **Translation in home language** (if appropriate) |                                            |

Vocabulary

**Directions:** In the classroom, you have been recording words from your texts in your vocabulary log. Throughout this unit, you have been research reading topic-related books at home to build your knowledge of the Holocaust and recording words in your independent reading journal.

Choose a word from your research reading or from a text you’ve read in class and add the word to your vocabulary log. Try to choose a different word to add and to practice a different vocabulary strategy each time. For each word, be sure to add the following:

1.  The definition, or meaning, of the word

<!-- -->

5.  The vocabulary strategy you used to figure out the meaning of the word

6.  A sketch or diagram that helps you to better understand the meaning of the word

Record new vocabulary in vocabulary logs and mark academic vocabulary with a symbol, for example a star:

- Academic vocabulary: words you might find in informational texts on many different topics. For example, the words *evidence* and *rationale* are words that could be found in books on any topic.

- Domain-specific vocabulary: words about a particular topic. For example, the words *tadpoles*, *frogspawn*, and *amphibian* are some that would be found on the topic of frogs.

**Vocabulary Strategies**

As a reminder, the vocabulary strategies we’ve been working on in class are listed below:

- Context: Read the sentence around the word.

- Look at the affixes for clues.

- Look at the root of the word for clues.

- Use a dictionary.

- Discuss the word with another person (after attempting some of the above strategies).

[^1]: Some of the prompts will not be appropriate for the text students are reading. Invite students to choose a prompt that works for the text they have just read.
