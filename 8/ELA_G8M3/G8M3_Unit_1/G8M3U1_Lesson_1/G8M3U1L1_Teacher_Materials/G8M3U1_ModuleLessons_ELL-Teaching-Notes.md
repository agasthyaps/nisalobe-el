English Language Learners: Grade 8: Module 3: Unit 1: Teaching Notes

The Holocaust: Build Background Knowledge

Teaching Notes for Unit 1

Prioritize Lessons for Classrooms with Many ELLs

During the End of Unit 1 Assessment, students write a whole-book summary of *Maus I* and answer questions about **CCSS** Language sub-standards (**L.8.1b**, **L.8.3a**) focused on the form and function of active and passive voice. Throughout the module, students have the opportunity to participate in Language Dives and optional Mini Language Dives that draw attention to how active and passive voice are constructed and used to achieve particular effects. Prioritize this work to help ELLs build a deep understanding of sentence structure to set them up for success in answering selected and constructed response questions and in writing their summaries on the End of Unit Assessment.

Language Dives

In Lesson 5, students participate in a Language Dive. This Language Dive invites students to analyze a sentence from chapter 2 of *Maus I*. Students explore how a particular line of dialogue propels the action in the story and consider how passive voice is used to emphasize the result of an action.

Be aware that in Module 3, Language Dive goals remain the same: to empower students to analyze, understand, and use the language of academic sentences; however, beginning in this unit, and continuing throughout Modules 3 and 4, the Language Dive Guide has been modified. The modified format follows the Deconstruct, Reconstruct, and Practice routine, which should seem familiar as a general process (see Language Dives in Online Resources). Modules 3 and 4 go beyond the process of Modules 1 and 2 by providing options for questions and activities that continue to teach students how English works. Thus, this modified format attempts to encourage students to take more of the lead in the conversation and build greater independence by taking an inquiry-based approach to language in general, and the selected sentence in particular. Although students should briefly discuss all chunks in each Language Dive sentence, the new format invites them to slow down during one chunk, called the focus structure, to investigate and practice a particularly compelling language structure. For more context, review the full Language Dive Guide in Lesson 5 of this unit, as well as a range of questions students might ask one another in Questions We Can Ask During a Language Dive anchor chart in the Online Resources.

Mini Language Dives

Students have an opportunity to participate in Mini Language Dives beginning in Module 2, Unit 1. Mini Language Dives have the same overall purpose and follow the same general process as full Language Dives, but are condensed to 5 minutes, narrowing students’ attention on deconstructing the focus structure, reconstructing the sentence, and practicing the focus structure. Mini Language Dives give ELLs additional support in building language and literacy skills, as well as habits of mind. Mini Language Dives are most often optional and can be found in the corresponding lessons within this guide. When required for all students, Mini Language Dives are built into the body of the lesson in the Teacher Guide. In this guide, optional Mini Language Dives appear in Lessons 4 and 6 to provide additional practice with active and passive voice (**L.8.1b**, **L.8.3a**). The Mini Language Dive in Lesson 4 also focuses on **RL.8.4** and the meaning of figurative language. Lesson 9 includes a Mini Language Dive within Opening B for further practice with using active and passive voice (**L.8.1b**, **L.8.3a**).

Diversity and Inclusion

Investigate the routines, practices, rituals, beliefs, norms, and experiences that are important to ELLs and their families. Integrate this background into the classroom as students explore the Holocaust. Be mindful, especially, of potentially sensitive social, ethnic, racial, and existential content in this module as students explore the tragedies of this time in history. Note that the anchor text, *Maus I*, includes dialogue that incorporates a variety of English with which students may be unfamiliar. Acknowledge that while some of the speech used by the character Vladek may not align with the classroom variety of English students are being asked to use, his dialect is a valid and authentic example of how many ELLs produce language. Celebrate diversity in language use, and encourage students to approach language descriptively while reading the text and analyzing and discussing dialogue.

Be mindful of ELLs’ formal schooling experiences, degree of home- and English-language development, length of time in the United States and in US schools, and family backgrounds. These variables impact the ways in which students will progress in their English language acquisition across the domains of speaking, listening, reading and writing. Depending on their background, ELLs may often have strong oral proficiency in their home language with less proficiency in reading and writing. Likewise, the oral English language proficiency of ELLs may be more highly developed than their abilities in comprehending and producing written language. In light of this, give consideration to when ELLs might be struggling with content and when they are struggling with the skill-specific proficiency needed to understand what they read or to express concepts in writing. Use multimodal input on topics simultaneously (e.g., read alouds, English language subtitles on videos) to help students begin to align their proficiency in receptive skills (listening/reading) and in their productive skills (speaking/writing). Provide continued opportunities for students to express their understanding of topics orally.

Look for ways to provide opportunities to draw on and incorporate students’ home languages into their learning. Support ELLs in strategically using their home language in the classroom to enrich their engagement with tasks and to deepen their understanding of content and concepts. Encourage students to engage in discussions in home language groups, to reflect in writing in their home language, and to make connections between linguistic features of the English language and their home language. For content-based tasks, when possible, consider providing translated texts and audiovisual materials to help ELLs gain access to topics in their home language.

Create a supportive and inclusive classroom environment by reminding students that everyone is working toward improvement. Be sure to highlight and praise growth and development rather than relative performance. Use as a topic or text warmer or reflection with the entire class: a check-in at any strategic point during the unit to continually connect students’ personal experience to the topic or text and to share how each one has changed and grown in association with the other. Invite students to share any cultural connections they may have made with the text and topic. Foster inclusive action by creating space for students to express their feelings about the Holocaust, knowing that these discussions may help create equity or unearth trauma, or both. Consult with a guidance counselor, school social worker, or ESL teacher for further investigation of diversity and inclusion.

Varieties of English

Lessons and materials throughout this unit invite students to examine the linguistic choices of key characters from *Maus I* to explore tone, dialogue, and the use of active and passive voice. Throughout the novel, the character Vladek uses a variety of English that may not be familiar to students, as its linguistic features differ from the varieties of English that students might expect to encounter, say, during a classroom discussion or in an academic paper. This guide, a discussion in Lesson 2, as well as lesson materials, including Language Dives, aim to help students develop a clearer sense of how their own language can effectively and appropriately change according to audience, purpose, and context, including in the classroom, while also uplifting and celebrating diversity in language usage.

Conversation Cues

Encourage productive and equitable conversation with Conversation Cues, which are questions that help students achieve four goals:

- (Goal 1) encourage all students to talk and be understood;

- (Goal 2) listen carefully to one another and seek to understand;

- (Goal 3) deepen thinking;

- (Goal 4) think with others to expand the conversation (adapted from Michaels, Sarah, and Cathy O’Connor. *Talk Science Primer*. TERC, 2012. http://inquiryproject.terc.edu/shared/pd/TalkScience_Primer.pdf. Based on Chapin, S., O’Connor, C., and N. Anderson. \[2009\]. *Classroom Discussions: Using Math Talk to Help Students Learn, Grades K–6*. Second Edition. Math Solutions Publications).

Refer to the Tools Page (http://eled.org/tools) for the complete set of cues. Goal 4 Conversation Cues are introduced in Lesson 1 and suggestions for integrating Conversation Cues into instruction are presented across lessons. For ELLs, Conversation Cues are especially critical because they improve language processing abilities and increase engagement and participation. Goal 1 Conversation Cues were introduced in Module 1, Unit 1; Goal 2 Conversation Cues were introduced in Module 1, Unit 3; and Goal 3 Conversation Cues were introduced in Module 2, Unit 2. Goal 4 Conversation Cues are introduced in this module. Conversation Cues across all four goals will continue to be used throughout this module, and suggestions for integrating Conversation Cues into instruction are presented across lessons.

Use Conversation Cues as often as possible to gradually release thinking and expression of ideas to students; avoid using Conversation Cues as a way of searching for the “right” answer. Students often struggle to create productive and equitable conversation during Turn and Talk or Think-Pair-Share protocols; Conversation Cues can make the difference.

Consider this model transcription from a classroom where about 85% of students are ELLs. The teacher is supporting students to build their ideas about the choice the author made when writing this sentence about an athlete’s factors for success: *There were many factors that led to Rickey’s success, but it was support from others in baseball that was most important*. Students can carry the Conversation Cues into small groups to support their own independent productive and equitable conversations.

Mr. Valencia: What if I replace **but** with **and**? **And** is also a conjunction. How would **and** change the meaning? I’ll give you some time to think. Emma, you want to give it a shot?

Emma: It is adding on to the, like, the idea, of the first (part of the) sentence?

Mr. Valencia: Can anyone repeat or rephrase what Emma just said?

Santiago: It would have the same idea as the first two chunks.

Mr. Valencia: Right, **and** would have the same idea as the first two chunks. Two connecting, same ideas. So how does **but** change that for me? Jazmin?

Jazmin: **But** would change it.

Mr. Valencia: Can you say more about that, Jazmin?

Jazmin: It would change it because **but** would say there are many things happening, but this is the one.

Mr. Valencia: So does anyone want to add something else to that?

Daniel: **But** is saying this is the main thing happening.

Mr. Valencia: Right, now the sentence is going to the main factor (for success), or a contrast. **But** is something that is going to tell us a contrast. (Exchange continues.)

Strategic Grouping

Students work in pairs and small groups during text-based discussions, Language Dives, and other tasks. For Language Dives and other tasks that focus on language, match ELLs with a partner who has greater language proficiency. For text-based discussions that focus on theme, tone, and characterization, pair ELLs with students who share the same home language to allow for rich discussion of ideas. The conversations that happen as a result of such strategic pairing will greatly serve the language development of both partners.

In-Class Reading

In this unit, students will read nonfiction texts about the Holocaust to build background knowledge about the topic before then reading the graphic novel *Maus I*. The graphic novel format may be new to many students. Encourage students to use the illustrations throughout the text to aid in comprehension. Students may require additional support in navigating the dialogue throughout the text, particularly because one of the main characters, Vladek, speaks in a dialect that may differ from the varieties of English with which students are familiar. ELLs benefit from a gradual-release approach to in-class reading that increases their level of independence over time. For heavier support, ELLs may find it helpful to follow along during a read-aloud, and for lighter support, students can take turns reading aloud from the text and following along in small groups. Help students to understand that some of the language in *Maus I* may differ from classroom and home varieties of English.

Text-Based Discussions

As in Module 1, break down content, share-outs, or tasks into two parts for ELLs: cognitive and linguistic. First, invite home language use to allow students to more comfortably process their ideas. This will allow students to first focus on the cognitive demands necessary to complete particularly demanding content, share-outs, or tasks. In addition, inviting home language use helps students build academic mindsets. After they have met the cognitive demands in their home language, they can be invited to discuss the task in classroom English, a language they are still learning. Some ELLs may require additional support during the Desktop Teaching Protocol on the End of Unit 1 Assessment.

Differentiated Materials

Differentiated (▲) materials are available for ELLs and other students who would benefit from an increased level of support. These resources have been modified for the purposes of creating accessibility to content and concepts and supporting language development. Depending upon the task being carried out, images, selected response options, answer banks, sentence frames, or model responses have been embedded to guide students’ thinking without compromising a focus on standards and the skills that students are developing and applying to meet them.

Celebration

Celebrate the courage, enthusiasm, diversity, and bilingual assets that ELLs bring to the classroom. Additionally, students can celebrate their successful attempts at communication, focusing on progress, rather than perfection.
