Throughout Units 1 and 2, you read *Maus I: A Survivor’s Tale: My Father Bleeds History*, explored the history of the Holocaust, and studied victims and survivors of this genocide. Throughout Unit 3, you studied upstanders of the Holocaust and how they risked their own safety to protect the lives of the Jewish people as they faced persecution at the hands of Hitler’s Nazi army. You wrote a short narrative that interviewed an imagined Holocaust upstander based on the historical heroes you studied. Now, you will create graphic panels to visually represent a section of your narrative, similar to the graphic novel anchor text. You will present your graphic panels to an audience and answer questions.

**Your presentation will include the following:**

- At least six panels, that portray a moment from your Unit 3 narrative (panel should cover one to two pages of 8.5" × 11" paper)

- At least one example of dialogue

- At least one example of a domain specific vocabulary word and one example of an academic vocabulary word you have acquired in this module

- Visuals that portray the description and dialogue in each panel

- A written reflection on the work you have created, which you will present orally to your audience

- Prompt cards with speaking points about your reflection on the planning process for the graphic panels. You will refer to these prompt cards during your presentation.

- Time to answer questions from your audience members
