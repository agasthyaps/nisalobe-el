**Directions:** As you enter class, read the following quote, and answer the questions below.

“The art of leadership . . . consists in **consolidating** the attention of the people against a single **adversary** and taking care that nothing will split up that attention.” — Adolf Hitler

Source: “Adolf Hitler 1889–1945, German Dictator.” *Oxford Essential Quotations*. Edited by Susan Ratcliffe, 5th edition, Oxford University Press, 2017. Web

An **adversary** is an enemy.

Use context and the affix list to determine the meaning of **consolidating**. Then, consult a dictionary to clarify the precise meaning of the word.

(Hint: Look at the affixes **con-** and **-solid**.)

*Consolidating* means unite. The prefix *con-* means together, *solid* means cannot be broken. The first part of the quote means the art of leadership consists of bringing together the attention of the people in a way that cannot be broken.

Paraphrase the quote in your own words. Use the new vocabulary to explain why this quote may be important.

A good leader can bring a people together, turn them against an enemy, and maintain their focus on that enemy. This quote is important because it says that a talented leader should consolidate a people and make them believe they have a common adversary. The leader should focus their hatred and energy toward that enemy, which can cause violence and prejudice.
