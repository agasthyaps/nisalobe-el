**Sentence**

Brace yourself—the Bielsko factory **has been robbed**! (from page 36, panel 3 of *Maus I* by Art Spiegelman)

Launch

If necessary, students can recall how to form and use present perfect. Consider displaying the present perfect form (**has/have** + past participle) and engaging students in a short discussion of what this verb tense communicates about the timing of an event or action. (Answers will vary, but may include an action that has taken place once or many times before now at an unspecified time; experiences or changes that have taken place over time; an uncompleted action.)

Brace yourself—

Deconstruct

- **Brace yourself**

“What does the idiom brace yourself mean?” (To prepare oneself to hear shocking information. \[independent clause in the imperative mood; idiom\])

“Can you figure out why Vladek would say ‘Brace yourself’ at the beginning of a sentence?” (To grab the listeners’ attention.)

- —

“Can you figure out why the author included a dash after this command in this piece of dialogue?” (To indicate that the speaker is taking a pause before the shocking news is delivered.)

- Students can generate a list of other language they know that is used to grab someone’s attention before saying something important or shocking.  Step 2

the Bielsko factory

Deconstruct

- **the Bielsko factory**

“Who owns the Bielsko factory?” (Vladek. \[noun phrase; subject\])

“Why is the the Bielsko factory important to Vladek and his family?” (They rely on the factory as a source of income.)

- Students can review the information on pages 36–37 of the text and discuss what they notice to better understand the importance of the Bielsko factory.

has been robbed!

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- **has been robbed**

“Can you figure out if the verb in this chunk is written in active or passive voice? Why do you think that?” (passive)

- **has been**

“Why does Vladek use the present perfect form of to be to form the passive voice instead of the simple past tense in this chunk?” (The incident occurred in the past, but it was recent and we don’t know exactly when. News of the robbery is still being shared.  
\[has + been = present perfect form of the verb to be\])

- **robbed**

“What verb is this the past participle form of?” (past participle of the verb to rob)

“How can we write this chunk in active voice using someone as the subject? I’ll give you time to think and write on your note-catchers.” (Someone <u>has robbed the Bielsko factory.)</u>  Step 4

- **Students can use Conversation Cues as they discuss. To provide heavier support, display a suggested sequence, such as the one below:**

- Goal 1. “Can you say more about that?”

- Goal 2: “Who can tell us what they said in your own words?”

- Goal 3: “How does our discussion add to your understanding of how verbs are formed in passive voice?”

- Goal 4: “Who can add on to what they said?”

- Based on their understanding of the historical context of the Holocaust, students can connect the incident to the guiding question: (what was the Holocaust, and how did it occur?) by discussing the implications of the Bielsko factory being robbed, why it might have happened, and what it will mean for Vladek and his family moving forward, as Jewish people living in Europe during the Holocaust.

Practice (Focus Structure)

- The rule \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ by the students.

present perfect form of be + past participle form of a verb

(The rule <u>has been followed</u> by the students.)  Step 5

- To provide lighter support: Ask “Can we make the subject of this sentence plural? What do we have to change in the verb if we do so?”

- To provide heavier support: Invite students to discuss the meaning of the sentence in home language groups, pointing to the parts of English sentences as they do.

Brace yourself—the Bielsko factory has  
been robbed!

Reconstruct

- Ask:

“How does brace yourself impact the meaning and tone of this sentence?” (It makes the tone of this sentence urgent and suggests that this is significant and shocking information.)

“Why do you think the speaker used a verb in passive voice to deliver shocking news?”  
(To draw the listeners attention to the object of the verb, the Bielsko factory, for the purpose of emphasizing the impact of this incident. It’s also possible that the speaker does not know who robbed the factory, and therefore, would not be able to include a subject in this statement.)

- Students can take 30 seconds in pairs to discuss how this incident, and the tone in which information about it is delivered, propels the action forward in the story.

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the learning target: ‘I can analyze how specific word choices impact meaning and tone’?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice (Sentence)

- “Brace yourself— \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_!

object + present perfect form of be + past participle form of a verb = sentence in passive voice

(Brace yourself—<u>school has been cancelled</u>!)  Step 6

- To provide lighter support: “What if we replace *brace yourself* with another word or phrase? How can we use this language in our own speaking and writing?”

- To provide heavier support: Invite students to discuss the meaning of the sentence in home language groups. Add the nouns and passive verbs in students’ home languages to the Parts of Speech anchor chart.
