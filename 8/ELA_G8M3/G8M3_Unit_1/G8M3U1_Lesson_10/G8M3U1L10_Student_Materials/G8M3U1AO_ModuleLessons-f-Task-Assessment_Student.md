**Part II: Summarize *Maus I***

**Directions:** Write a summary of the novel *Maus I*. Use your Whole-Book Literary Summary Writing Plan graphic organizer and the Criteria for an Effective Literary Summary anchor chart for support. (RL8.1, RL.8.2)

Be sure your summary addresses the following criteria:

- Introduces the text stating the title, author, and chapter, section, or pages

- Briefly outlines what the text is about

- Clearly states the central idea(s)

- Includes key events and the most important details from the text to explain the central idea(s) and theme presented

- Includes a statement of theme (the point or message the author wants you to take away)

- Remains objective without opinions or judgments

- Wraps up with a concluding statement

- Is short, clear, and concise

A **central idea** is an important thing the author wants the reader to know and to remember when they have finished the text.
