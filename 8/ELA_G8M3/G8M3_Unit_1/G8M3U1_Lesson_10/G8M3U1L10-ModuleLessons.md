Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Work Time A: Students complete their end of unit assessment by answering questions about passive voice and writing an effective literary summary of *Maus I*. (RL.8.1, RL.8.2, W.8.9a, W.8.10, L.8.1b, L.8.3a)

- Closing and Assessment A: Students share the independent research reading they have been working on for 20 minutes each day for homework. (RI.8.10)

- In this lesson, the habit of character focus is on working to become an ethical person. The characteristic that students practice is integrity as they participate in an independent research reading share.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Ask students to reflect on their growth or learning between the mid-unit assessment and the end of unit assessment. Also, consider asking students to create goals for the coming unit.

- Provide students with prompts for writing or discussion that promote analysis of the text as a whole:

- How would *Maus I* be different if the characters were humans instead of animals?

- Write an imaginary chapter of Anja’s diaries. What do you imagine they say? What do you think her experience was?

- Why do you think the final chapter of the book is entitled “The Mousetrap”?

- Invite students to find examples in other texts or media that support the ideas conveyed through the two prominent themes that students explore in *Maus I:*

- “There is a deep human will to persevere, to keep one’s self and family alive, in the face of oppression.”

- “It is important to remember a painful past in order to educate future generations.”

- Students can share the resources they find with small groups or the class or write a short reflection on how the ideas within these themes connect to other texts or media.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students analyzed passive voice in text and writing, tracked gist, plot, and emerging themes of *Maus I*, as well as analyzed and planned whole-book summaries. In this lesson, students will answer questions about passive voice and write a literary summary of *Maus I* using the gist, plot, and emerging themes tracker for the end of unit assessment.

Support All Students

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment.

- Some students may need the text read aloud before they work on the questions. Invite students who require this to sit in a group away from the rest of the students, so as not to be distracting.

- For some students, this assessment may require more than the 20 minutes allotted. Consider providing time over multiple days if necessary.

- The homework assignment introduces a poem, “The Blind Men and the Elephant,” which is referenced in the model essay students will analyze in Unit 2, Lesson 1. Please note that this poem has been revised from the original poem, written by John Godfrey Saxe in 1872, for cultural sensitivity. Note that this poem was selected because a theme of the poem is comparable to a theme in *Summer of the Mariposas* and it is thus relevant to a literary analysis essay comparing structure and meaning.

- To support ELLs, this lesson has an assessment with questions that are closely aligned to the tasks students have been carrying out throughout the unit. Students will answer selected and constructed response questions on the use of active and passive voice (L.8.1b, L.8.3b) and write a whole-text summary of *Maus I*.

- ELLs may find it challenging to write a whole-text summary, as most of their experience with summary writing has been with shorter texts and sections and chapters of books. Reassure students that the analysis and planning they carried out in Lessons 8 and 9 has prepared them to take on this task. Encourage them to stay focused on the overall story rather than details, and provide support in understanding the assessment directions to ensure that students have a clear understanding of what is being asked of them. Celebrate students’ progress throughout the unit, and congratulate them on their learning.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.C.11 and 8.I.C.12.

Assessment Guidance

- Assessment materials (student copy, answer key, student exemplar, teacher checklist, and rubric) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will analyze a model essay in order to prepare to write their own.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- As students enter the classroom, invite them to complete **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 10** using their **Mid-Unit 1 Assessments with feedback** on their desks.

- Circulate as students review their feedback, and offer guidance and support as necessary.

- Once all students are ready, invite them to share their stars and steps with a partner. Remind students that everyone is working toward individual goals and that learning is about continued growth and development.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. End of Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Passive Voice and Active Voice and Summarize *Maus I* (20 minutes)

- Review the learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can use the passive voice in my writing.”

“I can write an effective literary summary of a novel.”

- Invite students to retrieve their **Whole-Book Literary Summary Writing Plan graphic organizer**. Tell students that they will use their plans to write their summary paragraphs at the end of the assessment.

- Distribute **End of Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Passive Voice and Active Voice and Summarize *Maus I***.

- Read aloud the directions for the assessment as students read along silently. Read, reread, and rephrase. Answer clarifying questions.

- Remind students that this is an assessment. Ensure all students understand the assessment directions. Answer their questions, refraining from supplying answers to the assessment questions themselves.

- Invite students to begin working on the assessment.

For Lighter Support

- Before the assessment of Work Time A, underline key vocabulary in the assessment directions and prompt and read aloud together as a class to ensure that students understand each task included in the assessment. Invite students who need lighter support to restate or clarify information for students who need heavier support.

- Before the assessment, give students 2 minutes to orally rehearse their summaries. This will help students to review their planning and provide an opportunity to refine the content they will include in their writing. For many students, oral processing is an effective way to think through writing tasks before putting pen to paper.

For Heavier Support

- Display a “map” of the assessment to reference while explaining directions to the end of unit assessment. This will reduce ambiguity and give students a clearer picture of what they can expect so that they can better allocate their time and attentional resources. Provide students with colored pencils or highlighters so that they can mark up the map as needed. Example:

- Part I: Answer selected and constructed response questions about active and passive voice.

- Part II: Write a whole-book summary of *Maus I* that includes information about theme.

Work Time

B. Discuss Development of Theme in *Maus I* – RL.8.2 (10 minutes)

- Congratulate students on completing the End of Unit 1 Assessment, and explain that the rest of the class time will be used to synthesize ideas about theme in *Maus I*. Remind students that the themes of a text are the messages or main ideas relevant to the real world that the author wants the reader to take away from reading a literary text. Remind students that a text may have many themes, and multiple themes often emerge that are not fully developed until the end of the story. Explain that students should look for the most prominent, recurring themes and track their development throughout the story.

- Display the **Gist, Plot, Character, and Emerging Theme anchor chart**. Ask volunteers to read the emerging themes that have been tracked.

- Ask students to Turn and Talk:

“What are the one or two most important or prominent themes you saw developed in *Maus I*? What makes you think that?” (Answers will vary but should be about perseverance, the human will to survive, and remembering.)

- Cold-call students to share their ideas. Display the following two themes and read them aloud. Explain that these are two of the most prominent themes developed throughout *Maus I*, and that students will continue to work with these themes in the next unit:

- “There is a deep human will to persevere, to keep one’s self and family alive, in the face of oppression.”

- “It is important to remember a painful past in order to educate future generations.”

- Turn and Talk:

“How can we paraphrase these two themes? How would you state these themes in your own words?” (Answers will vary, but may include the following: Humans are determined to never give up, especially when their family or themselves are in danger. It is important to teach the youth about history.)

- Think-Pair-Share:

“How are these themes relevant to the real world? Why do you think the author wants the reader to understand these real world messages?” (They explain how humans experience life; the author thinks people should persevere to protect themselves and family, as well as teach youth about their history to learn from the mistakes of the past.)

“How are these themes developed throughout *Maus I*?” (Art visits Vladek to hear his Holocaust story for his graphic novel, and throughout the course of the book, Vladek is educating his son about his painful past; throughout the book, Vladek finds ways to pay for his freedom and protect his family, hides in safe houses, and even sends his son away to protect him.)

- Focus students on the Gist, Plot, Character, and Emerging Theme anchor chart. Ask a volunteer:

“What is an example of a key plot element from *Maus I* that supports the theme ‘There is a deep human will to persevere, to keep one’s self and family alive, in the face of oppression’?” (Answers will vary but may include the following: Vladek pays a Polish woman to hide in her barn, then another Polish woman to hide in her cellar; Vladek uses jewelry he saved to pay influential people to hide him and Anja from the Gestapo and get him jobs to keep him alive.)

“What is an example of a key plot element from *Maus I* that supports the theme ‘It is important to remember a painful past in order to educate future generations’?” (Answers will vary but may include the following: Art wants his father to tell his story of the Holocaust; Vladek shows Art the valuables he hid during the Holocaust and managed to retrieve when the war was over. He tells Art he wants him to have his valuables after he dies.)

“How do habits of character connect to this theme?” (Answers will vary, but could mention that it is important to practice empathy and learn about the experiences of others, even devastating experiences, in order for future generations to learn from the past.)

- Explain to students that they will continue to discuss and write about these themes and other aspects of *Maus I* that contribute to the author’s intended meaning in upcoming lessons.

Closing and Assessment

A. Share Independent Research Reading – RI.8.10 (10 minutes)

- Remind students that the purpose of research reading is to build their content knowledge on the topic so many of the ideas and domain-specific vocabulary words become familiar. This makes complex texts easier to read and understand. Remind students that they are expected to read independently for 20 minutes each day for homework, logging their reading and choosing and responding to a prompt in their independent reading journals.

- Explain that when a person is honest and follows through tasks like homework, this demonstrates *integrity*.

- Read aloud the habit of character recorded on the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**:

“I behave with integrity. This means I am honest and do the right thing, even when it’s difficult, because it is the right thing to do.”

- Invite students to turn and talk to an elbow partner:

“Using the anchor chart as a guide, what does integrity mean in your own words?” (Being honest and doing the right thing.)

- Tell students they will now use the Think-Pair-Share protocol to discuss their ideas with a partner:

“What does integrity look like? What might you see when someone is showing empathy to someone else?” See Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart (example for teacher reference).

“What does integrity sound like? What might you hear when someone is showing empathy to someone else?” See Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart (example for teacher reference).

- Provide examples of showing integrity. (Example: Doing the right thing even if the teacher is not looking at you, or not looking at someone else’s assessment and copying his or her answers.)

- Add this word to the **academic word wall** with translations in home languages.

- Refer to the **Independent Reading Sample Plans** located on the Tools Page (http://eled.org/tools) to guide students through a research reading share or use another routine.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- Use a Conversation Cue to prompt students to paraphrase what their partner said during the independent research reading share (e.g., “Who can repeat what your classmate said?” “Who can tell us what your classmate said in your own words?”). This will help students to practice restating ideas in their own words, and hearing others relay what they have shared will promote thoughtful consideration of the goals students have set around collaboration.

For Heavier Support

- Invite students to draw graphic panels that represents an event or incident in their independent research reading text. This will help students to deepen their understanding of the text they have read and serve as continued practice with graphic panel creation, which connects to the performance task in the module.

Homework

A. Determine Gist

- Students complete **Homework: Read a Poem and Determine Gist**.
