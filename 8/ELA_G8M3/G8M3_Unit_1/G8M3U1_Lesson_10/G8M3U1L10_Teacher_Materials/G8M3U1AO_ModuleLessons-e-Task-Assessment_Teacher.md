End of Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Passive Voice and Active Voice and Summarize *Maus I*

(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** This assessment has two parts. In Part I, you will answer questions about dialogue, word choice, tone, and theme in Chapter 6 of *Maus I*. In Part II, you will write a summary of the novel.

**Part I: Selected Response and Short Constructed Response**

1.  On page 139, panel 10, in the sentence, “But remember—if **you’re found** there, I don’t know you!” Mrs. Kawka uses the passive voice. What effect does this have on the meaning of the information in the statement? (L.8.1b, L.8.3a)

By using the passive voice to make this statement, Mrs. Kawka is emphasizing the outcome that might occur, rather than focusing on who would find Vladek.

1.  Change the following sentence on page 156, panel 8, from active to passive voice to shift the emphasis to the object of the verb **takes away**. (L.8.1b, L.8.3a)

“Every week or so a truck takes some of the prisoners away.”

Every week or so some of the prisoners are taken away.

**Part II: Summarize *Maus I***

**Directions:** Write a summary of the novel *Maus I*. Use your Whole-Book Literary Summary Writing Plan graphic organizer and the Criteria for an Effective Literary Summary anchor chart for support. Be sure your summary addresses the following criteria:

- Introduces the text stating the title, author, and chapter, section, or pages

- Briefly outlines what the text is about

- Clearly states the central idea(s)

- Includes key events and the most important details from the text to explain the central idea(s) and theme presented

- Includes a statement of theme (the point or message the author wants you to take away)

A **central idea** is an important thing the author wants the reader to know and to remember when they have finished the text.

Answers will vary. In the graphic novel *Maus I* by Art Spiegelman, the author visits his father, Vladek, to learn about his experiences. Vladek was once a young Jewish man living in Poland during the Holocaust. As Art interviews Vladek, we learn about how Vladek survived the Holocaust. When the war began, Vladek became a Polish soldier. He was captured by the Germans and became a prisoner of war. For months, he lived in a German prisoner of war camp. When he returned to Poland, he found that terrible things were happening to Jews in his city, Sosnowiec. Jews were forced into ghettos and were treated violently and killed. A deep sense of agency enabled Vladek to persevere. He managed to survive, but it took a terrible toll on him and his family. As a result of his wartime experiences, his life has been difficult ever since. Yet Vladek continues to try to live as best he can. Ultimately, *Maus I* explores the theme that there is a deep human will to persevere, to keep oneself and one’s family alive, in the face of oppression.
