(For Teacher Reference)

**When Reading a Text in Graphic Novel Format, Close Readers Do These Things:**

- Read the text left to right, top to bottom.

- Refer to each single image as a **panel**.

- Pay attention to captions, speech bubbles, and tails.

- Read both the words and the images to get the author’s full intent.

- Pay attention to subtle details in the images: expressions, shading, perspective, what was included in each panel, etc.

- Pay attention to how the dialogue is presented: facial expressions, body language, additional images, etc.

- Pay attention to graphic styles presented: words in CAPS, **bold**, or accentuated in some way.
