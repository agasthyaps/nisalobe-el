Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RL.8.1 – Work Time B: Students preview the new anchor text, *Maus I*, discussing evidence from pages 4–5 that supports their understanding of the characters.

- RL.8.3 – Closing and Assessment A: On their exit ticket, students answer text-dependent questions analyzing how particular lines of dialogue and incidents reveal aspects of a character or provoke a decision in *Maus I*, chapter 1.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become ethical people by showing respect as they learn about and reflect on the events of the Holocaust and on working to become effective learners by collaborating as they work in pairs throughout the lesson.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Provide students the opportunity to explore the events, people, and history of the Holocaust in more depth. Allow students to further build their background knowledge by researching one or more of the topics explored in Lessons 1 and 2. Students might share their findings in small groups or with the whole class.

- Invite students to explore additional graphic novels. Consider providing a variety of graphic novels for students to review, developing a deeper understanding of the graphic novel format, how to read it, and heightening their interest in this format of literature.

- In Work Time, challenge students to create a series of graphic panels that represent event in a familiar text, *Summer of the Mariposas*, which students read in Module 1. Students may also wish to carry out this extension using a text that they have read for Independent Research Reading. After students have created their graphic panels, they can share with small groups or with the whole class. This will help students to further understand how a story can be conveyed through a visual, graphic format.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Students began Unit 1 of Module 3 by examining many images, texts, maps, timelines, and sources of information that allowed them to infer the topic of Module 3. Lesson 2 builds on the infer the topic lesson by providing students more time to read about important events and people involved in the Holocaust. Students are introduced to their new anchor text, *Maus I*, and begin looking at structure and characters in this graphic novel. In the next lesson, students continue to deepen their understanding as they do a close read of a nonfiction text about the Holocaust.

Support All Students

- Note there is a differentiated version of the Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 2 used in Opening A in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Presenting learning targets in writing, orally, and if possible, accompanied by symbols will help students to understand the language within them. ▲

- Students are introduced to the module anchor text, *Maus I*, in Work Time B, which discusses the main character’s experience during the Holocaust. Specifically, in chapter 1 of *Maus I*, potentially sensitive topics such as suicide, heart attacks, and an allusion to intercourse are brought up. Also note that the building background resource in the Homework brings up potentially sensitive topics such as genocide, concentration camps, and bigotry. Be aware that the topic of the Holocaust presented in the book may be sensitive for students and that some students may connect with these issues personally and deeply. Students’ reactions to materials presented in this lesson and throughout the unit will vary depending on their own knowledge of the Holocaust, their family and ethnic histories, and their emotional composition. Some students and their families may find these topics to be upsetting or in conflict with their values. Allow for time to process and respond to these topics during individual, small group, or full class discussion, and reach out to families as needed.

- Some students may be more familiar than others with the graphic novel format. While the graphic novel format supports different types of learning, and many students may enjoy this format, others may find it less preferable than traditional texts. Find ways to support all students’ engagement in the text.

- Students may need additional support understanding how to read a graphic novel for the first time. Provide students additional context to understand how to read a graphic novel. This will set an important framework and help students deeply analyze the text in future lessons—pulling out nuances in language, characterization, tone, theme and meaning.

- Be aware that students who use Polish or other Slavic languages like Russian, Macedonian, or Ukrainian as home languages may find Vladek’s dialect of English familiar, as it is informed by language structure in Polish, which is a Slavic language. Celebrate linguistic diversity by highlighting that being able to use language in different ways is an asset and not a deficiency.

- Pair students (especially ELLs) thoughtfully for pair share to build supportive and safe exchange. Vary these partners throughout the unit to expose students to diverse perspectives one-on-one. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson includes an orientation to the graphic novel format and time to explore the anchor text for this module: *Maus I*. Students will also have an opportunity to build background knowledge about the Holocaust and familiarize themselves with a glossary of important events, people, and places that can be used throughout the unit and the module as a reference. This lesson also includes a discussion about varieties of English and the way in which language varies by context. ELLs may find this discussion reassuring, as it provides an opportunity to celebrate linguistic and cultural diversity and to affirm differences in dialect.

- ELLs may find it challenging to follow the graphic novel format of *Maus I*, as this may be unfamiliar type of text to many students. Encourage students to notice how the text and the illustrations are connected, and highlight that the graphic novel format has the potential to provide multiple forms of input, which may ultimately be helpful to students in comprehending the events within the text. ELLs may require additional support in navigating the online Holocaust resources; pair students thoughtfully with supportive peers during this activity.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 8.I.A.1, 8.I.B.5, 8.I.B.6, and 8.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ gist notes to ensure students understand important aspects of character and details of setting from chapter 1 in *Maus I*.

- Review student answers on the exit ticket to identify any students who are having trouble comprehending the anchor text, *Maus I*.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a guided reading of a nonfiction text on the Holocaust in order to continue to build background knowledge. Students also work through a Language Dive in order to more deeply understand the central ideas in the text. In future lessons, students continue to read *Maus I*, looking closely at dialogue and tone in the text.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RL.8.1 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: As students arrive, invite them to complete **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 2**.

- Once they finish, direct students join a predetermined partner and to review their Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 2. For ELLs and students who require additional support, the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 2** ▲ can be used to help guide students’ thinking by providing hints about which affixes to consider.

- Tell students they will now draw upon the answers they wrote down in Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 2 and spend 2 minutes discussing what they notice and wonder about the book, including the cover, synopsis, and chapter titles. Prompt partner B to share a notice or a wonder first, then partner A, and then partner B again, and so on.

- Use **equity sticks** to select students to share out what they discussed. As students share out, draw an I Notice/I Wonder T-chart on the board and complete it as students share. Listen for suggestions such as “I notice the book title is ***Maus I: A Survivor’s Tale***. The fact that it is *Maus I* implies that it is the first book in a series.” Use the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 2 (answers for teacher reference)** as a guide.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- As an alternative to Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 2 ▲, to support ELLs’ independent notices and wonderings in the text, provide students with scaffolded instructions for locating important information within the text. These instructions could include the following:

- “Scan the text for the names of characters and cities. Which do you see repeated? Why do you think these might be important?”

- “Read the chapter titles on the contents page. Do the titles seem serious? Silly? Strange?”

- “Look at the illustrations within the text. Who do you see? Are there any patterns you notice? What does this make you think this text will be about?”

For Heavier Support

- Invite students who need heavier support to use the Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 2 ▲. This resource has sentence starters to help guide students in their observations.

Work Time

A. Introduction: How to Read a Graphic Novel (10 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can read a text in graphic novel format.”

- Invite students to spend a couple of minutes looking over *Maus I: A Survivor’s Tale* either independently or with an elbow partner.

- Prompt students to Think-Pair-Share:

“Have you ever read any other graphic novels? If so, what were they, and how are they different from other book formats?” (Responses will vary.)

“What are some reasons authors might choose to use a graphic novel format?” (Responses will vary, but may recognize that telling a story in pictures and words is compelling for the reader; the visual aspect of a graphic novel helps draw readers in; the pictures become a critical aspect of the story and enhances how emotions or events are conveyed, etc.)

“Why do you think the author of *Maus I* decided to write his story as a graphic novel?” (Responses will vary, but may reference the importance of pairing illustrations with text to tell a powerful story. The graphic format helps make the serious and important subject matter accessible to more readers.)

- Direct students to the **Graphic Novel Format anchor chart,** and working together, begin to record important aspects from the discussion on the chart.

- Tell students that a graphic novel uses text and illustrations in a graphic format to tell a story. Remind them that most of the books they read in previous modules relied solely on text to construct a narrative. In this new anchor text, *Maus I*, the author uses graphic elements (panels, frames, speech/thought bubbles, color, contrast, shading, perspective, etc.) in a sequential way to tell the reader a story. The interplay of the text and illustrations can be a powerful way of evoking a story in a reader’s mind. Other books they have read, such as the novel *Summer of the Mariposas*, also portray speech, thought, contrast, and perspective—but through description and text dialogue, rather than through the interplay of text and illustration.

- Explain to students that there is a lot to pay attention to when reading a graphic novel, and it is important to have a clear understanding of how to read a graphic novel. This will help the class locate sections of text accurately and discuss portions of the text easily together as a group.

- Have students turn to page 5 and look at the first image at the top of the page.

- Tell students:

“Each page is made up of several *panels*. Each panel is a single drawing on the page. It is usually defined in a box by a border.”

- Ask students:

“How many panels do you see on page 5?” (There are five panels, and although the first is larger in size, it is still only one panel.)

- Tell students:

“To read the graphic novel, it is important to know which way to progress sequentially across the page.”

“Just like reading a book, you start on the upper left hand side of the page. You will read the sequence of panels that go across in the first row to the right, and then proceed down to the next row, which you read across to the right, and then proceed down to the next row.”

- Ask students to count how many rows they see on page 5. (There are three rows.)

- Make sure students are clear on the left-to-right, top-to-bottom process of reading a graphic novel page before moving on.

- Tell students:

“When discussing the book, we might refer to the panels by number in order to locate images and text easily. For example, on page 6 there is a close-up image of Art’s father wearing glasses.”

- Direct students to put their finger on this image.

- Ask:

“What panel number would this be?” (This would be panel 3. The reader counts across the first row, encountering two panels, then going down to the second row, encountering this panel, which is the third panel.)

- Tell students:

“When it comes to dialogue in a graphic novel, there are many things readers need to note. For example, a *caption* is a tool in a graphic novel that gives the narrator a voice.”

“A *speech bubble* shows the dialogue. The character speaking is usually indicated by the *tail* of the speech balloon.”

- Direct students to work with a partner to identify the captions, speech bubbles, and tails on pages 5 and 6.

- Pause to field any clarifying questions on the terminology and process for reading a graphic novel.

- Explain that in addition to the conventions of how to read a graphic novel, there are additional aspects of the text they will have to pay attention to in *Maus I* that are different from a traditional novel.

- Prompt students to brainstorm, answering the question:

“What additional things will readers need to pay attention to when reading a graphic novel?”

- Circulate as students discuss, listening for important features and aspect of graphic novels. Refer to the **Graphic Novel Format anchor chart (for teacher reference)**, as needed.

- Discuss with students the importance of the following features:

- In graphic novels, readers have to pay attention to the visual representations as well as the written text.

- In graphic novels, the dialogue is seen as well as read (as in a traditional novel), so the reader will have to pay attention to visuals like facial descriptions, background images, etc. to get the full meaning.

- In graphic novels, the writer can use imagery to suggest more meaning, give hints, or provide more details than just words alone can do (like the use of mice and rats in *Maus I*).

- Direct students to the Graphic Novel Format anchor chart once again, and working together, record additional aspects from the discussion on the chart.

- Direct students to the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**, and ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“How will you work toward this habit while reading this graphic novel?” (Responses will vary, but may mention that they will practice perseverance as they read a new type of text and work through challenges that arise from reading a text that is different from others they have read in the past.)

- With students’ support, record the meaning of *graphic novel* (a story that is presented in sequential illustrations), *panel* (a single drawing on the page of a graphic novel), *caption* (brief text over or under a picture that describes the picture or explains what the people in it are doing or saying), *speech* *bubble* (a circle containing the words someone says in a graphic novel), and *tail* (the pointed part of the speech bubble that indicates the person speaking) on the **domain-specific word wall**, with translations in students’ home languages. Write synonyms or sketch a visual above the word to scaffold students’ understanding. Invite students to record these words in their **vocabulary logs**.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

B. Preview *Maus I* – RL.8.1 (10 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can read a text in graphic novel format.”

- Direct students to retrieve their copy of the text *Maus I* and read the entire title; *Maus I: A Survivor’s Tale: My Father Bleeds History*. Ask students to Turn and Talk:

“What does this title suggest the book will be about?” (Responses will vary, but should include that the book will tell a tale about the author’s father, who lived through an important historical time period, and it suggests that he was a survivor.)

“Why did the author choose the words *bleeds history* instead of choosing the word *scar* or *wound*?” (The word *bleeds* implies being deeply wounded and suggests how fresh or permanent his wound still is. The author did not use the word *scar*, which would have suggested the wound has healed.)

- Tell students that they should continue to reflect on the subtitle *My Father Bleeds History* as they read the text.

- Direct students to turn to page 5. Read aloud pages 5–6 as students follow along silently, both reading the words and viewing the images, in their text.

- Tell students that this section takes place in New York around 1958, recalling a memory the author has of his childhood.

- Direct students to Turn and Talk:

“What character and setting information is the reader given in this excerpt?” (We are introduced to the writer \[Artie, or Art\] and his father, during a memory from the writer’s boyhood, in New York in 1958.)

- Prompt students to point to panels 3–5. Read the panels aloud as students follow along, viewing the images and reading the text.

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“Why does Art’s father talk about being locked in a room with no food for a week?” (Responses will vary, but may include that Vladek had hardships in his life that were similar to what he describes—being locked in a room and without food.)

- Tell students that this scene is also an example of foreshadowing, or providing a hint of what is to come in the text. Vladek’s words suggest that he experienced hardships in his past, which students may read about in upcoming chapters.

“What do you notice about the way he talks to Art?” (He is making it seem like Art’s experience is not important because he had much harder experiences as a young adult.)

“What was the gist of this section?” (Gist: A memory of the writer getting hurt while playing, dad doesn’t comfort him.)

“What is the significance of this scene? Why did the author choose this scene to be the first the reader interacts with in the text?” (Although it is hard to be sure why the author put this scene in the forefront of the book, it introduces the reader to the two main characters and gives the reader insight into the relationship between them. The gulf between father and son will become a significant aspect of the book. It hints at the struggles the father experienced because he references being trapped in a room, without food, for one week. It also gives the reader some initial visual information—the characters look like mice, the story is told in black and white images, with a handful of panels on each page, etc.)

- If productive, use a Goal 4 Conversation Cue to encourage students to agree or disagree and explain why:

“Do you agree or disagree with what your classmate said? Why? I’ll give you time to think.”

- Then, lead students through a discussion regarding the use of varieties of English in this text.

- Start by asking students:

“What do you notice about Vladek’s language? Does the variety of English he uses seem similar to varieties of English that you use?” (Answers will vary but may include that Vladek uses some words in a different order than the order used in the classroom variety of English students are used to and that he sometimes uses different verb tenses than someone might use in the classroom to express things.)

“Why do you think Vladek’s dialect is different from the classroom variety of English we use?” (Answers will vary but may include Vladek lived in Poland, where he spoke Polish as his home language. He learned English there before moving to the United States. His pronunciation, word choice, and use of language structures in English are informed by his home language, Polish. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Tell students that people use different varieties of English in different contexts:

“The way I speak and write in the classroom, is different than the way I speak and write with my family at home. How do you notice people using language differently in different contexts?” (Answers will vary but may include the following: We use English at school, but I speak a different language at home and with my friends. People use text messaging with shortened words, but when we write at school, we are more careful with grammar. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Be clear with students that language can be used in many different ways and that there is no one “right” way to speak or write. Language is used to achieve something, whether that’s sharing ideas, persuading someone, or asking a question. Sometimes language is used in a certain way to accomplish these things, which is why the academic classroom variety of English is taught in school, but this is just one of many ways that people use English.

- Tell students they will see and read instances throughout *Maus I* when Vladek’s language may seem different from the varieties of English that they are familiar with or the variety of English that they are expected to use in school. Help students to understand that paying attention to these differences and nuances in languages can help readers discover aspects of characters or setting and can support a more complete understanding of the text.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time B, to extend the opportunity to think about varieties of English and the different ways in which language is used in different contexts, invite students to compare how they would use language in different scenarios. Displaying the following to guide discussion:

- How would you use language differently in each of the following scenarios? Provide examples of sentences you might say or write in each situation:

- Telling your teacher you didn’t complete your homework compared to writing your best friend a text saying you didn’t complete your homework

- Explaining what an ethical consideration is to an audience during a presentation compared to explaining what an ethical consideration is to a five-year-old

For Heavier Support

N/A

Work Time

C. Read *Maus I*, Chapter 1 (15 minutes)

- Direct students to turn to page 9, the beginning of chapter 1 in *Maus I*.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same process as with previous lessons for students to read chapter 1 of *Maus I*, using the **Text Guide: *Maus I*** **(for teacher reference).** Instruct students to read the chapter independently and support struggling students as needed. If students do not finish reading the chapter within the allotted reading time, distribute **Synopsis: *Maus I***, **Chapter 1** to each student to review the key details from the chapter. Then have students identify the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary, reflect on their reading as they choose, and record the gist on **sticky notes** using the following resources as appropriate: vocabulary logs and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Gist: Vladek tells his son, Art, how he chose to marry Art’s mother.

- Direct students’ attention to the Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart, and review *respect* and *empathy* as needed.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Closing and Assessment

A. Exit Ticket: Text-Dependent Questions***,** Maus I*, Chapter 1 – RL.8.3 (5 minutes)

- Distribute **Exit Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 2**, and ask students to complete the selected response questions independently. Use **Exit Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 2 (answers for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Preread “The Holocaust: An Introductory History”

- Students preread **Homework: “The Holocaust: An Introductory History”** in preparation for studying this text in the next lesson.
