**Directions:** After the close read, answer the following questions.

1.  How would you describe the tone the author’s words create on page 23, panels 5 and 6, when Vladek says: “But this isn’t so proper, so respectful . . . I can tell you other stories but such private things, I don’t want you should mention.” What does this reveal about Vladek’s character? What evidence makes you think so? (RL.8.1, RL.8.3, RL.8.4)

In your response, be sure to include

- a description of the tone that Vladek’s statement creates,

- evidence from the text that supports your description of Vladek’s tone, and

- an explanation of what the statement reveals about Vladek’s character.
