5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

RL.8.4, L.8.1b, L.8.3a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

My mother’s suicide and his two heart attacks **had taken their toll**. (from page 11 of *Maus I* by Art Spiegelman)

**Lesson 4 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after the Close Read in Work Time A.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target **(I can analyze how specific word choices impact meaning and tone)** and RL.8.4 by presenting an opportunity for students to determine the figurative meaning of an idiom. This sentence also helps students to address L.8.1b and L.8.3a by providing an opportunity for students to analyze the form of a verb in the active voice used to achieve the effect of emphasizing the agent carrying out the action in the sentence.

- Supporting Standards: RL.8.3, L.8.4.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses a verb in active voice with the purpose of drawing attention to the agency of the subject (**My mother’s suicide and his two heart attacks**).

- Transfer: subject + verb used in Part I selected response questions and summary writing on the End of Unit 1 Assessment and in future writing tasks.

**Key**

Underline

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **My mother’s suicide and his two heart attacks <u>had taken their toll</u>**.

- Ask:

“What is this sentence about/What is the gist of this sentence/What is the central idea of this sentence?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **had taken their toll**.

- Underline had taken in red, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 

- Ask:

“Is this verb written in active or passive voice? How do you know?” (This is a past perfect verb written in active voice. We know this because it does not follow the passive voice construction of be + verb + -en/-ed.)

“What is the direct object of the verb had taken?” (Their toll.)

- Ask:

“An idiom is a phrase or expression that has a different figurative meaning than the literal meanings of the words within it. Take a toll or take their toll is an idiom.”

“Have you ever heard the idiom take a toll or take their toll before? What does it mean?”  
(To cause negative impact over time through repeated and ongoing struggles or challenges.)

“What other idioms do you know?” (Responses will vary. As necessary, offer examples that students might be familiar with: piece of cake, kill two birds with one stone, cost an arm and a leg, on the ball, cut corners, the best of both worlds.)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **My mother’s suicide and his two heart attacks <u>had taken their toll</u>**.

- Ask:

“How would Vladek’s wife’s suicide and having two heart attacks take a toll on Vladek?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all replies. Consider suggesting that these were likely physically and emotionally difficult experience for Vladek, and he might be tired and discouraged.)

“Can you figure out why the writer used active voice in this sentence?” (To emphasize the specific things that took a toll on Vladek.)

- Display the sentence in passive voice:

> **Their toll had been taken by my mother’s suicide and his two heart attacks.**

- Ask:

“What happens when we write this sentence in passive voice?” (It no longer makes sense because the direct object their toll is part of the idiom had taken their toll. When we write a sentence in passive voice, the sentence starts with an object of the verb. The figurative meaning of idioms comes from a group of words used together, so when don’t split them up because the meaning changes.)

- Ask:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target:  
‘I can analyze how specific word choices impact meaning and tone’?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

> **My mother’s suicide and his two heart attacks had caused suffering.**
>
> .

object + verb + **by** + subject = sentence in passive voice

- Ask:

“Use this sentence frame to change the sentence provided from active to passive voice.”

- As time allows, follow up with a discussion of the difference in effects achieved in each sentence. (In active voice, the focus is on the subject \[the cause of the suffering\]. When the sentence is rewritten in passive voice, the emphasis changes to the object \[suffering\].)

- Possible student answers:

> **<u>Writing a summary is a piece of cake.</u>**
>
> (subject + verb + idiom = idiomatic statement in active voice)
