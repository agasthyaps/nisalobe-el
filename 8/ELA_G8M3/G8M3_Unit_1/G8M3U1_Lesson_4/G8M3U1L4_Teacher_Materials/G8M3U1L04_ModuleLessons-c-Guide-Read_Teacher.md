Close Reading Guide: *Maus I*, Pages 11–23

RL.8.1, RL.8.3, RL.8.4

(For Teacher Reference)

**Purpose and Notes**

- The purpose of this close read is for students to analyze *Maus I*, Chapter 1, to determine what is revealed about the main character, Vladek. To do so, they will focus on key lines of dialogue in the text and incidents that provoke decisions. In addition, they will determine the meaning of key words and phrases in the text, including connotative meanings, and explore the impact of specific words and phrases on meaning and tone.

- Students have preread the entirety of chapter 1 in Lesson 2.

- Students work in pairs for this close read.

- A note-catcher along with text-dependent questions provide an opportunity for students to process and respond to standards-aligned questions.

- At the end of the close read, students will complete a culminating task.

- Continue to use discussion protocols (e.g., Turn and Talk, cold call, and total participation techniques) to engage all students in collaborative discussion about the text.

<li><p>First, remind students that they read chapter 1 in Lesson 2, and ask them what they know about Vladek’s experience up to this point in the text. Using a total participation technique, ask: “What did we learn about Vladek on the first page of the text, page 11?” (Vladek has aged, he has had two heart attacks, his wife committed suicide, he has remarried, and his new wife is also a Holocaust survivor.)</p></li>
<li><p>Distribute the Close Reading note-catcher. Explain that now you will look closely at sections of the text in order to analyze what is revealed about the main character, Vladek. We will be looking at his words, the tone of those words, and his actions.</p></li>
<li><p>Remind students that they can refer to their Holocaust Glossary if they encounter domain-specific vocabulary they do not understand.</p></li>
<li><p>Direct students to read the panels as you read them aloud. Explain that you will think aloud about how the author develops a main character as you read.</p></li>
<li><p>Say: “On page 12, panel 2, Vladek says, ‘It’s good for my heart, the pedaling.’ I’m asking myself, what does this tell us about his character? Well, I know that Vladek has been through a lot, he has had two heart attacks, and his wife has committed suicide. But he is still choosing to bike and stay active. This tells me he cares about staying healthy and alive, even after his two heart attacks and his wife’s suicide, when he could just give up.”</p></li>
<li><p>Explain that this idea that a person can make a choice to help himself is called <strong>agency</strong>. It comes from a Latin word that means <em>to do</em>. Here, Vladek is showing agency about his life because he is making an active choice to do something to help himself.</p></li>

<td>Read page 12, from “The one I used to talk about . . .” to page 12, “not far from the border of Germany . . .”</td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Ask: “On page 12, panel 5, the author shows a close-up of numbers on Vladek’s arm. Why?” (Answers will vary.)</p></li>
<li><p>Explain that during the Holocaust, Jews who were placed in concentration camps had a number tattooed on their arm. Nazis used these numbers, instead of names, to identify people.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “Why do you think the author shows us this picture?” (It reminds us that Vladek survived the terrors of a concentration camp and also that he can never forget that experience because it is tattooed into his skin).</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “Why does the author show us Vladek’s arm as he pedals his exercise bike in this frame? Why are both important to help us learn something about Vladek?” (We remember that Vladek went through a horrible experience years ago but that he is still a very determined person.)</p></li>

<td><ul>
<li><p>Ask: “On page 13, panel 5, we see a poster behind Vladek. What do you notice about the poster?” (Answers will vary.) Explain that this is an <strong>allusion</strong>—an allusion is when the author makes a reference that calls to mind another story. In this case, the author is making an allusion to the 1921 movie, <em>The Sheik</em>, which stars the actor Rudolph Valentino, who was thought to be very handsome. In the movie, the Sheik is a handsome, powerful Arab chief who ends up winning the love of a beautiful American woman. This is also the title of this chapter.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask “Vladek says, ‘People always told me I looked just like Rudolph Valentino.’ What is his tone when he says this?” (Confident, maybe proud.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask students to Turn and Talk: “Why do you think the writer shows us Vladek on his exercise bike in front of this poster, saying that he was like this movie star? What does this reveal about Vladek’s character?” (It reminds us that Vladek was once young, handsome, maybe even powerful. Now he’s not, but he shows agency and keeps trying to help himself be healthy.)</p></li>
<li><p>Prompt students to write down their answers on their Close Reading note-catcher.</p></li>
<li><p>If time, ask, “Why do you think the author chose ‘The Sheik’ as the title of this chapter?’ (He wants to emphasize that at this time in his life, Vladek was young, handsome, in love, with control over his life.)</p></li>

<li><p>Say: “Vladek says, ‘I like to keep things in order.’ What is his tone?” Cold-call students (matter of fact, to the point). “What does this reveal about Vladek’s character?” Cold-call students. (Vladek is practical and likes to be in control.)</p></li>
<li><p>Prompt students to write down their answers on their Close Reading note-catcher.</p></li>
<li><p>Explain that, as we keep going, we will continue to think about things Vladek does and says, and how this helps us better understand his overall character. This way, we will keep learning more about his character over the course of the book.</p></li>

<li><p>Cold-call students to share their answer.</p></li>
