(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** After the close read, answer the following questions.

1.  How would you describe the tone the author’s words create on page 23, panels 5 and 6, when Vladek says: “But this isn’t so proper, so respectful . . . I can tell you other stories but such private things, I don’t want you should mention.” What does this reveal about Vladek’s character? What evidence makes you think so? (RL.8.1, RL.8.3, RL.8.4)

In your response, be sure to include

- a description of the tone that Vladek’s statement creates,

- evidence from the text that supports your description of Vladek’s tone, and

- an explanation of what the statement reveals about Vladek’s character.

Vladek’s statement creates a tone of privacy and respectfulness. Instead of being cold towards Lucia, Vladek is asking Art to keep her story private. The beginning of the statement, “this isn’t so proper” makes it clear that Vladek is trying to do what is right and avoid any disrespect. The ellipses show a hesitance and thoughtfulness in Vladek’s words. This reserved tone reveals that Vladek is a private and thoughtful character.
