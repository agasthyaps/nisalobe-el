6.  What words or phrases in the sentences helped you understand the tone?

The author used the words “beautiful,” “truly,” and “love,” which helped me understand that the speaker is admiring someone’s dress. “Truly” helped me understand that the speaker is being sincere.

7.  What is the tone of the following sentences? “You look <u>so</u> beautiful. What, is that your <u>grandmother’s</u> dress?”

8.  sad and wistful

9.  sincere and admiring

10. <u>mean and sarcastic</u>

11. bored and disinterested

12. What words or phrases in the sentences helped you understand the tone?

I know the speaker is being sarcastic because even though they say the dress is beautiful, they ask if it belongs to someone’s grandmother. I associate grandmother’s clothes with things that are old, out of date, and even ugly—not beautiful. This comment is mean because the speaker is actually saying the dress is ugly or old, not beautiful.
