**Model Whole-Book Literary Summary: *Summer of the Mariposas***

In *Summer of the Mariposas* by Guadalupe Garcia McCall, Odilia Garza and her four sisters set out on a journey from Texas to Mexico and back again. Along the way, they encounter many magical adventures and learn many life lessons through challenges and struggle. At the beginning of the story, we meet the Garza sisters, who live in Texas with their mother, who works long hours. The girls mostly look after themselves and each other. When the sisters find a dead body in a river, they decide to drive to Mexico, determined to find the dead man’s family and to visit their grandmother. As their journey unfolds, the girls encounter many supernatural creatures, including La Llorona, a witch, a warlock, half-human barn owls, and chupacabras, all of which connect to myths from Latin American folklore. The most important of these is La Llorona, who helps Odilia and the girls throughout the story when they are in danger. Early in the book, La Llorona gives Odilia a magical earring that keeps her and her sisters from danger. Eventually, Odilia and her sisters reach their grandmother’s house and rest before returning home. When they arrive back in Texas, exhausted, their father is there and things are tense and difficult for the family. The girls are quite upset to learn that their father wants their mother to move out of their home so he can live there with his new wife and her children with Odilia and her sisters. Throughout the novel, the theme of maternal love is emphasized through Odilia’s relationship with La Llorona, who watches over the Garza sisters like a mother. In the end, the story and La Llorona’s message remind us of the strength of a mother’s love and protection. This reminds us that if are kind and to do things with a pure heart, we will be safe.
