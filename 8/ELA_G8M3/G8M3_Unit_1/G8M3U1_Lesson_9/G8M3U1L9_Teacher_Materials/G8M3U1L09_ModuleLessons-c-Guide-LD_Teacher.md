5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

L.8.1b, L.8.3a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

Early in the book, **La Llorona gives Odilia a magical earring that keeps her and her sisters from danger**. (from Model Whole-Book Literary Summary: *Summer of the Mariposas*)

**Lesson 9 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive in Opening B.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target (**I can form and use active and passive voice to achieve particular effects**) and L.8.1b and L.8.3a. by providing an opportunity for students to analyze a verb written in the active voice. The author’s use of the active voice serves to emphasize the subject carrying out the action in the sentence.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses a verb in the active voice with the purpose of drawing attention to the subject of the verb to emphasize the actor.

- Transfer: subject + verb used in Part I selected response questions and summary writing on the End of Unit 1 Assessment and in future writing tasks in Module 4

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **Early in the book, <u>La Llorona gives Odilia a magical earring that keeps her and her sisters from danger</u>**.

- Ask:

“What is this sentence about?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **La Llorona gives Odilia a magical earring that keeps her and her sisters from danger.**

- Ask:

“Can you figure out the subject in this clause?” (La Llorona.)

“What action is La Llorona carrying out?” (She gives a magical earring to Odilia.)

“Who is the indirect object and recipient of this action?” (Odilia.)

“What is the direct object of the verb and the item that is directly connected to the action?” (A magical earring that keeps her and her sisters from danger.)

“Is this chunk written in active or passive voice? Why do you think that?” (Active voice. The subject is at the beginning of the sentence, and the verb is formed using the simple present tense rather than a passive construction \[be + verb + -ed/-en\].)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **Early in the book, <u>La Llorona gives Odilia a magical earring that keeps her and her sisters from danger</u>**.

- Ask:

“Can you figure out why the writer used active voice in this sentence?” (To emphasize that the subject, La Llorona, is carrying out the action.)

- Say:

“There are two ways we can write this sentence in passive voice:”

- A magical earring that keeps her and her sisters from danger is given to Odilia by La Llorona.

- Odilia is given a magical earring that keeps her and her sisters from danger by La Llorona.

“How does the emphasis in these two sentences differ?” (The emphasis is on whatever comes at the beginning of the sentence; in the first sentence, the earring is the focus, and in the second sentence, Odilia is the focus.)

- Note: To help students build further understanding of how the active and passive voices create emphasis by placing focus on the subject or object at the beginning of a sentence, invite students to close their eyes and listen while each passive sentence is read aloud. Give students 30 seconds to discuss what they envisioned.

- For an increased level of challenge, and as time allows, invite students to grapple with rewriting the sentence from active to passive voice before displaying the sentences above.

- Ask:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target: ‘I can form and use active and passive voice to achieve particular effects’?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display the following sentence and sentence frame:

Vladek burned the diaries that Art’s mother wrote.

> .

object + **be** + verb + **-ed**/**-en** + **by** + subject

- Say:

“Rewrite the sentence from active to passive voice to shift the emphasis from the agent carrying out the action (subject) to the item that is burned (object).”

- Possible student answers:

**<u>The diaries that Art’s mother wrote were burned by Vladek</u>**.

object + **be** + verb + **-ed**/**-en** + **by** + subject
