Be aware that these steps may vary depending on the podcast software used:

1.  Upload the recording of your script. Listen to it, and rerecord as necessary. The script becomes the main track. Music and sound effect tracks will then be layered above or below the main track.

1.  Add sound effects and music by uploading, recording, or selecting sound effects from the program.

2.  Insert the sound effect or music clip where it belongs in your script. Listen to the script, and place the clip just below or above that spot. Drag and drop clips and/or shorten them as needed. Consider volume so that listeners can hear the script over the sound effects and music. Adjust the volume of the clip as needed.

3.  For sound effects or music to interrupt the script, record the script in pieces. Then add the sound effects or music in between the pieces.
