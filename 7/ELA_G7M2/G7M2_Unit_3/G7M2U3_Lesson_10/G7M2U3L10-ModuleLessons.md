Grade 7: Module 2: Unit 3: Lesson 10

Lesson Overview

Lesson Summary

In triads, students practice their podcast presentation, focusing on adequate volume, clarity of speech, and use of formal English when necessary. Then students present their podcast to another triad and receive feedback on volume, clarity, and formal English. Triads debrief the Tuning protocol to ensure they are ready to present their podcasts to the class in the end of unit assessment.

Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.7.5 – Opening A: On an entrance ticket, students record one thing they developed and strengthened in their writing based on feedback from peers.

- SL.7.4 – Work Time A: Students practice presenting their podcast, focusing on volume, pronunciation, enunciation, and emphasis.

- SL.7.4 – Work Time B: Students engage in a Tuning protocol to practice and improve presentation skills such as adequate volume and clear pronunciation.

- SL.7.4 – Closing and Assessment A: Students debrief the Tuning protocol for adequate volume and clear pronunciation.

- Students focus on working to contribute to a better world by improving their presentation skills for the class, the school, the community, and even the world.

- The Tuning protocol is used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- Student triads practice presenting their script before and during the Tuning Protocol. Based on how the presentation went, triads may need to reconsider who will read the narrative lead, dividing it among each member of the triad or asking one member to read the whole lead in addition to their section.

- If homework is not an option for students, then allow several minutes at the end of this lesson or the beginning of Lesson 11 for students to apply the feedback from their peers.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release more responsibility more quickly to students as they comprehend the tasks or concepts. For example:

- Allow those students who are skilled with presentation skills to offer their services as “expert presenters” to other groups who may need some modeling of presentation skills.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students focused on revising their podcast script for content. In this lesson, students expand on this work while also looking more closely at how to improve the oral presentation of their podcast script.

Support All Students

- The subject matter of the podcast scripts may include descriptions of death and disease. Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of the podcast scripts needs to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually.

- Students may need additional support providing feedback in the Tuning protocol. They may need to listen to their classmates’ podcast script presentation more than once. Provide these students with a copy of the script for them to read ahead of time to familiarize themselves with the content and possible issues they may recommend. Also, if possible, create a recording of the presentations and give students the opportunity to listen to the recording multiple times, in a quieter space, before providing feedback. ▲

- Provide students with the opportunity to move to quieter spaces in the classroom, or use “office cubbies” to support their focus during the presentation practice and Tuning protocol. ▲

- Invite students to voice record their revisions to their podcast script if writing or typing while listening to feedback is too challenging. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson provides students with the opportunity to collaborate on practicing, tuning, and revising their podcast scripts. This extensive collaboration in each activity ensures comprehension of and success on the tasks throughout the lesson.

- ELLs may find it challenging to present their work to others. Ensure students who are most reluctant to share are in supportive groups for their Tuning protocol by placing them in homogenous groups by level or their home language, if possible.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, and 7.I.C.10.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Presentation checklists to ensure success on the End of Unit 3 Assessment.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will deliver their podcast scripts for the End of Unit 3 Assessment.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.7.5 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 10**.

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, invite them to review their responses in their podcast triads. Ensure that revisions are related to the **Presentation checklists**, as opposed to minor conventions edits.

- Repeated routine: follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Practice Podcast Presentation – SL.7.4 (15 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can use adequate volume and clear pronunciation.”

“I can adapt my speech for a podcast, using formal English when appropriate.”

- Ask students to retrieve their Presentation checklists, and focus on the following criteria:

- SL.7.4: I use adequate volume. I use clear pronunciation.

- SL.7.6: I adapt speech to a variety of contexts and tasks, demonstrating command of formal English when indicated or appropriate.

- L.7.3: I can use knowledge of language and its conventions when speaking.

- Invite students to mark or highlight these criteria, as they will be the focus of the Tuning protocol. Then have students Turn and Talk to say the criteria in their own words, recording these paraphrases in the third column of their Presentation checklists. As necessary, model doing so with one of the criteria, recording paraphrases on the board for students to reference. Consult the **Presentation checklist (for teacher reference)** for sample responses.

- Ask students to retrieve their **podcast scripts**. Explain that they will practice presenting their podcast with their triads, coaching one another on adequate volume, clear pronunciation, and formal English. Remind students that they will each read the section of the script they wrote and that one or more of the members of the triad should read the narrative lead. (See Teaching Notes for suggestions on dividing the narrative lead.)

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time A, challenge students to model reading their portion of their podcast script with appropriate volume, pace, clarity, and emphasis. Then they can coach their classmates who need heavier support on their presentation skills.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time A, students may be overwhelmed by the many presentation skills (volume, pacing, clarity, emphasis). Encourage students to work on only one or two skills each time they practice their presentation.

Work Time

B. Tuning Protocol: Presentation Skills – SL.7.4 (20 minutes)

- Explain that they will now present their podcast to another triad to get feedback on their presentation skills.

- Move students into groups with their own podcast triad and another podcast triad, and invite them to label their groups A and B.

- Distribute **sticky notes**.

- Focus students on the **Work to Contribute to a Better World anchor chart**, specifically: “I use my strengths to help others grow.” Remind students that as they work to critique the other triad’s work, they will need to use their strengths.

- Tell students they are going to provide the other triad with kind, specific, and helpful feedback against the criterion.

- Direct students’ attention to the **Peer Critique anchor chart**, and remind them of what peer critique looks and sounds like.

- Display and distribute **Directions for Tuning Protocol**, and review them as necessary. Remind students that they have participated in a Tuning protocol in the previous lesson. Invite students to share issues, solutions, and best practices for Tuning protocols.

- Ask students to retrieve their podcast scripts and Presentation checklists and encourage them to provide feedback to their classmates based on the Presentation checklist. Remind students to consider their peers’ use of language. Are they using formal English when appropriate and informal English when appropriate? Are they using conventions so that everyone can understand what they mean?

- Circulate to support students as they work to give feedback to one another. Emphasize that students are not to make revisions yet, as they will be doing this later in the lesson.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time B, provide sentence frames for students to use in giving feedback. For example:

- Your volume/pacing/clarity/emphasis was good because I could . . .

- Next time you present, can you try . . . because . . .

Closing and Assessment

A. Debrief Tuning Protocol – SL.7.4 (5 minutes)

- Invite students to debrief the Tuning Protocol. Ask the following questions:

“What did you enjoy about the Tuning Protocol?”

“What are you taking away from this process related to presentation skills?”

“How will you improve your presentation tomorrow based on the Tuning Protocol?”

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Revise the Podcast Script

- Students use the suggestions developed in class in the Tuning Protocol and Closing and Assessment A to improve their podcast presentation.

B. Practice Presentation

- Students practice presenting their part of the script, reading it aloud slowly, clearly, and with enunciation and emphasis.
