**Directions:** Design your own note-catcher to record the evidence and sources you use to answer your research question. You may also want to include a section on your note-catcher to assess the credibility and relevance of your sources and any questions raised by the source.

Students create their own note-catchers, which will vary. Sample note-catcher below.
