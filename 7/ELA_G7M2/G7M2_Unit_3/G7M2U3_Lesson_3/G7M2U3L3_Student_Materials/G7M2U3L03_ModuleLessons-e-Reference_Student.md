**Choose and Use Credible Internet Sources**

You can determine whether an internet source is reliable by identifying the publisher, author, bias, accuracy, and timeliness of the source.

- **Publisher**: A reliable internet source is usually published by the government (.gov), educational institutions (.edu), or nonprofit organizations (.org). Sometimes internet sources published by commercial organizations (.com) are reliable, but not always.

- **Author**: You can tell whether an internet source is accurate by looking at who wrote it and checking the writer’s credentials.

- **Bias**: An internet source that presents both sides of an argument or does not have any bias and that presents facts is also usually reliable.

- **Accuracy**: A reliable internet source should be visually appealing, clean, and uncluttered, with links that work. It should not have many errors in spelling or grammar.

- **Timeliness**: An internet source that is reliable is timely; it does not have out-of-date information.

**Quote Accurately**

- Copy the exact words as written from the text.

- Give the page number that the quote is from.

- Use quotation marks (“quote”) to show the words that have come word for word from the text.

- If using “he said,” “she said,” or “it says,” for example, put a comma before the quotation marks (On page 30 Miguel said, “quote.”).

**Cite Sources**

- Author name Last, First. *Title of text*. Publisher, Date of publication, Pages.

- Author name Last, First M. “Article Title.” *Website Title,* Website Publisher, Date Month Year Published. Web. Date Month Year Accessed.
