End of Unit 3 Assessment: Present Podcast Script

(For Teacher Reference)

In triads, students present their podcast script about an epidemic they researched. Each member of the triad presents one portion of the script. Students are assessed using a Presentation rubric on how well they present their findings; emphasis of salient points; coherence of descriptions, facts, details, and examples; and more. Students are also assessed on adequate volume, clear pronunciation, use of formal English, and strong use of the conventions of English. (SL.7.4, SL.7.6, L.7.3a, L.7.6)

Ideally these presentations would be recorded so that teachers can more easily assess the skills and so that students can use the recordings in their performance task. Triads can present their speech either to the whole class or to small groups.
