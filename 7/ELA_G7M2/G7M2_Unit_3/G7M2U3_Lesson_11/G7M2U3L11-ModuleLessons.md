Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.7.10 – Closing and Assessment A: Students share their reading and comprehension of literary nonfiction in the Grades 6–8 text-complexity band proficiently.

- For the End of Unit 3 Assessment, students present their podcast script, focusing on presenting their findings in a coherent manner, emphasizing salient points, and using adequate volume and clear pronunciation. Students also adapt their speech for the podcast, using formal English when appropriate. (SL.7.4, SL.7.6, L.7.3, L.7.6)

- In this lesson, students focus on working to contribute to a better world by presenting their knowledge for the class.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release more responsibility more quickly to students as they comprehend the tasks or concepts. For example:

- Allow those students who are confident public speakers to coach students who are less confident with tips and strategies. Allow time before the presentations for these students to coach others. Ask these expert students to present first to model strong presentation skills.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students have focused on revising their podcast script for content and improving their presentation skills. In this lesson, students synthesize their growth with content and presentation skills to create more than they thought possible.

Support All Students

- The subject matter of the podcast script presentations may include descriptions of death and disease. Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of the podcast scripts needs to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually.

- Students may need additional support having the courage to present in front of their peers. Provide strategies such as calming breathing techniques, positive visualization techniques, and discussion of crew support. Consider alternatives such as presenting in small groups or one-on-one while other students are engaged in other activities. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson consists of tasks students have practiced throughout the second half of the unit. This gradual release supports students in independent achievement on this assessment.

- ELLs may find it challenging to give a presentation for an assessment. Assure students that skills like volume, pacing, clarity, and emphasis are not contingent on language acquisition abilities. In other words, students can succeed at these skills even if they are newcomers or beginners.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, and 7.I.C.10.

Assessment Guidance

- Assessment materials (student copy, answer key with sample student responses, Presentation rubric) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources. When assessing and providing feedback on this assessment, use the Presentation rubric.

- For large classes, consider dividing the class into smaller groups and giving each group a device for them to record the presentations for assessment purposes and for use in the performance task.

Down the Road

- In the next lessons, students will create their final podcast by uploading their recording from today’s end of unit assessment, or by re-recording, and then sound editing with sound effects and music.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Return students’ **Mid-Unit 3 Assessments with feedback**, and allow students time to review feedback and write their name on the board if they require support.

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 11**. Students may or may not choose to share their goals for this assessment with a partner.

- Repeated routine: follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. End-of-Unit 3 Assessment: Present Podcast Script (25 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can present findings in a focused and coherent manner, emphasizing salient points.”

“I can use appropriate eye contact, adequate volume, and clear pronunciation.”

“I can adapt my speech for a podcast, using formal English when appropriate.”

- Inform students that over the course of this lesson, they will complete an end of unit assessment by presenting their podcast script. Remind students of their work throughout lessons 7–10, improving their narrative writing and presentation skills.

- Ask students to retrieve their copies of the **Presentation checklist**. Distribute the **End of Unit 3 Assessment: Podcast Script Presentations**.

- Read aloud the assessment while students follow along. Answer clarifying questions.

- Before students begin to present, incorporate reflection on and awareness of the following academic mindsets: “This work has value for me.” “I can succeed at this.” and “My ability and competence grow with my effort.”

- Ask:

“What value does the task of a presentation have for you beyond this class? Why?” (Responses will vary, but may include: this task has a lot of value for me because I will continue to make presentations in most of my high school and college classes, and in my work life as well.)

“What will help you succeed on this assessment?” (Responses will vary, but may include: Improving my performance based on the feedback and revisions gained from the Tuning protocols in Lessons 8 and 9 will help me do well on this assessment. Taking a deep breath and calming myself down before I begin speaking will also help.)

“How has your ability and competence grown with your effort?” (Responses will vary, but may include: As my group revised and responded to feedback, our podcast script and our presentation improved. We worked really hard to make it better, and it shows.)

- Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners** and the **Work to Contribute to a Better World anchor charts**. Review perseverance and collaboration. Remind students that because they will be challenging themselves with a presentation and working to perform as a group, they will need these skills. Review “I apply my learning to help our school, the community, and the environment.” Remind students that because they will turn this recording into a podcast, they will share it with a wider audience than this classroom, which will contribute to a better world.

- Invite students to retrieve their **podcast scripts** and begin the assessment. Record each presentation. Use the recording to assess presentation skills on the **Presentation rubric**. For large classes, consider dividing the class into smaller groups and giving each a device to record the presentations for assessment purposes and for use in the performance task.

- Remind students who are not presenting to remain silent so that the recordings will be as clean as possible for use in the performance task.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- Before the end of unit assessment in Work Time A, encourage students to quietly practice their presentations in their triads to ensure they are ready to present them to a larger group.

For Heavier Support

- Before the end of unit assessment in Work Time A, encourage students to quietly practice their presentations in their triads to ensure they are ready to present them to a larger group.

Closing and Assessment

A. Independent Research Reading Share – RI.7.10 (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to guide students to share their independent research reading, reminding students that the purpose of research reading is to build their content knowledge, domain-specific vocabulary, and achievement on reading complex texts.

- Refer to the **Independent Reading Sample Plans** (see the Tools Page: http://eled.org/tools) to guide students through a research reading share, or use another routine.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- During Closing and Assessment A, students share with a partner the independent research reading book they have been reading. Sharing about their book will ensure students are engaged with the book and give them an opportunity to find a different one if they are no longer interested in their choice. As necessary, review the purpose of independent research reading. Emphasize the benefits of reading multiple texts on the same topic (e.g., repeated exposure to relevant vocabulary).
