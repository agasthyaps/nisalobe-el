5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

W.7.4, L.7.1a, L.7.2a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

**Without a calm, measured approach,** we will end up causing panic instead of finding a cure. (from page 3 of Model Podcast Script: “Story of the Epidemic of 1994” by EL Education)

**Lesson 2 Placement**

Lead this Mini after students analyze a model podcast script in Work Time A.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target **(I can determine the purpose and content of an effective podcast script about an epidemic.)** and W.7.4 by drawing students’ attention to a sentence that conveys a key takeaway from the content of a podcast script. The sentence also helps students to address L.7.1a and L.7.2a by providing an opportunity to explain the function of a phrase that contains coordinate adjectives.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses an adverbial phrase with the purpose of describing the action in the main clause of a sentence. This phrase is particularly interesting because it contains coordinate adjectives that are instrumental to the meaning of the sentence.

- Transfer: preposition + adjective, + adjective + noun used to add information to a sentence when writing a podcast script in preparation for the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **<u>Without a calm, measured approach,</u> we will end up causing panic instead of finding a cure.**

- Ask:

“What is the central idea of this sentence?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **Without a calm, measured approach,**

- Ask:

“What is the meaning of the preposition without?” (to not have something)

“What do you think a ‘calm, measured approach’ is?” (a way of doing something carefully and quietly, without nervousness)

- Note: As needed, allow students to consult a dictionary to determine or verify the meaning of each word in this phrase.

“Why do you think the writer used a comma between the words calm and measured?”  
(to clearly separate two coordinate adjectives describing the same noun)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **<u>Without a calm, measured approach,</u> we will end up causing panic instead of finding a cure.**

- Ask:

“Can you figure out the function of this phrase? Is it a noun phrase, an adjective phrase, or an adverbial phrase? How do you know?” (It’s an adverbial phrase. We know this because it starts with a preposition and it adds more information about the main clause in the sentence.)

“What happens to the sentence if we move Without a calm, measured approach to the end of the sentence?” (The meaning stays the same.)

“Why do you think the writer started the sentence with this adverbial phrase instead of putting it after the main clause?” (to emphasize the information within it)

“Why would the writer end the podcast script with this information?” (Because it is a central idea and a key takeaway. By including this information at the end of the podcast, it is more likely that listeners will remember it.)

- Ask:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target: ‘I can determine the purpose and content of an effective podcast script about an epidemic’?” (Responses will vary.)
