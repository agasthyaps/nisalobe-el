![](media/image1.png) Guiding Questions and Big Ideas

What are epidemics? How do they develop?

- *Epidemics can be medical or social. There are similarities and differences to epidemics, depending on whether they are social or medical in nature.*

- *Social epidemics can be positive or negative.*

- *Epidemics spread through contagion as well as social networks.*

How do people respond to an epidemic?

- *People’s response to epidemics affects their overall impact. When people respond with positive character traits and logic, epidemics can be contained. When people respond with fear and selfishness, epidemics often spread.*

What is the role of character and mindset in solving epidemic crises?

- *Epidemiologists can respond to epidemics with integrity, initiative, responsibility, and perseverance. Doctors or caregivers can respond to patients with compassion, respect, and empathy.*

What methods and tools help people to solve epidemics?

- *People use logic, the scientific method, and innovation to solve mysterious epidemics.*

What will your student be doing at school?

In Unit 3, students work in small groups to create a podcast about a social or medical epidemic that concerns them or their community. Over the course of the unit, students choose an epidemic topic, conduct research, write a script for their podcast, and use technology to record and sound edit their podcast. Students begin this podcast creation by listening to an exemplar podcast and reading a model podcast script about an outbreak of the plague in India. Students analyze what makes this model podcast strong and build a list of criteria for success from their observations. Students then begin researching to gather information for their podcast, participating in a series of mini-lessons as needed to review research skills learned in Module 1, such as: refining research questions, creating a research note-catcher, generating search terms, evaluating the relevance and credibility of sources, etc. Additionally, students consider how individuals, events, and ideas in their epidemic interact as they research. For the mid-unit assessment, students first read an article and answer questions to analyze the interaction of individuals, events, and ideas in a text. In the second part of the mid-unit assessment, students conduct their own research to answer a question prompted by the article read in the first part of the assessment.

In the second half of Unit 3, students work in their small groups to plan, write, and create their podcast. First, each member of the group drafts a narrative opening to the group script, being sure to include narrative elements such as a hook, characters, and the important events of the epidemic. Then the groups combine and refine these narratives into one strong lead for their podcast script, being sure to include narrative techniques such as dialogue, pacing, and description. Students then divide the rest of the script-writing among the members of their group to write the remaining three sections of the script: the social and scientific ideas, the tools/mindsets/habits of character, and the message or lessons learned. Based on peer feedback, students revise their script to present their research findings in a coherent and engaging way. Students also practice presenting their scripts in their groups, receiving feedback on presentation skills like volume and clarity. For their end of unit assessment, students present their script to their classmates, focusing on all the skills they practiced throughout the unit. Students end the module by turning their podcast presentations into actual podcast recordings with music and sound effects. Students use sound-editing skills as well as collaboration to produce a high-quality podcast to publish for their classmates, community, or even the world by posting it online.

Throughout the unit, as students research, they trace the habits of character that people demonstrate —such as respect, empathy, collaboration, initiative, responsibility, perseverance, citizenship, and service—as they solve medical mysteries and take care of the sick. Additionally, students focus on respect, empathy, and compassion as they respond to one another’s ideas and skills in written work and in discussions. Students also practice collaboration and taking initiative during discussions. They practice integrity and perseverance as they work independently on assessments. And they take responsibility for their own learning as they track progress on their assessments.

In this unit, students continue to read nonfiction texts at their level as they choose independent research reading texts. Students should complete 20 minutes of independent research reading for homework when they are not reading a chapter from the anchor text. Students should also continue independent research reading over weekends.

How can you support your student at home?

Talk with your student about social and medical epidemics or how germs, ideas, behaviors, and emotions spread among people.

Listen to podcasts (if possible, about epidemics), and discuss:

- What makes this podcast interesting? What sound effects and music do the producers use? How do the sound effects and music help emphasize important points?

- How do the speakers organize their information? Do they tell a story? How else do they organize the information?

- Do the speakers use formal or informal English? What is the effect of the formal or informal English?

Also, support students with practicing their podcast script (see homework in Lessons 9 and 10 in the chart below).

Unit 3: Homework

In Lessons 1–4, students prepare to draft their podcast script by engaging in activities such as listening to a podcast, recording and refining research questions, and synthesizing their research.

In Lessons 2–6, homework focuses on preparing for and practicing the mid-unit assessment skills of analyzing the interactions among individuals, events, and ideas.

In Lessons 5–8, students conduct research reading in which they read a topic-related book of choice and answer a question related to the unit’s ideas and skills.

In Lessons 7–10, students continue to work on the draft of their podcast script by finishing the draft of their narrative lead, revising the script, and conducting more research.

In Lessons 9–10, students prepare for their end of unit assessment presentation by practicing their presentations.

In Lessons 11–13, students work on their podcast performance task by engaging in activities such as planning for rerecording their podcast, listening to an exemplar podcast, creating an image for their podcast, and publishing their podcast beyond the classroom.

Independent Reading

**Directions:** Remember to record responses to research reading in the front of your independent reading journal and responses to choice reading in the back. Try to choose a different prompt each time.

Record any new vocabulary in your vocabulary log. Underline vocabulary found during independent reading.

Record:

- Date

- Title and author of your reading book

- Pages you have read

- Prompt

- Response

Example:

<u>Date:</u> 02/17/19

<u>Book Title and Author</u>: *Patient Zero*

<u>Pages Read:</u> Chapter 1

<u>Prompt:</u> How does the writer organize information? By telling a story? Or in a different way?

<u>Response:</u> The writer tells a story in the white sections. Then in the red and black sections, the writer organizes the information in different ways, such as by explanation, chronology (in order by time), problem solution, and argument.

Consider using the following independent reading prompts.[^1]

- What text features or techniques does the writer use to emphasize important points?

- How does the writer organize information? By telling a story? Or in a different way?

- Does the writer use formal or informal English? What is the effect of the formal or informal English?

- If you were to use this information in a podcast, how would you change it? What sound effects and music would you use? Where? Why?

- Choose one new word from your reading today, and analyze it on a vocabulary square.

|                                               |                                        |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Definition in your own words                  | Synonyms (words with the same meaning) |
| Words with the same affix or root             | Sketch                                 |
| Translation in home language (if appropriate) |                                        |

Vocabulary

**Directions:** In the classroom, you have been recording words from your texts in your vocabulary log. Throughout this unit, you have been research reading topic-related books at home to build your knowledge of social and medical epidemics and recording words in your independent reading journal.

Choose a word from your research reading or from a text you’ve read in class, and add the word to your vocabulary log. Try to choose a different word to add and to practice a different vocabulary strategy each time. For each word, be sure to add the following:

1.  The definition, or meaning, of the word

<!-- -->

10. The vocabulary strategy you used to figure out the meaning of the word

11. A sketch or diagram that helps you to better understand the meaning of the word

Record new vocabulary in vocabulary logs, and mark academic vocabulary with a symbol—for example a star:

- Academic vocabulary: Words you might find in informational texts on many different topics. For example, the words *evidence* and *rationale* are words that could be found in books on any topic.

- Domain-specific vocabulary: Words about a particular topic. For example, the words *tadpoles*, *frogspawn*, and *amphibian* are some that would be found on the topic of frogs.

Vocabulary Strategies

As a reminder, the vocabulary strategies we’ve been working on in class are:

- Context: read the sentence around the word.

- Look at the affixes for clues.

- Look at the root of the word for clues.

- Use a dictionary.

- Discuss the word with another person (after attempting some of the above strategies).

[^1]: Some of the prompts will not be appropriate for the text students are reading. Invite students to choose a prompt that works for the text they have just read.
