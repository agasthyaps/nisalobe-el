Epidemics

Grade 7: Module 2: Unit 3: Lesson 9

Lesson Overview

Lesson Summary

Students work in their triads to combine all the independently written sections to create a complete podcast script, revising for wordiness and redundancy. Students then present their podcast script to another triad in a Tuning protocol, receiving feedback on the organization and content of the script. Triads make a plan for revision based on the feedback from the Tuning protocol.

Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- SL.7.4– Opening A: On an entrance ticket, students discuss the most important skills for effective presentations.

- SL.7.4 – Work Time A: Students collaborate to combine and revise their podcast scripts, focusing on presenting their findings, descriptions, facts, and details in a coherent manner.

- SL.7.4 – Work Time B: Students present their podcast scripts to another small group in a Tuning protocol, to receive feedback on arrangement of findings, descriptions, facts, details, and other elements in the podcast script.

- W.7.5 – Closing and Assessment A: Students make a plan for revising their podcast scripts, based on feedback in the Tuning protocol.

- Students focus on becoming effective learners as they collaborate with partners to combine and revise their podcast scripts. They also work on contributing to a better world by using their strengths to help others grow as they offer kind, specific, and helpful feedback during the Tuning protocol.

- The Think-Pair-Share and Tuning protocols are used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- Student triads practice presenting their script before and during the Tuning protocol. Triads must determine who will present the narrative lead. Each member of the triad must present the section they wrote. Suggest that one student read the lead in addition to their section; or that they divide up the lead into beginning, middle, and end and each member of the triad reads one part; or that group members assume the role of particular “characters” in the script, reading the appropriate lines of dialogue.

- Note that while the SL.7.4 standard calls for students to present “claims and findings,” students will present findings in this module and claims and findings in their presentations in Module 4, when they have learned how to make and support a claim.

- If homework is not an option, then in Work Time A of Lesson 10 they can revise before and after they practice their portion of the podcast script.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release more responsibility more quickly to students as they comprehend the tasks or concepts. For example:

- If students finish revising and practicing their script, encourage them to partner with other groups to help them revise their scripts.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students have focused on writing and revising sections of their podcast scripts independently. In this lesson, they work together to combine their sections into a single script and practice presenting in order to receive feedback on the arrangement and content of the script.

Support All Students

- Note there is a differentiated version of Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 9 used in Opening A in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Students may need additional support engaging in a productive Tuning protocol with peers. Consider modeling a productive exchange and highlighting exemplary feedback for groups who may need extra support. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson provides students with the opportunity to collaborate on combining, revising, tuning, and planning for more revisions on the podcast script. This extensive collaboration in each activity ensures comprehension of and success on the tasks throughout the lesson.

- ELLs may find it challenging to offer feedback to their peers in a Tuning protocol. They may not be accustomed to giving feedback on another’s work. As necessary, assure students that they will give both positive and helpful feedback, which is not the same as passing judgment on the person. Also, explain that peer critique is beneficial to both the reviewer and reviewee to evaluate when something is well done or needs more work.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, 7.I.C.10, 7.I.C.12, 7.II.B.5, 7.II.C.6, and 7.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- Monitor students’ discussion around combining and revising their scripts and preparing for the Tuning protocol to ensure that they understand the expectations for the Tuning protocol and final scripts.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will practice their presentation before engaging in another Tuning protocol for feedback on presentation skills.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – SL.7.4 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 9** and **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 9** ▲, as necessary. The differentiated entrance ticket supports students in writing responses with a word bank and sentence starters. ▲

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, ask for volunteers to share their responses to the discussion prompts, as well as examples of how they may revise their scripts to prepare for their presentations.

- Repeated routine: follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

- With students, use the vocabulary strategies on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart** to deconstruct the words *findings* (information found; conclusions drawn), *emphasize* (to give special attention to; to stress), *salient* (extremely noticeable or important), and *coherent* (logically ordered or connected). Record on the **academic word wall** with translations in home languages, where appropriate, and invite students to record the words in their **vocabulary logs**.

For Lighter Support

- For the entrance ticket, allow a few minutes for students to first record some ideas before discussing with their classmates to give them an opportunity to generate ideas and solidify their language use.

For Heavier Support

- Invite students to use the Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 9 ▲. This resource supports students’ oral language production and comprehension with sentence frames. Students may also benefit from a few minutes to complete the sentence frames in writing before sharing them with peers.

Work Time

A. Combine and Revise Podcast Script – SL.7.4 (15 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can present my findings in a focused and coherent manner, emphasizing salient points.”

“I can use include relevant descriptions, facts, details, and examples to help the listener understand my epidemic.”

- Inform students they will combine and revise their podcast scripts, focusing on the content and language of the scripts. Tell students that today’s lesson will provide an opportunity to think more deeply about how listeners will understand the information in their script.

- Ask:

“What are some of the ways we might revise a piece of writing if we intend for people to listen to it, instead of reading it?” (Responses will vary, but may include: We should think about how people only get to listen to things once, usually, so we should focus on making sentences simple and clear. We can also think of ways to revise our writing to emphasize different words or sentences when we speak.)

- Display and distribute the **Presentation checklist**. Inform students that as they combine their scripts today, they will use the first three rows of this checklist. Read aloud the first three rows. Then ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“How will the first three criteria on the Presentation checklist help you make decisions about the content and language of your presentation?” (The Presentation checklist focuses on “emphasizing salient points” and presenting findings in a “focused and coherent” way, which helps remind us to really focus on emphasizing what is most important in a spoken presentation.)

- Confirm for students that the Presentation checklist will help them consider how to refine the content and language of their written scripts so that their podcasts will be effective when the scripts are read aloud.

- Allow several minutes for students to generate criteria for the third column of the first three rows of the Presentation checklist based on this discussion. Students can work independently or in triads. Circulate to identify any criteria to review as a class, using the **Presentation checklist (for teacher reference)** for sample criteria as necessary.

- Invite students to join with their triads and retrieve their **podcast scripts** to begin combining and making revisions to their scripts, focusing on transitions between sections; using clear, concise language to present findings about the epidemic and highlight important points; and including pertinent facts, details, and examples in each section. Students should retrieve their **Epidemic Research note-catcher** to make sure they have included all the important facts, details, and examples in all the sections of their podcast script.

- Circulate to support students as they work. Ask questions to guide their thinking:

“What are the key findings you want to include about the epidemic?” (For students who need more support, ask, “What did you learn about the epidemic? Where did you include that information in your script?” ▲)

“Do you present your findings in a focused and coherent manner?” (For students who need more support, ask, “Do you tell the events of the epidemic in order? Do you use transition words between paragraphs and sections?” ▲)

“Do you emphasize salient points?” (For students who need more support, ask, “Do you have an exciting hook or opening? Do you end with a message and reflection on the epidemic?” ▲)

“Do you use descriptions, facts, details, and examples to help the reader understand your epidemic?” (For students who need more support, ask, “Do you include dialogue and description to make some events seem exciting?” ▲)

- Invite students to record “Y” for *Yes* and the date in the final column of their Presentation checklist if they feel the criteria marked on their checklist have been achieved in their writing in this lesson.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time A, challenge students as they revise their podcast script to include *that* to join clauses, empty subject *it*, and passive voice each at least once.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time A, students may be reluctant to share their section of the podcast script with their triad. If time allows, work with students to edit their section to ensure they feel comfortable sharing with their triad and in the Tuning protocol.

Work Time

B. Tuning Protocol: Content – SL.7.4 (20 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can offer kind, specific and helpful feedback to my peers.”

- Explain that they will now share their script with another triad to get feedback on the content. Allow several minutes for triads to determine who will read the narrative lead. (See Teaching Notes for suggestions on dividing the narrative lead.) Other sections will be read by the person who wrote the section.

- Move students into groups with their own podcast triad and another podcast triad, and invite them to label their groups A and B.

- Distribute **sticky notes**.

- Focus students on the **Work to Contribute to a Better World anchor chart**, specifically: “I use my strengths to help others grow.” Remind students that as they work to critique the other triad’s work, they will need to use their strengths.

- Tell students they are going to provide the other triad with kind, specific, and helpful feedback against the first three criterion on the Presentation Checklist.

- Direct students’ attention to the **Peer Critique anchor chart**, and remind them of what peer critique looks and sounds like.

- Display and distribute **Directions for Tuning Protocol**, and read them aloud for the group. Invite students to ask questions to ensure that they understand the protocol. Remind them of the Tuning protocol they participated in during Unit 2.

- Tell students that for this Tuning protocol and the one in the next lesson, those students giving feedback can play the role of producers, who are responsible for giving feedback on the podcast and making sure it is the best it can possibly be. Students giving feedback should focus on the first three rows of the Presentation checklist, putting themselves in the roles of listeners and telling the presenting group whether their content is clear and engaging. Explain that in the next lesson, they will have a chance to revise their scripts in response to this feedback and prepare for a Tuning protocol based on how they present the content, focusing on the last four items of the Presentation checklist.

- Invite students to retrieve their podcast scripts and Presentation checklists, and instruct students to begin the Tuning protocol.

- Circulate to support students as they work to give feedback to one another. Emphasize that students are not to make revisions yet, as they will be doing this in the next lesson.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time B, before sharing their podcast script, students can highlight their sentences with language structures from the Language Dives from throughout the module.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time B, ensure each student has a copy of the podcast under review so they can follow along. Also, provide sentence frames for students to use in giving feedback. For example:

- This section/sentence/example is good because . . .

- In this section/sentence/example, can you try . . . because . . .

Closing and Assessment

A. Plan Revisions – W.7.5 (5 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can choose language that expresses ideas precisely and concisely, recognizing and eliminating wordiness and redundancy.”

- Ask students to remain in their podcast triads and work together to plan their revisions based on the Tuning protocol in this lesson. Remind students that as they make a plan for revision, they should consider the work they did in the previous lesson to express themselves precisely and concisely and to eliminate wordiness and redundancy. Inform students that they will have time to revise their podcast scripts for homework and in the next lesson before engaging in a second Tuning protocol with peers on their presentation skills.

- Invite students to reflect on the learning target and the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Research and Revise

- Students conduct any additional research necessary for completing their section of their podcast script. Then they revise and edit their section of the podcast script for clarity and style in preparation for the next lesson, in which they present their full scripts to another triad in a second Tuning protocol focused on presentation skills.

B. Practice Presentation

- Students practice presenting their part of the script, reading it aloud slowly, clearly, and with enunciation and emphasis.

For Lighter Support

- Before the end of class, allow time for students to partner with classmates who need heavier support to review their section of the podcast script, making recommendations on pronunciation and emphasis, so that their classmates can practice their presentations properly and with confidence for homework. Modeling for others gives students confidence for their own presentations.

For Heavier Support

- Before the end of class, allow time for students to partner with classmates who need lighter support to review their section of the podcast script, to ensure they know how to pronounce and emphasize the words in their section of the script. Doing so prepares students to properly and confidently practice their presentations for homework.
