Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 9

SL.7.4

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, meet with your triad partners and discuss the revisions you made on your podcast scripts from the previous lesson’s homework. As you discuss, use the following prompts to guide your thinking about how best to revise your scripts to prepare for a presentation. Write notes from your discussion beneath the prompts below.

1.  What does your group think are the most important aspects to consider when giving a spoken presentation?

Use the following words to write reasons people might make podcasts. You may need to add additional words like **and** or **with**.

verbs: speak, use, organize

adverbs: loudly, clearly, slowly

nouns: feeling, information

Responses will vary, but may include: We want to make sure our audience can follow what we’re saying and stay interested. So we want to make our presentation engaging and clear.

2.  How do you plan on revising your podcast script to incorporate these important aspects of spoken presentation?

I plan to revise my podcast script by changing the order in which we present events because this will help the listeners better understand the information. Also, I plan to add more dialogue and descriptions because this will help us describe different subject matter and alter the way we speak to add interest.
