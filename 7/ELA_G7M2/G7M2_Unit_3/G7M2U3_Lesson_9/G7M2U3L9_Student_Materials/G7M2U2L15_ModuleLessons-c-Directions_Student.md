Directions for Tuning Protocol

W.7.5, SL.7.1

**Name:** **Date:**

1.  Each student takes a turn sharing writing with a partner or group.

2.  The partner or group asks the writer clarifying questions if there’s something they don’t understand. Clarifying questions are matter of fact and answerable with a “yes,” a “no,” or a single brief sentence.

3.  Partner or group text codes, annotates, or takes notes on their notices and wonders, stars and steps.

4.  Partner or group identifies one star (one thing the writer did well) and records it on a sticky note.

5.  Partner or group identifies one step (one thing the writer could improve) and records it on a different-colored sticky note.

6.  Partner or group shares the feedback in a few Conversation Cycles:

- Cycle 1: strengths and the star noted

- Cycle 2: learning opportunities and the step noted

- Cycle 3: questions

7.  Response and clarification: writer shares out significant points, recognizes powerful feedback, and identifies next steps.

8.  The next writer in the pair or group takes turns.
