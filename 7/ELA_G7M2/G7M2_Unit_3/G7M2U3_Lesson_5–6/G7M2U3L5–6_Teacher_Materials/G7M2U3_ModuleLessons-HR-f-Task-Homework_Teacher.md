Homework: Compare “Disease Detective”  
and *Patient Zero*

RI.7.3

(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Reread pages 47–48 of *Patient Zero* and “Disease Detective” from the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment. Using evidence from both texts, explain how Dr. Richard Besser used the “mapping” and “shoe-leather method” that John Snow pioneered.

Just like John Snow, Besser used “mapping” and the “shoe-leather method” to solve the mystery of the *E. coli* epidemic. The article talks about how he “began asking questions,” about what the children had in common and what they ate. He “went door-to-door” in their towns to learn more about the cases. This was a good example of the shoe-leather method in which Snow also went “door to door” (48) in the area of the cholera epidemic to gather information. Besser also mapped where the patients lived, which was something Snow also pioneered to show the connection between “disease outbreaks and risk factors.” *Patient Zero* says that Snow’s map is “still studied” (47) by epidemiology students. He really does seem to be the “father of epidemiology” (48)!
