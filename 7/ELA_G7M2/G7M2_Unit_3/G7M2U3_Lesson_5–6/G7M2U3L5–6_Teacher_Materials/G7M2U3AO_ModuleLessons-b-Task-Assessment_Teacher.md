Mid-Unit 3 Assessment: Research to Answer a Question

(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Part I**

**Directions:** Read the article “Disease Detective,” in the Student Workbook. Then answer the questions below.

1.  What is the meaning of **strain** as it is used in the following sentence? (L.7.4a)

“Nasty bacteria called *E. coli* had attacked their bodies. Scientists knew this **strain** of *E. coli* could live in food and liquids. People who ate food with *E. coli* in it could get very sick.”

2.  cure

3.  difficulty

4.  movement

5.  <u>type</u>

6.  How does the idea that “*E. coli* could live in food and liquids” influence Besser’s actions? (RI.7.3)

7.  It makes him question whether the children had *E. coli*.

8.  <u>It causes him to collect information about what people ate.</u>

9.  It encourages him to change his idea about how *E. coli* spread.

10. It influences him to take more samples from the people who were infected.

11. How does scientists’ understanding of DNA allow them to “rule out a suspect”? (RI.7.3)

12. The DNA proves the bacteria can live inside of animals.

13. The DNA shows what kind of food the patients were eating.

14. <u>The DNA gives information about whether a bacteria is dangerous.</u>

15. The DNA provides clues about who is responsible for spreading the bacteria.

16. This question has two parts. First answer Part A, then answer Part B.

**Part A**

What discoveries did Besser make at the cider press that helped him solve this case?  
(Select <u>two</u>.) (RI.7.3)

17. All of the people who drank cider were now sick.

18. <u>The apples used to make the cider were not washed.</u>

19. Some strains of *E. coli* are not harmful in cider.

20. The apples in the cider were not available to test.

21. <u>The apples in the cider had been picked up off the ground.</u>

**Part B**

What idea did Besser have that helped him solve the case? (RI.7.3)

1.  DNA can help identify bacteria.

<!-- -->

22. Certain strains of bacteria are not dangerous.

23. <u>*E. coli* could spread through droppings and food.</u>

24. Bacteria are not the only things that make people sick.

25. Write a brief description of the actions Besser took to solve the mystery of the epidemic. (RI.7.1, RI.7.3)

To solve the mystery of the *E. coli* epidemic, Besser had to first identify the exact bacteria that was causing the outbreak. The idea that DNA can help identify the dangerous types of bacteria helped him and the other scientists do this. Once he saw that the patients had been infected by the same strain of bacteria, he knew their cases were related. Then, he had to figure out where the disease came from in the first place. Luckily, he knew that  
*E. coli* was a “food-borne illness.” He also knew that it could be spread by animal droppings. This helped him when he collected information about what the sick children had eaten and went to investigate the cider mill.

There, he saw that the apples came from the same ground where there were deer droppings. He also discovered that the people at the mill did not wash the apples or pasteurize the cider. Big mistake! The disease spread from the droppings to the apples and into the cider. This is why the children who drank the cider got sick. Mystery solved!

**  
Part II**

**Directions:** Research to answer the following questions by completing Parts A and B below. You may use the article “Disease Detective” in addition to at least one more article you find online to answer these research questions.

**Research question:** How do epidemiologists determine the cause of an epidemic?

**Part A**

What are some internet search terms you can use for these questions? (W.7.8):

Answers will vary, but may include: epidemiologist find source of epidemic; epidemiologist solve epidemic.

**Part B**

26. In the table, design a note-catcher to capture research notes. (W.7.7, W.7.8)

Be sure to include space to quote or paraphrase the evidence to answer the question, to cite the source, to explain why you think the source is credible, and to record questions raised by reading the text.

Sample student note-catcher and responses based on the provided text:

27. Use the information you gathered to write a paragraph to answer the research question: how do epidemiologists determine the cause of an epidemic?

Epidemiologists use many methods to determine the cause of an epidemic. First they look at patients’ symptoms, and then they perform laboratory tests to examine samples under a microscope. They may even “use DNA to identify a bacteria’s strain” (Tousignant).  
Once epidemiologists have identified the bacteria or virus affecting the patients, they try to figure out the original source. If the bacteria or virus is food-borne, then an epidemiologist might go to where the food was grown or processed to see how it was contaminated. If the bacteria or virus is transmitted through air or fluids, epidemiologists might study patients’ “past medical history” and “review medical records” to find the source of the illness. One thing is certain: epidemiologists work hard, conducting research and tests to determine the cause of an epidemic.
