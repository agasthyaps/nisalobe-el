Language Dive Guide: “Disease Detective,” Paragraph 10

RI.7.3, L.7.1a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

**Like police,** today’s disease detectives also might look for “fingerprints.” (from paragraph 10 of “Disease Detective” by Marylou Tousignant)

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target **(I can analyze how individuals, ideas, and events influence one another.)** and RI.7.3 by inviting students to discuss how epidemiologists and police influence one another in the way they gather information. Supporting Standard: L.7.1a

- Guiding Question: The sentence helps students respond to the guiding question **(What methods and tools help people to solve epidemics?)** by inviting them to discuss how epidemiologists use ideas from other fields to inform the study of epidemics.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses the adverbial phrase **like police** with the purpose of comparing the way epidemiologists and police gather information. Invite students to discuss each chunk briefly, but encourage extended conversation and practice with the focus structure: **Like police,**.

- Practice and Transfer: After discussing the focus structure, students practice using it to discuss something in their lives. Students transfer their understanding of the meaning and structure of this sentence when responding to the third selected response question, as well as when writing their short response in this lesson, which is the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment.

- Delivery: Invite students to compare this sentence with the Unit 2, Lessons 6–7 Language Dive sentence, which also includes a prepositional phrase starting with the word **like** in order to show comparison.

**Time**

10 minutes

Throughout the Language Dive

Refer to the instructions provided in the first three Language Dives of Module 1.

Deconstruct

- Invite students to put their finger by this sentence from “Disease Detective” on their note-catchers: **<u>Like police,</u> today’s disease detectives also might look for “fingerprints.”**

- Read aloud the sentence twice, and then ask students to take turns reading the sentence aloud with their partners.

- Ask:

“What does this sentence mean to you?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“How does this sentence add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

today’s disease detectives

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **today’s disease detectives**

- Say:

“This is the first chunk we are going to analyze. But is this where the sentence begins?” (No, this is in the middle of the sentence; we know because it doesn’t start with a capital letter or end with a period.)

“Why do you think we are starting with a middle chunk first?” (Responses will vary, but may include: because it helps our understanding or because it reduces distractions.)

“Who or what is this sentence about?” (today’s disease detectives)

- Cue students to expand the conversation by saying more:

“Can you say more about that?” (Responses will vary.)

- Invite students to take 30 seconds in pairs to discuss what they think a **disease detective** is in their own words. (Responses will vary, but may include that a detective is a police officer whose job it is to discover information about crimes. A **disease detective** also discovers information, but about diseases instead of crimes.)

- Ask:

“Can you figure out why the author added the word today’s?” (To emphasize that the disease detectives in this sentence are present-day detectives, distinct from detectives from the past. This sentence will tell us something about modern-day detectives that was likely not true about detectives from the past. Note that today’s is used here to refer to the present or modern time, rather than literally this day.)

- Invite students to discuss in pairs what they think this sentence will tell us about modern-day detectives that is distinct from detectives from the past.

also might look for “fingerprints.”

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **also might look for “fingerprints.”**

- Ask:

“What does this chunk tell us?” (What today’s disease detectives might do. They might look for “fingerprints.”)

“Why does the word fingerprints have quotation marks around it?” (The author uses quotation marks to signal she doesn’t literally mean fingerprints.)

- Invite students to discuss in pairs what they think the author literally means instead of actual fingerprints. Then, invite students to discuss why they think the author wrote **“fingerprints”** instead of what she literally meant. Students can read ahead in the paragraph to support their response. (Responses will vary, but may include that the author literally meant DNA, which also has a unique code like fingerprints; and that she wrote **“fingerprints”** to compare disease detectives to criminal detectives, who look for actual fingerprints to make a discovery.)

- If productive, cue students to clarify the conversation by confirming what they mean:

“So, do you mean \_\_\_\_\_?” (Responses will vary.)

- Ask:

“How is this different from what detectives from the past might have done?” (Detectives from the past might not have had the advanced technology to look at DNA.)

“What does the word also tell us?” (Also can mean in addition to or likewise. In this sentence, also is used to signal that, similar to disease detectives, there are others who might look for “fingerprints,” too.)

- Invite students to discuss in pairs who else might look for “fingerprints,” and whether they might literally look for fingerprints or not.

Like police,

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Display and read aloud the following sentence chunk: **Like police,**

- Underline like in green, and invite students to do the same on their note-catchers. 

- Ask:

“What does the word like mean in this chunk?” (like is used in this chunk to compare one thing to another; to say something is similar to something else.)

- Remind students that considering synonyms (words that mean the same thing) can help them learn new words and structures.

- Ask:

“Can you think of other words or phrases that mean the same thing as like?” (similar to; in the same way as)

“What is the author comparing?” (police and today’s disease detectives; like police tells us police also might look for fingerprints.)

- Invite students to discuss in pairs how disease detectives are **like** or **similar to** police. (Responses will vary, but may include that they both look for “fingerprints,” as mentioned in the previous chunk.)

- If productive, cue students to expand the conversation by saying more:

“Can you say more about that?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Tell students they will now practice the focus structure:

“You’ve played with this chunk and figured out the meaning. Now let’s use the structure in the following sentences for our own speaking and writing.”

- Point out that the adverbial phrase starting with **like** can be used in the beginning, middle, or end of a sentence to make comparisons, and invite them to practice using it in each of these ways. Draw students’ attention to the three sentence frames on their note-catchers:

1.  Like \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, it only takes a few people to spread a behavior or idea.

    noun phrase

(adverbial phrase \[preposition **like** + noun phrase\]**,** + independent clause.)

2.  It only takes a few people to spread a behavior or idea, like \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

    noun phrase

(independent clause + adverbial phrase**,** \[preposition **like** + noun phrase\].)

3.  Evidence shows that, like \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, it only takes a few people to spread a

    noun phrase

    behavior or idea.

(dependent clause**,** + adverbial phrase \[preposition **like** + noun phrase\]**,** + independent clause.)

- Say:

“Use this frame to talk about how the spread of behaviors and ideas is similar to that of disease in your own words with your partners.”

Like police, today’s disease detectives also might look for “fingerprints.”

Reconstruct

- Point to and read aloud the entire sentence on display: **<u>Like police,</u> today’s disease detectives also might look for “fingerprints.”**

- Ask:

“Can we say this sentence in a different order?” (Today’s disease detectives also might look for “fingerprints,” like police.)

- Display the Language Dive sentence from Module 2, Unit 2, Lessons 6–7: **These examples suggest that it only takes a few people to spread a behavior or idea, just like a disease**.

- Ask:

“How is this Language Dive sentence similar to the Language Dive sentence in Unit 2, Lessons 6–7?” (Both Language Dive sentences include an adverbial phrase starting with the word like in order to show comparison.)

“How is this Language Dive sentence different from the Language Dive sentence in Unit 2, Lessons 6–7?” (Responses will vary, but may include that the Language Dive sentence in Unit 2 included the adverbial phrase at the end of the sentence, while this Language Dive sentence includes the adverbial phrase at the beginning.)

- If productive, cue students to clarify the conversation by confirming what they mean:

“So, do you mean \_\_\_\_\_?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does this sentence help us understand how individuals, ideas, and events influence one another?” (It compares the way one idea influences another—for example, how the way that epidemiologists gather information to determine the source of something \[DNA to determine the source of a disease\] is similar to the way police do \[fingerprints to determine the source of a crime\]).

- If productive, cue students to listen carefully and seek to understand:

“Who can tell us what your classmate said in your own words?” (Responses will vary.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- Ask:

“What other questions can we ask that will help us understand this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

**Like police, disease detectives also** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

predicate

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use this frame to talk about something else disease detectives do that is similar to police, in your own words with your partners.”
