Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.7.3 – Work Time A: Students complete Part I of their mid-unit assessment as they read and analyze an article for the interaction of individuals, events, and ideas.

- RI.7.3 – Work Time B: In a Language Dive, students explore a sentence from “Disease Detectives” to better understand how individuals, events, and ideas interact.

- W.7.7 – Work Time C: Students complete Part II of their mid-unit assessment as they gather information to answer a research question from multiple print and digital sources, using search terms effectively, assessing the credibility and accuracy of each source, and quoting or paraphrasing the information appropriately. (RI.7.1, RI.7.3, W.7.7, W.7.8)

- W.7.7 – Closing and Assessment A: Students track progress on their abilities to research to answer a question assessing their effectiveness at drawing on several sources to answer a question.

- W.7.8 – Closing and Assessment A: Students track progress on their abilities to research to answer a question assessing their effectiveness at quoting or paraphrasing information from sources.

- Two lessons have been allocated for this assessment to ensure sufficient time for students to analyze “Disease Detectives” and conduct research. If these are taught in two separate lessons rather than together as one block, revisit the learning targets and the task at the beginning of the second 45-minute lesson to remind students of the task and purpose.

- The Think-Pair-Share protocol is used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- In the article read in this lesson, Dr. Richard Besser demonstrates perseverance and initiative as he solves the mystery of the *E. coli* outbreak.

- Since students will use this article for homework after this assessment, it is provided in the Student Workbook and not in the assessment materials.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Allow those students who complete the mid-unit assessments early to research another question from the anchor chart with the purpose of sharing their knowledge with the class.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the first half of this unit, students researched in small groups and independently to gather relevant information for their performance tasks. Additionally, students returned to texts from previous units to analyze them for the interaction of individuals, events, and ideas. This lesson continues those routines in an assessment, wherein students conduct independent research and answer questions related to a new article related to epidemics.

Support All Students

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment.

- In Work Time A, students should be reading the text independently. However, if some or all students need more support, read several pages aloud and then release students to read independently, in pairs, or in small groups. ▲

- For some students, this assessment may require more than the time allotted. Provide time over multiple days if necessary. ▲

- Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this lesson that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually.

- To support ELLs, the assessment in this lesson consists of tasks students have practiced throughout the unit thus far. This gradual release supports students in independent achievement on this assessment.

- ELLs may find it challenging to read the article and conduct research independently, even with all the practice on similar tasks throughout the unit. Remind students that they have successfully completed similar activities in class, and encourage them to do their best. Help students be mindful of the amount of time they spend on each task.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, 7.I.B.6, 7.I.C.10, and 7.I.C.12.

Assessment Guidance

- All assessment materials (student prompt, answer key and sample student responses) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback on this assessment, use the answer key and sample student responses to help complete students’ Track Progress recording forms.

- In this assessment, students are tracking progress toward the following anchor standards:

- W.7: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: conduct short as well as more sustained research projects based on focused questions, demonstrating understanding of the subject under investigation.

- W.8: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: gather relevant information from multiple print and digital sources, assess the credibility and accuracy of each source, and integrate the information while avoiding plagiarism.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will be introduced to the prompt for the end-of-unit assessment and begin planning and drafting their podcast scripts for their performance tasks.

- Students’ Mid-Unit 3 Assessments will be returned in Lesson 10 with feedback.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Return students’ **End of Unit 2 Assessments with feedback**, and allow students time to review feedback and write their name on the board if they require support.

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lessons 5–6**. Students may choose whether to share their goals for this assessment with a partner.

- Repeated routine: follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Mid-Unit 3 Assessment: Research to Answer a Question, Part I (30 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze how individuals, ideas, and events influence one another.”

- Inform students that over the course of two lessons, they will complete a mid-unit assessment. In this lesson, they will complete the first part.

- Distribute **Mid-Unit 3 Assessment: Research to Answer a Question** and the article **“Disease Detective.”**

- Read aloud the directions for Part I of the assessment while students follow along. Answer clarifying questions.

- Tell students that for this part of the assessment, they will read a new article about epidemics and analyze how individuals, events, and ideas interact. Remind students of their work throughout the module in analyzing how individuals, events, and ideas interact.

- Before students begin the first part of this assessment, incorporate reflection on and awareness of the following academic mindsets: “This work has value for me.” “I can succeed at this.” and “My ability and competence grow with my effort.”

- Ask:

“What value does the task of a reading assessment have for you beyond this class? Why?” (Responses will vary, but may include: this task has a lot of value for me because I will have to take assessments in most of my high school and college classes.)

“What will help you succeed on this assessment?” (Responses will vary, but may include: using my strategies to answer selected-response questions and writing a paragraph with a topic sentence, at least two pieces of evidence, and a concluding statement will help me succeed on this task.)

- Direct students’ attention to the following materials:

- **Academic word wall** and **domain-specific word wall**

- **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart**

- **Strategies to Answer Selected Response Questions anchor chart**

- **Online or print dictionaries**

- Remind students to refer to these materials as they read the assessment text and answer the assessment questions.

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence. Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart** and review perseverance, taking initiative, and taking responsibility. Remind students that because they will be reading and answering questions independently for the assessment, they will need to practice these habits.

- Invite students to begin the assessment.

- While they are taking the assessment, circulate to monitor and document their test-taking skills.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- Before the mid-unit assessment in Work Times A and C, challenge students to underline key vocabulary in the assessment directions as you read them aloud together as a class. Also, invite students to restate or clarify information for students who need heavier support. These supports ensure that students understand each task included in the assessment.

- As students read the article, encourage them to highlight key individuals, events, and ideas. Also, challenge them to record the gist of each paragraph. Doing so will increase their comprehension.

For Heavier Support

- Before the mid-unit assessment in Work Times A and C, read the directions for the assessment aloud slowly, twice, and also post them. This ensures that ELLs who may not be able to easily follow the language of the directions have multiple opportunities to access them.

- Display a “map” of the assessment to reference while explaining directions to the mid-unit assessment. This will reduce ambiguity and give students a clearer picture of what they can expect so that they can better allocate their time and attentional resources. Provide students with colored pencils or highlighters so that they can mark up the “map” as needed. Example:

Part I:

- Read the article.

- Answer the selected response questions based on the article.

- Write a paragraph about what Besser did to investigate the disease. Remember that a paragraph includes

1.  a topic sentence that answers the question;

2.  several pieces of evidence or examples from the article; and

3.  a concluding sentence that summarizes your response.

Part II:

- Record search terms you can use to answer the research question.

- Create a note-catcher to record research information.

- Use your search terms to find one good article to answer the research question.

- Record information from the new article and the article on the assessment in the note-catcher to answer the research question.

- Use the information from your note-catcher to write a paragraph to answer the constructed response question. Remember that a paragraph includes

4.  a topic sentence that answers the question;

5.  several pieces of evidence or examples from the article; and

6.  a concluding sentence that summarizes your response.

- As students read the article, encourage them to highlight key individuals, events, and ideas. Also, challenge them to record the gist of each paragraph. Doing so will increase their comprehension.

Work Time

B. Language Dive: “Disease Detective,” Paragraph 10 – RI.7.3, L.7.1a (10 minutes)

- Repeated routine: follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to facilitate a Language Dive with the following reflection sentence from the text model essay:

- “Like police, today’s disease detectives also might look for ‘fingerprints.’”

- Use the accompanying materials to facilitate the Language Dive:

- **Language Dive Guide: “Disease Detective,” Paragraph 10 (for teacher reference)**

- **Language Dive: “Disease Detective,” Paragraph 10 note-catcher**

- **Language Dive: “Disease Detective,” Paragraph 10 sentence strip chunks**

For Lighter Support

- During the Language Dive of Work Time B, students analyze the use of an adverbial phrase. Invite ELLs to remind the class of what an adverb is (describes or modifies a verb, adjective, or adverb, telling how or when), and give examples of adverbs and adverbial phrases (quickly, slowly, in the morning, like our friends). Remind students that they have worked with an adverbial phrase that makes a comparison using the word like in the Language Dive of Unit 2, Lessons 6–7. Teaching others helps students confirm their knowledge of language structures.

For Heavier Support

- During the Language Dive of Work Time B, some students may need additional support as they complete the sentence frame in the Practice section **(Like police, disease detectives also \_\_\_\_\_.)**. Provide a bank of options from which students can select answers to complete the frame. These may include: *must hunt for clues, use the shoe-leather method, go door to door, gather information, talk to many different people, look for “fingerprints.”*

Work Time

C. Mid-Unit 3 Assessment: Research to Answer a Question, Part II (30 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can use sources to answer a research question.”

- Before students begin the second part of this assessment, incorporate reflection on and awareness of the following academic mindsets: “This work has value for me.” “I can succeed at this.” and “My ability and competence grow with my effort.”

- Ask:

“What value does the task of researching have for you beyond this class? Why?” (Responses will vary, but may include: this task has a lot of value for me because I will have to research in most of my high school and college classes.)

“What will help you succeed on this assessment?” (Responses will vary, but may include: using the research skills I learned in class and trying hard will help me succeed on this task.)

- Transition students to Part II of the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment: Research to Answer a Question. Read aloud the directions for this part of the assessment as students follow along. Answer clarifying questions. Also, focus students on the **Researchers Do These Things anchor chart** and **Researcher’s Toolbox** to guide them when researching.

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence.

- Invite students to begin the assessment.

- While they are taking the assessment, circulate to monitor and document their test-taking skills.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- Before the mid-unit assessment in Work Times A and C, challenge students to underline key vocabulary in the assessment directions as you read them aloud together as a class. Also, invite students to restate or clarify information for students who need heavier support. These supports ensure that students understand each task included in the assessment.

For Heavier Support

- Before the mid-unit assessment in Work Times A and C, read the directions for the assessment aloud slowly, twice, and also post them. This ensures that ELLs who may not be able to easily follow the language of the directions have multiple opportunities to access them.

Closing and Assessment

A. Track Progress: Research – W.7.7, W.7.8 (15 minutes)

- Give students specific positive feedback on their completion of the Mid-Unit 3 Assessments (e.g., “I noticed a lot of you were quoting the web pages and citing your sources.”).

- Focus students on the Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart. Remind students that they will take responsibility for their own learning as they track their progress.

- Distribute **Track Progress: Research**. Remind students that successful learners keep track of and reflect on their own learning. Remind them that they have done this after every assessment.

- Distribute **sticky notes** so students can mark up their work with evidence. Tell students the sticky notes are for them to find evidence in their assessment work of the following criteria:

- W.7.7

- W.7.8

- Guide students through completing the form.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character and academic mindset focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What helped you to be successful at that assessment task? How much effort did you put in on the task? How did your effort affect your learning?” (Responses will vary, but may include: Using the research skills I learned in class and trying hard helped me to successfully complete it and confirm my understanding of how to research to answer a question.)

- Before students leave class, ensure they have their copy of the article “Disease Detective” for the homework activity.

Homework

A. Compare “Disease Detective” and *Patient Zero*

- Students reread pages 47–48 in ***Patient Zero*** and the “Disease Detective” article from the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment. Then they complete **Homework: Compare “Disease Detective” and *Patient Zero*** to compare epidemiologist Richard Besser’s methods to those of John Snow.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.

For Lighter Support

- Before the end of class, encourage students to work with a partner to review the homework questions and orally rehearse their answers. Doing so will ensure their comprehension and achievement.

For Heavier Support

- Before the end of class, review the homework questions and model finding answers in the two texts: “Disease Detective” and *Patient Zero*. Doing so will ensure students’ comprehension and achievement.
