Disease Detective

**Name:** **Date:**

By Marylou Tousignant

Six children were in hospitals near death. What was making them so ill? It was up to Dr. Richard Besser to solve the mystery—before more people got sick.

Besser had just started a new job with the federal agency that protects the nation's health when he got the urgent call: Six children hospitalized in Massachusetts. Their kidneys had begun to fail. They could die.

That news was bad enough. Then Besser got worse news. Lab tests showed what was making them sick. Nasty bacteria called *E. coli* had attacked their bodies. Scientists knew this strain of *E. coli* could live in food and liquids. People who ate or drank something with *E. coli* in it could get very sick.

Besser wondered: Did that happen here? He had to find out. "I wanted to know how to stop it," he said. And quickly! People's lives might depend on what he found out.

Every year, about 48 million people in the United States get sick from food-borne illnesses. Most cases are mild. Not always. About 3,000 people die each year from eating contaminated food. Besser didn't want that to happen here. He jumped on a plane for Massachusetts.

On the Case

Besser knew exactly what to do. Why? Because he is an epidemiologist. That's a scientist who studies epidemics, or outbreaks of fast-spreading diseases. These scientists also find ways to prevent outbreaks. Besser worked for the U.S. government at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at its headquarters in Georgia.

Disease detectives such as Besser are like police on a crime case. They hunt for clues, or pieces of the puzzle. First, they must figure out what's causing the disease. Is it bad bacteria like *E. coli*? Maybe it's a virus. Some viruses can taint food. Others cause illnesses such as measles or swine flu.

Puzzle Pieces

The first clue is a patient's symptoms, or signs of the disease. Different diseases have different symptoms. Swine flu can involve a high fever, body aches, chills, and fatigue (see "A New Flu," below). A food-borne illness like *E. coli* can cause severe stomach pains, diarrhea, and fever.

Lab tests often provide important clues, too. Doctors might take samples of body fluids such as saliva. They examine these samples under a microscope. They look for tiny "bugs" such as disease-causing bacteria. When people get sick from food, three kinds of bacteria are among the most common culprits: *salmonella*, *campylobacter*, and, yes, *E. coli*.

Suspect Fingerprints

Like police, today's disease detectives also might look for "fingerprints." These aren't the kind left behind by a criminal's sticky fingers. They're DNA fingerprints. DNA is a tiny molecule inside an organism. It holds a unique code. This code controls how that organism will grow and look.

Disease detectives sometimes use DNA to identify a bacteria's strain. That data can help nail the suspect. How? Take the case of *E. coli*. Some strains aren't dangerous at all. So testing a bacteria's DNA could rule it out as a suspect. But what if a DNA test shows that everyone who is sick has the exact same dangerous strain of *E. coli*? That's a great clue. It could prove the cases are linked.

Identifying the Source

Besser's first clue came in that urgent phone call. Lab tests already had shown why these children were sick. He knew it was a bad strain of *E. coli*. Now he had to figure out where it came from. How had the patients come into contact with it?

*E. coli* typically live in the intestines of animals such as cows, sheep, or deer. The animals don't get sick. They can spread the bacteria through their droppings, though. Tiny bits of bacteria can wind up in the meat, milk, fruits, and vegetables people eat.

People also can spread *E. coli* even if they don't get sick themselves. It can spread if they don't wash their hands after using the bathroom or before preparing food.

Asking Questions

Besser began asking questions. What did the sick children have in common? What places had they visited? What did they eat?

He went to nearby doctors' offices and hospitals. He looked for other cases with the same symptoms. He found out where the sick children lived. He went door-to-door in their towns. He asked even more questions.

Besser found 23 cases in all. During a one-month period, all the patients, who ranged in age from 2 to 70, had gotten sick from *E. coli*. Besser mapped where the patients lived. He made a list of what the sick people ate. He made another list of foods eaten by people who had not gotten sick. He could compare the two lists. That could rule out a lot of foods. He was getting closer to the answer!

Common Culprits

All 23 patients had three foods in common: American cheese slices, fish sticks, and fresh apple cider. The *E. coli* must have been in one of those foods. Which one?

Besser had an idea. He studied the list of foods eaten by the people who had not gotten sick. The cheese and fish sticks were on that list. *Bingo!* Besser now suspected the apple cider. Would he be the first to prove *E. coli* could spread through fresh cider?

He followed his hunch. He went to the cider mill where the apple cider had been made. He found that most apples used in the cider were "drops." That means they'd fallen off the trees. Workers had scooped them up from the ground.

Cider Clues

Besser found something else on the ground: deer droppings. He knew that *E. coli* could spread through droppings like these.

At the cider mill, Besser found more clues. He found out that the apples weren't washed before they were crushed to make cider. He also learned the cider was not pasteurized. During pasteurization, liquids are heated to very high temperatures. This kills most bacteria that cause disease. Besser now had three strong clues!

The investigation had taken two months. By then, there was no more fresh cider for Besser to test for *E. coli*. He could only find old, frozen deer droppings. The *E. coli* had not survived there. Had Besser reached a dead end? No.

Mystery Solved

Besser's clues were strong enough to link the *E. coli* outbreak to fresh apple cider. It seemed nothing else could have made these patients sick. He had solved the case!

It wasn't over, though. Besser still had to figure out how to stop this from happening again. He said cider makers should wash the apples. They also could pasteurize the cider.

Besser's findings about the *E. coli* outbreak in Massachusetts in 1991 helped change the way most cider is made today. (Not all cider is pasteurized, though.)

Besser's *E. coli* case had a happy ending. Everyone got better. What he learned now protects other people from getting sick. "To solve this mystery, the feeling was incredible!" Besser said. Case closed.

A New Flu

Bacteria aren't the only "bugs" that make people sick. So do viruses. A virus is about one one-thousandth the size of bacteria. It can't live on its own. So it invades the cells of people, animals, and plants. There, the virus makes lots of copies of itself.

Some viruses cause food-borne illnesses. Most cause infections like colds. These viruses are contagious. They spread easily. When an infected person sneezes or coughs, thousands of bits of virus fly through the air. They find new cells to invade. That's how they can infect another person.

Fighting Back

Disease detectives are always on the lookout for new viruses and ways to fight them.

They raced to Mexico when a novel virus erupted there in 2009. A combination of pig, bird, and human flu genes, it became known as swine flu. Cases soon popped up in the United States and around the world, in what is known as a pandemic.

More recently, disease researchers have focused on the virus that causes COVID-19, which affects the lungs. The virus emerged from China in late 2019 and quickly became a global pandemic, killing more than 7 million people in 5 ½ years.

Along the way, the virus spun off thousands of variants, though not all are currently active or harmful.

Because viruses are always changing, it’s difficult to keep them from spreading. But there is one way: vaccines.

Did you get a flu shot?

That shot was a vaccine. Flu vaccines are made from dead or weakened forms of viruses. They get your body to make antibodies, weapons that help fight off infection if you do get exposed to the flu. Flu shots can change from year to year in response to which strains of the virus are most widespread.

There are also vaccines for the COVID-19 virus. They are made in a different way, but with the same intent: to help produce antibodies to fight infection. Developing a new vaccine is one of the most effective ways that disease detectives can stop the spread of a virus.
