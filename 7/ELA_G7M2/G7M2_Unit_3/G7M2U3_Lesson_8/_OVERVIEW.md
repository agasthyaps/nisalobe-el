# Lesson 8: Create a Podcast: Draft a Podcast Script
**Grade 7: Module 2: Unit 3: Lesson 8**

**Summary:** Students work in their triads to combine their three narrative leads into one lead, revising to eliminate wordiness or redundancy. Then each member of the triads independently writes one of the three remaining sections of their podcast script.

**Focus Standards:** W.7.2, W.7.5, L.7.3a, L.7.4

**Learning Targets:**
- I can work with my peers to strengthen the narrative lead of my podcast script. (W.7.5)
- I can choose language that expresses ideas precisely and concisely, recognizing and eliminating wordiness and redundancy. (L.7.3a)
- I can write one section of a podcast script to convey ideas and information from my research. (W.7.2)

**Agenda:** Opening → Engage the Learner – L.7.4 (5 minutes) → Work Time → Combine Narrative Leads – W.7.5 (15 minutes) → Closing and Assessment → Draft a Podcast Script – W.7.2 (25 minutes)
