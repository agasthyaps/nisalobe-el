5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

W.7.3, L.7.1a, L.7.5c

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

“But why?” probed Divya, **a tremble beginning in her voice**. (from page 1 of Model Podcast Script: “Story of the Epidemic of 1994” by EL Education)

**Lesson 7 Placement**

Lead this Mini after students have analyzed the model narrative lead in a podcast in Work Time A.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target (I can write the narrative lead of a podcast script using effective techniques and relevant descriptive details.) and W.7.3 by presenting an example of descriptive detail within the narrative lead of a podcast script. The sentence also helps students to address L.7.1a by providing an opportunity to explain the function of phrases and L.7.5c by providing an opportunity to distinguish among the connotations of a words with similar definitions (**probed** vs. **asked**). Supporting standard: L.7.4d

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses an adverbial phrase with the purpose of describing the sound of a speaker’s voice.

- Transfer: noun + **-ing** participle + noun used to add descriptive details when writing the narrative lead of a podcast for the End of Unit 3 Assessment.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **“But why?” probed Divya,** **<u>a tremble beginning in her voice.</u>**

- Ask:

“What kind of information is in this sentence?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses. Look for students to notice that the sentence contains a quote, an attribution that identifies the speaker, and descriptive details that describe the sound of the speaker’s voice.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **a tremble beginning in her voice.**

- Ask:

“What is another way to say ‘tremble’?” (shake, move, shiver)

“Can you show me with your body how it looks to tremble?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to shake and shiver.)

“Can you figure out what part of speech the phrase a tremble is in this chunk? How do you know?” (It’s a noun. We know this because it has the article a in front of it.)

“Can you make a sound to demonstrate what ‘a tremble beginning in her voice’ might sound like?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to produce a vocal sound with vibrato or shakiness.)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **“But why?” probed Divya,** **<u>a tremble beginning in her voice.</u>**

- Ask:

“Why do you think the writer used the verb probed instead of asked?” (Because the connotation of probed gives the reader specific information about Divya’s question and how she asked it. It tells us she was seeking a deeper understanding.)

- As needed, encourage students to verify the meaning of this word using a dictionary.

- Ask:

“What do you think the function of the phrase ‘a tremble beginning in her voice’ is in this sentence? Is it a noun, adjective, or adverb phrase? How do you know?” (It is a noun phrase because it starts with a noun, but it is functioning as an adverbial phrase that describes the main action in the sentence—“probed.”)

- Underline a tremble beginning in her voice in green, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 

- Ask:

“What does this adverbial phrase tell us about how Divya might have been feeling about what she was asking?” (that she was upset, uncertain, apprehensive, or even frightened of the response she might get)

- Display a list of adverbial phrases with similar meanings that students can use to replace  
  “a tremble beginning in her voice”:

> **without certainty**
>
> **apprehensively**
>
> **fearfully**

- Ask:

“How does this sentence change if we replace this adverbial phrase with a simpler one that has a similar meaning? I’ll give you 30 seconds to discuss with your partner.”

- Ask:

“Why do you think the writer used ‘a tremble beginning in her voice’ rather than one of these shorter alternatives?” (to add descriptive detail that helps the reader or listener imagine what Diyva sounded like)

“How can you use adverbial phrases that start with nouns to add descriptive detail in the narrative lead of your own podcast script?” (Responses will vary.)

- Ask:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target:  
‘I can write the narrative lead of a podcast script using effective techniques and relevant descriptive details’?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame and selected response options:

**“I won’t go into quarantine!,” shouted Mary Mallon, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

adverbial phrase

(noun + **-ing** participle + noun = adverbial phrase)

**panic showing in her eyes**

**hands waving in the air**

**a scream escaping her body**

- Say:

“Discuss with your partner how each of these adverbial phrases can be used to add descriptive detail to the sentence. What images does each one evoke in the reader’s or listener’s mind? What do you imagine when you read each one?”

- Note: To increase the level of challenge, invite students to produce their own adverbial phrases to complete the sentence. Consider extending this practice by giving students time to write a sentence that follows the same structure (dialogue + speaker attribution + adverbial phrase) for the narrative lead of their own podcast scripts.

- Responses will vary, but may include:

**“I won’t go into quarantine!,” shouted Mary Mallon, <u>panic showing in her eyes.</u>**

adverbial phrase

(noun + **-ing** participle + noun = adverbial phrase)
