**Story of the Epidemic of 1994**

The megaphone blasted, “Don’t leave your homes. Stay put. It is important to stay calm.” But it wasn’t calm in the streets. It wasn’t calm in the homes. It wasn’t calm in the hospitals or in the pharmacies. It was hard to find calm anywhere in Surat, India. But it was easy to find panic.

As the pneumonic plague spread its fingers across Surat, people reacted in fear and confusion. They elbowed their way through turnstiles to hop on trains. They shoved each other to get on buses. Pharmacists gathered their antibiotics and fled with their families. The city was deserted and locked up. It struggled to deal with the sick and dying.

Prakash Mehta, a business executive, studied the empty streets around him and wept. “They’re trying to go by whatever way they can,” he said. “By train, by car, bus, truck, anything.” The businesses’ doors were shuttered and locked. Officials in hospitals prepared quarantine zones. Doctor Parvez Sheikh, working in a hospital, said, “Patients come walking in and within minutes, they collapse and die.” Across the city, officials closed schools, restaurants, parks, factories, and businesses. Everyone stayed inside. The rare few who were on the streets reached for medical masks or bits of cloth to protect from the spread of disease. You could hear a pin drop on the streets.

Until suddenly the silence was broken with a loud crackling.

“Srrrchhhh,” the caution tape squeaked, as it stretched around the slum in Surat. “Why are you taping us in?” asked Divya, a young child. “We are keeping you safe,” responded the police officer. “It’s for your own good. Please go home and stay inside.”

“But why?” probed Divya, a tremble beginning in her voice. “Go home,” responded the police officer, his voice firm.

The police continued to cordon off the slum. This is where they believed patient zero for the epidemic lived.

**Scientific and Social Effects of the Plague**

**Scientific Effects**

Let’s rewind to the beginning. How did this epidemic start? It might have been the earthquake that hit Surat months before. People fled their houses, leaving behind food that attracted rats that carried the plague. Or it could be that same earthquake might have caused forest-dwelling rats infected with the plague to migrate to nearby villages. Or, it could be that heavy monsoon rains caused flooding that resulted in poor sanitary conditions. Water from the rains carried garbage, drowned cows and oxen, as well as dogs and cats. Any of these conditions might have brought more rats. And the rats bring the fleas. And with the fleas can come the plague. According to the CDC: “Most human plague is the bubonic form, which results from the bites of infected fleas.” “However,” they write, “plague also can be transmitted to humans by handling infected animals or by inhaling infectious aerosols from persons with pneumonic plague.” The outbreak in Surat included both the bubonic and pneumonic forms of Yersinia pestis, the official name for the disease.

**Social Effects**

That was the medical cause. The effects on society were intense. People fled in mass hysteria. Antibiotics disappeared from pharmacists due to “panic buying.” Rumors spread about quarantines. 400,000 to 600,000 people fled the city within four days of the announcement of the epidemic. This included those who were already infected. Even doctors and pharmacists panicked, seizing medication and hustling their families out of the city. Panic spread beyond Surat, to New Delhi and Mumbai. Eventually, the panic spread worldwide. The plague outbreak took an economic toll. It occurred just before Diwali, the Festival of Lights in India, and caused a loss of \$260 million in Surat alone.

Confusion, devastation, and panic were the hallmark of 1994’s plague outbreak in India. After this mess of an outbreak, India vowed to improve. In 2002 it would have its chance.

**Tools, Mindset, and Character**

A new plague outbreak occurred in 2002. Sixteen cases and four deaths were reported in the village of Hat Koti. This time, scientists raced to find a solution. The Indian government officials, scientists, and healthcare workers arrived quickly to the village. They had a plan. And their campaign stopped the plague in its tracks.

First, the government officials sent scientists to the source. The scientists used the shoe-leather method to locate patient zero. The shoe-leather method means they went door to door and talked to people. This gave them better information than just looking at reports or newspapers. To control the spread of the disease, health workers gave antibiotics to people infected with plague and to people who came in contact with them. Additionally, the government fumigated the villages to kill lice, which also helped end the spread of the disease. Finally, the government conducted a public education campaign to inform people about the plague. They taught people how plague spreads, how it can be treated, and how it can be prevented. This last step curbed panic and avoided the chaos of the 1994 outbreak.

Through their response in 2002, the Indian government officials, scientists, and healthcare workers showed that they were effective learners. They took initiative, persevered, and used collaboration to solve a problem that just a few years before had overwhelmed them and their country. They also showed that they were ethical people by treating the victims in the village with compassion, empathy, and respect. They gave the villagers medicine and taught them about prevention instead of shunning and scaring them as they had done in the 1994 breakout. Finally, those involved helped contribute to a better world by educating the public and stopping the spread of panic. These positive actions helped to create a healthy, equitable community in the village and throughout all of India.

**Conclusion: Our Message**

Go to the source.

Don’t panic.

Arm yourself with research.

Educate the public to reduce fear.

The way that we approach an epidemic can save lives or create panic and more deaths. We all need to consider what we should do during a time of crisis and take steps to ensure we have the proper tools in place. Without a calm, measured approach, we will end up causing panic instead of finding a cure.
