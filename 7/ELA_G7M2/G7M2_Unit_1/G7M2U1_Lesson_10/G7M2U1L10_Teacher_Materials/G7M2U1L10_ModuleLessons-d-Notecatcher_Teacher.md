<p><strong>Patient Zero:</strong></p>
<p>The person who seemed to be infecting everyone was <strong>Mary Mallon. She cooked dessert for Warren family, who then became ill.</strong></p>
<p>She acted suspiciously when she <strong>left shortly after everyone got sick.</strong></p>
<p>She was frightened by <strong>Soper and reacted by grabbing a knife.</strong></p>
<p>(Habits of Character):</p>
<p>Patient Zero showed <strong>integrity with her work</strong> when she <strong>didn’t want to stop working after being confronted by Soper.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Investigators:</strong></p>
<p>One of the investigators was <strong>George Soper.</strong> To investigate the epidemic, he <strong>investigated the home and found no cause. He was told of Mary making dessert, and finally found and confronted Mary.</strong></p>
<p>(Habits of Character):</p>
<p>The first investigator showed <strong>perseverance and initiative</strong> when he <strong>persisted and dug more deeply even when the solution was not obvious.</strong></p></td>
