**“Typhoid in New York, 1906,” “A Shameful Disease,” and “Tracking the Suspect”**

- Mrs. Warren, at a summer resort in Long Island, went to praise her cook, Mary Mallon, for the dessert Mary made, Peach Melba.

- Mrs. Warren wanted to keep Mary as their cook, in the fall.

- A few days later, Margaret, Mrs. Warren’s daughter, got sick.

- She had a headache, stomach cramps, a violent cough, and fever.

- Soon, a maid, the gardener, Mrs. Warren’s second daughter, and Mrs. Warren were all sick.

- More than half the household (people in the house) became sick and were diagnosed with typhoid fever.

- This was unthinkable, because they were wealthy. Typhoid was not thought of as a disease of the rich and privileged.

- George Soper was hired to investigate.

- Soper suspected the cook, Mary, who quit suddenly when the household became sick.

- Soper acted like a detective.

- Soper found out that Mary had also left suddenly after other households developed typhoid fever.

- She was connected to twenty-two cases of typhoid and one death.

- He suspected she was an “asymptomatic carrier”: she infected others without getting sick herself.

- A German bacteriologist, Dr. Robert Koch, discovered the first healthy carrier of typhoid at a bakery in Germany.

- Mary Mallon might have been the first healthy carrier in America.

- Soper found her in New York in the spring, when someone in another household got sick with typhoid.

- He found her in the kitchen and asked for samples of her urine, feces, and blood.

- She thought he was crazy and chased him out of her kitchen with a knife.

**“The Doctor’s Plague”**

- In 1847, Ignac Semmelweis, a Hungarian doctor, suspected that doctors were passing an infection called puerperal fever from woman to woman in labor and delivery.

- He tried having doctors wash their hands in a water-bleach mixture before delivering babies.

- The rate of puerperal fever dropped to less than two percent.

- He was fired for his ideas.

- Twenty years later, Louis Pasteur provided scientific proof (evidence) that microscopic organisms cause disease.

- In the 1880s, a British surgeon named Joseph Lister demonstrated that sterilizing surgical instruments (washing medical tools) helped patients.

- Doctors improved their cleanliness.
