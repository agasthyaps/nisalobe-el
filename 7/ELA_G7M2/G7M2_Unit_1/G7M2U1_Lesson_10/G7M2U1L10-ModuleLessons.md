Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.7.4 – Opening A: In an entrance ticket, students practice using strategies to determine the impact of word choice on meaning and tone.

- RI.7.3 – Work Time B: Students identify individuals, ideas, and events in *Patient Zero*, pages 72–78, and analyze how they interact in the text.

- SL.7.1 – Closing and Assessment A: Students engage in a collaborative discussion about how the individuals, events, and ideas interact in this excerpt.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners by collaborating with peers in analyzing the interactions among elements of a text. They also focus on working to become ethical people by showing respect and compassion as they give feedback to their peer’s constructed response.

- The Think-Pair-Shareprotocol is used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- In the excerpt of *Patient Zero* read in this lesson, George Soper took initiative in noticing things that needed to be done and then doing them. He also persevered when he saw that the mystery of the typhoid outbreak wouldn’t be as easy to solve as he thought.

- Note there is a differentiated version of the Solve *Patient Zero*, Chapter 4 note-catcher used in Work Time B in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release more responsibility more quickly to students as they comprehend the tasks or concepts. For example:

- Allow those students who are identifying the gist and other elements quickly the opportunity to develop their own discussion questions about the chapter, related to the interactions among individuals, events, and ideas. Ask these students to share their questions with the group as a way of generating discussion. (RI.7.3)

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students continued their investigation of how the individuals, events, and ideas interact in the text, analyzing how our ideas about diseases are shaped by what happens during epidemics. In this lesson, students apply their skills to a story of a new epidemic.

Support All Students

- At this point, students should be reading the text independently. However, if some or all students need more support, read several pages aloud and then release students to read independently, in pairs, or in small groups. ▲

- The subject matter in this excerpt includes descriptions of death and disease. Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this chapter that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually.

- For the discussion in Closing and Assessment A, consider strategically grouping students into heterogeneous groups of four, containing a pair of students at one level and a pair of students at a different level. This will help students feel comfortable participating at their level but also challenge them to participate in heterogeneous groups as required at the end of unit discussion. Consider asking a group of students who are confident speakers to model a short discussion, and encourage all other students to note language and ideas they will use in their own discussions. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson continues the use of the same flowchart note-catcher in a new chapter and with a new epidemic, which students work in small groups to complete. The graphic and collaborative support helps ELLs succeed in abstract analysis of the interactions among individuals, events, and ideas in the text.

- ELLs may find may find it challenging to synthesize the information they read about a new epidemic into the categories of ideas, events, and individuals. Add to the anchor chart begun in Lesson 8 of this guide, and define each of these elements with sketches and examples from the new chapter of the text. Also, as noted in the teaching notes of Lesson 10, group students in more heterogeneous groups of four, containing a pair of students at one level and a pair of students at a different level, so that students will feel comfortable participating at their level but will also begin to be challenged to participate in heterogeneous groups as they will have to in the end of unit discussion.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, 7.I.B.6, 7.I.C.10, 7.I.C.12, and 7.II.C.6.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Solve *Patient Zero* Chapter 4 note-catchers to ensure students understand how the individuals, events, and ideas interact in this excerpt.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue their analysis of how individuals, events, and ideas interact in chapter 4.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.7.4 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 10**. Students will review their responses to the entrance ticket in Work Time B.

- Repeated routine: follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read *Patient Zero*, Pages 72–78 – RI.7.3 (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same process as with previous lessons for students to read pages 72–78 of ***Patient Zero***, using the **Text Guide: *Patient Zero*** **(for teacher reference)** as necessary. If students do not finish reading the excerpt within the allotted time, use the **Synopsis: *Patient Zero***, **Pages 72–78** document to review the key details from the excerpt. Then have students identify the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary, reflect on their reading as they choose, and record the overall gist on **sticky notes** using the following resources as appropriate: **vocabulary logs**, **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**, and **Questions about Epidemics anchor chart**.

- Gist: Mary Mallon was the first American Typhoid asymptomatic carrier.

- Once students have finished reading and reflecting on the excerpt, ask them to Think-Pair-Share:

“Which habit(s) of character did George Soper demonstrate in this excerpt?” (Responses will vary, but may include: George Soper took initiative in noticing things that needed to be done and then doing them. He also persevered when he saw that the mystery of the typhoid outbreak wouldn’t be as easy to solve as he thought.)

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time A, students may note the author’s use of dashes on pages 72–78. For further practice with dashes from the Language Dive in Lessons 6–7, assign students each a page and ask them to determine the purpose of each dash on that page. They can work independently (all the students with that page working individually) or collaboratively (all the students with that page working together). To guide students’ analysis, ask, “Why did the author use a dash here?” If necessary, follow up with questions such as, “Does the dash emphasize information or make a connection between information?”

- At the end of Work Time A, challenge students to prepare for the analysis work they will do in Work Time B by listing on their copies of Synopsis: *Patient Zero*, Pages 72–78 the key individuals (people), events, and ideas (beliefs about disease) that they read about in the chapter. They can share this list with their classmates who need heavier support.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time A, note the author’s use of dashes on pages 72–78. For further practice with dashes from the Language Dive in Lessons 6–7, assign groups of students each a page and ask them to determine the purpose of each dash on that page. To guide students’ analysis, ask, “Why did the author use a dash here? Does the dash emphasize information or make a connection between information?”

- At the end of Work Time A, support students to prepare for the analysis work they will do in Work Time B by working with their classmates who need lighter support to highlight on their copies of Synopsis: *Patient Zero*, Pages 72–78 the key individuals (people), events, and ideas (beliefs about disease) that they read about in the chapter.

Work Time

B. Analyze Interactions among Individuals, Events, and Ideas: *Patient Zero*, Pages 72–78 – RI.7.3 (15 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify key individuals, events, and ideas in a text.”

“I can analyze how individuals, ideas, and events interact with one another.”

- Inform students that for this lesson, they will continue analyzing *Patient Zero* for the interaction of Individuals, Events, and Ideas for a new chapter and a new outbreak. This time, students will work in small groups to fill out note-catchers for the excerpt of text they just read as well as generate discussion questions to be used during a whole-class discussion.

- Invite students to form groups of three or four. Distribute the **Solve *Patient Zero***, **Chapter 4 note-catcher** and the **Solve *Patient Zero***, **Chapter 4 note-catcher** ▲ as necessary. The differentiated note-catcher supports students in analyzing interactions among individuals, events, and ideas with sentence starters. ▲ Ask students to retrieve their **Mindsets and Habits of Character** handout for reference.

- Invite students to work together in small groups to fill out the note-catcher and use the information in it to generate follow-up questions for a class discussion, similar to the questions they’ve encountered in previous lessons.

- After about 10 minutes, check for understanding using the **Solve *Patient Zero***, **Chapter 4 note-catcher (pages 72–78) (for teacher reference)**.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time B, invite students to use the Solve *Patient Zero*, Chapter 4 note-catcher ▲, noting for students the similarities to the note-catcher they used to analyze chapter 2. The sentence starters in this resource support students in analyzing the interactions of individuals, events, and ideas.

Closing and Assessment

A. Discuss Individuals, Events, and Ideas: *Patient Zero*, Pages 72–78 – SL.7.1 (10 minutes)

- Focus students on the **Discussion Norms anchor chart**, and ask them to set a goal for themselves in this class discussion. Encourage students to consider using the new question and sentence frames to acknowledge new ideas expressed by others or to modify their own views. Remind students that answering questions and responding to their peers will be informally assessed on their end of unit assessment.

- Lead a class discussion on the following prompt: How do the events and key individuals in this excerpt interact to change our ideas about disease?

- Encourage students from each group to share their follow-up questions to help expand the conversation. As necessary, prompt a more detailed discussion by asking the following questions:

“How did the individuals’ ideas about who could get typhoid affect how they interacted with one another?” (The “privileged” people believed that they weren’t supposed to get typhoid, and this influenced the Thompsons’ landlord to hire an investigator right away to protect his reputation.)

“How did the idea of an ‘asymptomatic carrier’ (someone without symptoms), influence Soper?” (Because of the idea of an asymptomatic carrier, Soper knew he was probably looking for someone who did not show signs of being sick, but still carried the illness.)

“Which of Mary’s actions caused Soper to suspect her of being an asymptomatic carrier?” (Mary’s leaving the Thompsons’ house shortly after some of the family members got sick caused him to suspect Mary.)

“What habits of character or mindsets caused Soper to approach Mary the way he did?” (Soper was inquisitive and determined to solve the case of typhoid, but he did not consider how Mary would react as a human instead of a “walking collection of typhoid germs” (84). This meant that he confronted her too aggressively and without compassion.)

“What habits of character or mindsets caused Mary to react to Soper the way she did?” (Mary felt that she was a hard worker and belonged in her community. She also wanted to defend herself and so reacted negatively to the way Soper approached her.)

- After about 7 minutes of discussion, ask students to Turn and Talk to self-assess how they did on the discussion norms and the goal they set for themselves at the beginning of the discussion.

- Ensure students have **Homework: Analyze Interactions: *Patient Zero***, **Pages 72–78**. Inform students that they will answer these questions for homework in order to synthesize their understanding of how the individuals, events, and ideas interact in this excerpt. Remind students that answering questions such as these will be part of their end of unit assessment.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- Before releasing students to begin their small group discussions, post the follow-up questions and challenge students to create sentence starters to answer each one. Remind students to also create sentence starters to give evidence that supports their responses. They can share these sentence starters with their classmates who need heavier support. Creating sentence starters gives students confidence with language structures they can use in their discussions.

For Heavier Support

- Before releasing students to begin their small group discussions, post the follow-up questions and provide students with sentence starters to answer each one. (These may come from their classmates who need lighter support.) Allow time for students to complete the sentence starters in writing and orally rehearse their statements with a partner. Writing down and practicing sentences they can use in a discussion gives students confidence to increase their successful participation.

Homework

A. Respond to Questions

- In preparation for similar questions on the end of unit assessment, students complete Homework: Analyze Interactions: *Patient Zero*, Pages 72–78 to respond to selected and constructed response items to synthesize their understanding of how the individuals, events, and ideas interact in the excerpt.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread pages 79–83 of *Patient Zero* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.

For Lighter Support

- Allow time at the end of class for students to preview the homework questions, especially the constructed response prompt. Challenge students to work independently—or, if necessary, in pairs—to draft sentence starters for the topic and concluding sentences as well as sentence starters that introduce text evidence to support their response. Encourage students to share these sentence starters with their classmates who need heavier support. Drafting sentence starters for their classmates allows students to rehearse their own responses to the prompt.

- As in Lessons 8–9, consider whether students still need to work with the Synopsis: *Patient Zero*, Pages 79–83 or whether they are ready to be released into prereading the text without this support.

For Heavier Support

- Allow time at the end of class for students to preview the homework questions, especially the constructed response prompt, working with a partner to read it aloud and highlight and define key words. Then students can paraphrase the prompt to a classmate who needs lighter support to check their understanding. At this time, these classmates who need lighter support can share their sentence starters to be used in completing their response. Deconstructing and paraphrasing the prompt ensures students understand the assignment.

- As in Lessons 8–9, provide students with the Synopsis: *Patient Zero*, Pages 79–83, and ask them to highlight and illustrate it after they have completed their prereading.
