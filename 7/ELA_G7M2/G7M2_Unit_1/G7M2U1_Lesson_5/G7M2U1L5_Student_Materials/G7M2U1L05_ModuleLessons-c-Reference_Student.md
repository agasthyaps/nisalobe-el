**“The Soho Cholera Outbreak, 1854,” “Nothing to Fret About,” and “The Angel of Death Visits”**

- Sarah Lewis woke up to find her baby was sick with a fever and diarrhea.

- She told her husband, Thomas, to fetch the doctor.

- Dr. Rogers came and told Sarah not to worry, that it was just summer diarrhea.

- He gave some suggestions. He commented on the terrible smell in the streets.

- Sarah showed him the cesspool (garbage and sewage pile) right under the family’s window.

- The family also had a water pump beside them (called the Broad Street Pump), next to the cesspool.

- Baby Frances’ diarrhea got worse. She got weak. She turned a bluish color.

- There was sickness and death throughout the neighborhood.

- Thomas suggested going to stay with family in the country.

- Sarah didn’t want to move the sick baby.

- She was terrified, because cholera is almost always fatal (deadly).

**“Cures for a Penny”**

- People were desperate and willing to try anything.

- Newspapers were full of advertisements for miraculous remedies.

- Doctors prescribed dangerous treatments like addictive laudanum, calomel, and poisonous camphor.

- Today we know that lots of clean water is the cure for cholera. Patients need to stay hydrated.

- If properly treated, less than one percent of people who get the disease will die.

**“It’s All Gone Quiet”**

- Baby Frances died the next day. Dr. Rogers noted the cause of death as exhaustion from an attack of diarrhea.

- Broad Street was deserted (empty) and quiet.

- A doctor and a scientist named John Snow appeared. He took out a small glass bottle. He filled it with water from the Broad Street Pump.
