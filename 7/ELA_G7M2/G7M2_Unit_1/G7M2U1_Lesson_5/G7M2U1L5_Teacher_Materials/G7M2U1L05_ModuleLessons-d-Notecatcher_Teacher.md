**Part III: Be the Detective**

Without reading ahead, what is the author suggesting about how the cesspool and the water pump might be related to the spread of cholera? Make inferences and use evidence and clues from this excerpt to support your inferences.

The author is suggesting that the illness is spreading from the cesspool to the water pump. On page 34, she writes about how Sarah would dump buckets of waste into the cesspool and then “continued over a few paces” to fill her water buckets. This shows that the cesspool and water pump were close. Then John Snow comes and appears to take samples of the water from the pump near the cesspool. He believes he had “solved the mystery of cholera”: (38). This also shows that the illness is related to the water.
