Epidemics

Grade 7: Module 2: Unit 1: Lesson 5

Lesson Overview

Lesson Summary

Students read pages 32–38 of *Patient Zero*, determining the gist and noting new vocabulary. Then students work independently to analyze how the author structures the text, how major sections contribute to the whole and to the development of ideas. Students close the lesson checking their understanding of the text’s structure by answering selected and constructed response questions similar to those they will see on the mid-unit assessment.

Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- L.7.4 – Opening A: On an entrance ticket, students practice using strategies to determine the meanings of unfamiliar words.

- RI.7.5 – Work Time B: Students identify structures in *Patient Zero*, pages 32–38, and analyze how sections contribute to the whole text and develop ideas.

- RI.7.5 – Closing and Assessment A: Students answer a constructed response question to check their understanding of how the author uses structure to develop ideas in *Patient Zero*.

- The Think-Pair-Shareprotocol is used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- In the excerpt of *Patient Zero* read in this lesson, Sarah Lewis demonstrated compassion and empathy for her baby as she struggled with cholera. She demonstrated perseverance as she tried against all odds to keep her baby alive.

- Note there is a differentiated version of the *Patient Zero* Lesson 5 note-catcher used in Work Time B in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release more responsibility more quickly to students as they comprehend the tasks or concepts. For example:

- Allow those students who are identifying the gist and other elements quickly the opportunity to develop their own text-dependent questions about the chapter, related to structure. Ask these students to share their questions with the group as a way of generating discussion. (RI.7.5)

- For the “Be the Detectives” activity in Closing and Assessment A, ask students to compose short synopsis of the mystery as they’ve understood it so far.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students have focused on analyzing the structure of *Patient Zero*. In this lesson, students expand on this work while also looking more closely at how the author structures the narrative section itself, in this case to build a sense of mystery.

Support All Students

- At this point, students should be reading the text independently. However, if some or all students need more support, read several pages aloud and then release students to read independently, in pairs, or in small groups. ▲

- The subject matter in this excerpt includes descriptions of death and disease. Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this chapter that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually.

- To support ELLs, this lesson provides a familiar note-catcher similar to those used in previous lessons and with the same type of tasks and questions as the mid-unit assessment, scaffolding students toward independent analyses of text structure. Also, the repeated pauses and whole-class sharings of responses ensure students remain on the right track during this independent work.

- ELLs may find it challenging to complete the note-catcher and conduct other text structure analysis independently. Grouping students who are not yet ready for independence and providing partial or light supports as indicated below may be a necessary last step before the independent assessment in the following lessons.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, 7.I.B.6, 7.I.C.10, 7.I.C.12, and 7.II.A.1.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ *Patient Zero* Lesson 5 note-catcher to ensure students understand how the author structures the text in order to develop ideas.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will demonstrate their skills in analyzing the structure of the text during a mid-unit assessment, when they will analyze how part of the text relates to the whole.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.7.4 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 5**.

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique to review their responses. Then add *intravenously* and *pestilence* to the **domain-specific word wall** with translations in home languages where appropriate, and invite students to add the word to their **vocabulary logs**.

- Repeated routine: follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read *Patient Zero*, Pages 32–38 (up to “Know Your Enemy”) – SL.7.1 (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: follow the same process as with previous lessons for students to read pages 32–38 (up to “Know Your Enemy”) of ***Patient Zero***, using the **Text Guide: *Patient Zero*** **(for teacher reference)** as necessary. If students do not finish reading the excerpt within the allotted time, use the **Synopsis: *Patient Zero***, **Pages 32–38** document to review the key details from the excerpt. Then have students identify the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary, reflect on their reading as they choose, and record the overall gist on **sticky notes** using the following resources as appropriate: vocabulary logs, **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**, and **Questions about Epidemics anchor chart**.

- Gist: Baby Frances struggled then died possibly from cholera; stranger took sample of water from pump.

- Once students have finished reading and reflecting on the excerpt, ask them to Think-Pair-Share:

“Which habit of character did Sarah Lewis demonstrate in this excerpt?” (Responses will vary, but may include: Sarah Lewis demonstrated compassion and empathy for her baby as she struggled with cholera. She demonstrated perseverance when she tried against all odds to keep her baby alive.)

- Now that students have read a significant portion of the text, consider asking for volunteers to share their strategies for reading this particular text. For example, do they pause their reading of the narrative to explore the additional sections? Lead a whole-class discussion of these different strategies, and consider sharing how to approach reading texts like this. Ask students to consider again why the author structures the text in this way, and how the combination of the narration and the additional sections help her achieve her purpose. Emphasize that there isn’t a correct way to read the text. Students should try different methods to find the one that works best for them.

For Lighter Support

- Before the Think-Pair-Share in Work Time A, remind students of the language chunk they learned in the previous lesson: “ . . . showed (or other verb) . . . when/because he/she . . . .” Challenge students to use this language chunk in their response.

Work Time

B. Analyze Structure: *Patient Zero*, Pages 32–38 – RI.7.5 (20 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify the structures Peters uses to organize pages 32–38 of *Patient Zero*.”

“I can explain how sections of *Patient Zero* contribute to the whole chapter.”

- Draw students’ attention to the **Text Structure anchor chart**, and remind them that they will use this as a reference when analyzing the structure of the text. Refer to **Text Structure anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Distribute the ***Patient Zero*** **Lesson 5 note-catcher** and the ***Patient Zero*** **Lesson 5 note-catcher** ▲ as necessary. The differentiated note-catcher supports students in analyzing structures with a descriptive list of the different organizational structures and sentence starters. ▲ Instruct students to work individually to fill out the chart in Part I, matching the gists to the section titles. Circulate and support as necessary.

- Ask for student volunteers to share out their answers to Part I of the note-catcher. Invite students to Turn and Talk with a neighbor about how they matched these sections. Reference the ***Patient Zero*** **Lesson 5 note-catcher (answers for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Invite students to work individually to answer the first selected response question in Part II of the note-catcher. When students are ready, ask for volunteers to share out their answers to the first question in Part II. Circulate to offer extra support. Consider asking questions such as, “What kind of information is being given in this section? How is it organized?” ▲

- Inform students that they will continue to work independently to answer the remaining selected response questions in Part II of the note-catcher. Circulate to offer support for answering these questions.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time B, invite students to use the *Patient Zero* Lesson 5 note-catcher ▲. This resource supports students in analyzing structures with a descriptive list of the different organizational structures and sentence starters.

Closing and Assessment

A. Check for Understanding – RI.7.5 (5 minutes)

- Ask students to work independently to answer the question in Part III of their *Patient Zero* Lesson 5 note-catcher, the section labeled “Be the Detectives.” When students are ready, ask for volunteers to share out their answers to this question. Lead a whole-class discussion to reflect on how the author structures the text to help set up “mystery” of cholera in the text. (Responses will vary, but may include: The author tells the story of baby Frances’ sickness, referring to the cesspool and the water pump. Then she introduces a mysterious man who takes a sample of water from the pump. The author tells what the man does but not why. This sets up the mystery and makes the readers want to be detectives to put the pieces together: Is the cesspool connected to the water pump? Are people getting sick from the water?)

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- Before beginning the whole-class discussion, post the prompts listed in the lesson and challenge students to create sentence starters to answer each one. They can share these sentence starters with their classmates who need heavier support. Creating sentence starters gives students confidence with language structures they can use in their discussions.

For Heavier Support

- Before beginning the whole-class discussion, post the prompts listed in the lesson and provide students with sentence starters to answer each one. (These may come from their classmates who need lighter support.) Allow time for students to complete the sentence starters in writing and orally rehearse their statements with a partner. Writing down and practicing sentences they can use in a discussion gives students confidence to increase their successful participation.

Homework

A. Determine Meaning of Unfamiliar Vocabulary

- Students use context and, if necessary, a dictionary to determine the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary in pages 32–38 (up to “Know Your Enemy”) of *Patient Zero*. Students then record the words and their definitions in the correct section of their vocabulary log.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread pages 38–40 (up to “The Grand Experiment”) and 41 of *Patient Zero* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.

For Lighter Support

- As in Lessons 2–3, provide students with the Synopsis: *Patient Zero*, Pages 38–41, and ask them to highlight and illustrate the synopsis after they have completed their prereading.

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from chapter 2 of *Patient Zero*. Provide ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Invite students to predict some of the questions that the Language Dive may ask. This will improve students’ metacognition and challenge their awareness of the most interesting or meaningful elements of the sentence.

For Heavier Support

- As in Lessons 2–3, provide students with the highlighted Synopsis: *Patient Zero*, Pages 38–41, and ask them to illustrate the synopsis before they complete their prereading.

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from chapter 2 of *Patient Zero*. Provide ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Encourage students to independently reflect on this sentence and its meaning before the next lesson. Students may also wish to use dictionaries to add any unknown vocabulary and meanings to their vocabulary logs.
