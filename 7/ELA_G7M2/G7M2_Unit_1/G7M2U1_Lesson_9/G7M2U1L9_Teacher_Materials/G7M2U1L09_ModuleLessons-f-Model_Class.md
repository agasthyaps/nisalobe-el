Model Constructed Response

RI.7.3, W.7.10

**Constructed Response Questions:** How did John Snow’s idea about the spread of disease differ from those of most people at the time? How did the important individuals, events, and ideas in the text interact to show that Snow’s idea was correct?

John Snow thought that cholera could be spread through the water, while most people still thought it was spread through bad air, or miasma. Individuals, events and ideas all interacted to prove that he was right. Henry Whitehead helped him find information about the spread of cholera. Events also helped. Susannah Eley got sick across town from drinking the Broad Street water. Others who lived close by and didn’t drink the water did not get sick. This helped prove his point. Also, Snow’s idea to map the outbreak helped. Finally, Snow’s mindset helped him prove how the outbreak was being spread.
