<p>Lesson 8</p>
<p><strong>Patient Zero:</strong></p>
<p>The first person who gets sick is Frances Lewis. Her mother Sarah Lewis emptied her child’s feces in cesspool near the pump because she didn’t know any better.</p>
<p>(Habits of Character):</p>
<p>Her mother tries to help by shutting the windows, hoping that would save her daughter.</p>
<p>This shows that she is compassionate towards her daughter.</p>
<p><strong>Investigators:</strong></p>
<p>One of the investigators is John Snow. To investigate the epidemic he collected water samples and asked people where they got their water from.</p>
<p>Another investigator is Henry Whitehead. To investigate the epidemic he gathered information from people about the disease.</p>
<p>Lesson 9</p>
<p>Whitehead discovers the death certificate of <strong>Frances Lewis, who was patient zero.</strong></p>
<p>(Habits of Character):</p>
<p>The first investigator shows perseverance and initiative when he studied cholera for twenty years and when he went from door to door.</p>
<p>The second investigator shows perseverance when he didn’t agree with Snow at first but helped him investigate, and by working hard to solve the mystery.</p></td>

<p>Lesson 9</p>
<p>Diseases are really spread through <strong>germs.</strong></p>

<p>When sanitation is bad, <strong>such as during natural disasters, cholera comes back.</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Social</p>
<p>Lesson 9</p>
<p>Sanitation is important because <strong>it keeps people healthy. People needed better sanitation habits.</strong></p>
<p>Sewer systems are important because <strong>they prevent the spread of disease. Cities around the world built better sewage systems like London after the outbreak.</strong></p></td>
