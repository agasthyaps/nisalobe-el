Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.7.4 – Opening A: On an entrance ticket, students practice using strategies to determine the impact of word choice on meaning and tone.

- RI.7.3 – Work Time B: Students identify individuals, ideas, and events in *Patient Zero*, pages 50–54, and analyze how they interact in the text.

- SL.7.1 – Work Time C: Students engage in a collaborative discussion in which they analyze the interactions of individuals, events, and ideas in the text.

- W.7.5 – Closing and Assessment A: Students collaborate to give a peer feedback on their constructed response in preparation for writing constructed responses throughout the unit and on the end of unit assessment.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners by collaborating with peers in analyzing the interactions among elements of a text. They also focus on working to become ethical people by showing respect and compassion as they give feedback to their peer’s constructed response.

- The Jigsaw protocol is used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- If a whole-class critique will not work for the class at this time, use the Model Constructed Response and work as a class to revise the work.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release more responsibility more quickly to students as they comprehend the tasks or concepts. For example:

- Encourage groups who finish discussing earlier to begin answering the selected and constructed response questions to synthesize the chapter. Invite groups who finish the questions earlier to draft their own “toolboxes” as on pages 47–48 of other important actions or character traits that John Snow exhibited in his investigation. (RI.7.3)

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students began their investigation of how the individuals, events, and ideas interact in the text. In this lesson, students continue that analysis, including how the cholera epidemic affected people’s ideas about diseases.

Support All Students

- At this point, students should be reading the text independently. However, if some or all students need more support, read several pages aloud and then release students to read independently, in pairs, or in small groups. ▲

- The subject matter in this excerpt includes descriptions of death and disease. Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this chapter that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually.

- Students may need additional support understanding the distinctions among individuals, events, and ideas in the text. Continue to work with students to point out specific examples in the text. Consider using examples from other texts or from history to aid students in understanding the concept. ▲

- Note there is a differentiated version of the Solve *Patient Zero*, Chapter 2 note-catcher (begun in Lesson 8) used in Work Time B in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- For the discussion in Work Time C, consider strategically grouping students into heterogeneous groups of four, containing a pair of students at one level and a pair of students at a different level. This will help students feel comfortable participating at their level but also challenge them to participate in heterogeneous groups as required at the end of unit discussion. Consider asking a group of students who are confident speakers to model a short discussion, and encourage all other students to note language and ideas they will use in their own discussions. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson continues the use of the same flowchart note-catcher, which students work in small groups to complete. The graphic and collaborative support helps ELLs succeed in abstract analysis of the interactions among individuals, events, and ideas in the text.

- ELLs may find it challenging to participate in the whole-class constructed response critique in Closing and Assessment A. ELLs and other students may not be accustomed to or comfortable with criticizing others’ work in public. Take time to explain the value and benefit of working together to help one another achieve high-quality work. Ensure that the student whose work is the focus of the critique is 100 percent on board with participating in the critique. Also, play the Austin’s Butterfly video, pausing frequently to discuss and highlight how critique pushed Austin to create beautiful, high-quality work.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, 7.I.B.6, 7.I.C.10, 7.I.C.12, and 7.II.C.6.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ *Patient Zero* Lesson 9 note-catchers to ensure students understand how individuals, ideas, and events interact in the text.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue to analyze *Patient Zero* for the interaction among individuals, ideas, and events and practice discussing.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Ensure there is a copy of Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 9 at each student’s workspace.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous modules to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

- Closing and Assessment A: Use a document camera or projector to display student constructed response and the *Austin’s Butterfly* video (http://eled.org/austins-butterfly) as necessary for peer critique modeling.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.7.4 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 9**.

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique to review their responses. Then add *gets a* *foothold* to the **domain-specific word wall** with translations in home languages where appropriate, and invite students to add the phrase to their **vocabulary logs**.

- Repeated routine: follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read *Patient Zero*, Pages 45–46, 48, and 50–51 (10 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same process as with previous lessons for students to reread pages 45–46, 48, and 50–51 of ***Patient Zero***, using the **Text Guide: *Patient Zero* (for teacher reference)** as necessary. If students do not finish reading the excerpt within the allotted time, use the **Synopsis: *Patient Zero***, **Pages 45–46, 48, and 50–51** document to review the key details from the excerpt. Then have students identify the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary, reflect on their reading as they choose, and record the overall gist on **sticky notes** using the following resources as appropriate: vocabulary logs, **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**, and **Questions about Epidemics anchor chart**.

- Gist: Snow invented mapping and shoe-leather method.

For Lighter Support

- At the end of Work Time A, challenge students to prepare for the analysis work they will do in Work Time B by listing on their copies of Synopsis: *Patient Zero*, Pages 45–46, 48, and 50–51 the key individuals (people), events, and ideas (beliefs about disease) that they read about in the chapter. They can share this list with their classmates who need heavier support.

For Heavier Support

- At the end of Work Time A, support students to prepare for the analysis work they will do in Work Time B by working with their classmates who need lighter support to highlight on their copies of Synopsis: *Patient Zero*, Pages 45–46, 48, and 50–51 the key individuals (people), events, and ideas (beliefs about disease) that they read about in the chapter.

Work Time

B. Analyze Interactions among Individuals, Events, and Ideas: *Patient Zero*, Pages 45–46, 48, and 50–51 – RI.7.3 (10 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify key individuals, events, and ideas in a text.”

“I can analyze how individuals, ideas, and events influence one another.”

- Ask students to retrieve their **Solve *Patient Zero***, **Chapter 2 note-catcher (pages 40–45, 47, and 49)** and the **Solve *Patient Zero***, **Chapter 2 note-catcher (pages 40–45, 47, and 49)** ▲ as necessary. The differentiated note-catcher supports students in analyzing interactions among individuals, events, and ideas with sentence starters. ▲

- Inform students that they will continue their work from the previous lesson filling out their note-catchers, adding in new information from pages 45–46, 48, and 50–51. Remind students of the purpose of each of the boxes in the note-catcher, and allow time for any questions. Then release students to fill in their note-catchers in pairs or triads.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- At the end of Work Time B, if time allows, challenge students to act out the flowchart by assigning students roles of “most people,” patient zero, investigators, and narrator. (Partner students at varied levels for roles, so students who need lighter support can model actions for their classmates who need heavier support.) The narrator reads from the flowchart while the other students act out the ideas, events, and individual actions. For example, the narrator might read, “Before the cholera epidemic, most people believed that miasma or bad air caused disease.” The students playing the role of “most people” would pantomime smelling bad air and getting sick. Enacting the flowchart helps students and their classmates who need heavier support visualize the abstract interactions from the text.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time B, invite students to use the Solve *Patient Zero*, Chapter 2 note-catcher ▲ from Lesson 8. The sentence starters in this resource support students in analyzing the interactions of individuals, events, and ideas.

- At the end of Work Time B, if time allows, challenge students to act out the flowchart by assigning students roles of “most people,” patient zero, investigators, and narrator. (Partner students at varied levels for roles, so students who need heavier support can follow and imitate the actions of their classmates who need lighter support.) The narrator reads from the flowchart while the other students act out the ideas, events, and individual actions. For example, the narrator might read, “Before the cholera epidemic, most people believed that miasma or bad air caused disease.” The students playing the role of “most people” would pantomime smelling bad air and getting sick. Enacting the flowchart helps students and their classmates who need heavier support visualize the abstract interactions from the text.

Work Time

C. Discuss Interactions among Individuals, Events, and Ideas: *Patient Zero*, Pages 45–46, 48, and 50–51 – SL.7.1 (10 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify the individuals, events, and ideas in a text.”

“I can analyze how individuals, ideas, and events influence one another.”

- Invite students to form small groups to discuss the new events, actions, or ideas that they discovered in this excerpt. Circulate and support students in identifying these elements, referring to the **Solve *Patient Zero***, **Chapter 2 note-catcher (pages 45–46, 48, and 50–51) (for teacher reference)**.

- Refocus groups and use a total participation technique (e.g., cold call or equity sticks) to invite students from each group to discuss the new elements of the text they identified and how they interact to change our ideas about disease.

- To prompt a more detailed discussion, consider asking students the following questions:

“How did discovering Frances Lewis’ death certificate (45) influence Whitehead’s ideas about the epidemic?” (It showed him that the epidemic had started earlier than he thought, and was likely caused by Frances.)

“What language does the author use on page 46 to convey the importance of this discovery to Whitehead?” (The author writes that Whitehead’s hands “began trembling” and his “brain whirled” to show how excited he was by the discovery.)

“How do the ‘Tools of the Trade’ sections on pages 47–48 show how John Snow’s actions and ideas continue to be influential today?” (The sections describe why “Snow is called the father of epidemiology” by explaining how his techniques are still used. On page 47, the author explains that Snow’s map is “still studied” by students of epidemiology. On page 48, the author says that the “shoe-leather” method Snow invented is “still one of the most valuable ways” epidemiologists collect information.)

For Lighter Support

- Before releasing students to begin their small group discussions in Work Time C, post the follow-up questions and challenge students to create sentence starters to answer each one. Remind students to also create sentence starters to give evidence that supports their responses. They can share these sentence starters with their classmates who need heavier support. Creating sentence starters gives students confidence with language structures they can use in their discussions.

For Heavier Support

- Before releasing students to begin their small group discussions in Work Time C, post the follow-up questions and provide students with sentence starters to answer each one. (These may come from their classmates who need lighter support.) Allow time for students to complete the sentence starters in writing and orally rehearse their statements with a partner. Writing down and practicing sentences they can use in a discussion gives students confidence to increase their successful participation.

Closing and Assessment

A. Whole-Group Constructed Response Critique – W.7.5 (10 minutes)

- Explain that the class will work together to review one of the student’s constructed responses from the previous lesson’s homework (or use the **Model Constructed Response** for this critique).

- Together with students, create a **Criteria of an Effective Constructed Response anchor chart**. Ask students to grapple and Think-Pair-Share:

“What are the criteria of an effective constructed response paragraph?” (topic sentence that restates the question, statements that answer the question, evidence from the text that supports the ideas in the statements, etc.)

- Correct and refine student responses, recording key criteria on the anchor chart.

- Display and read aloud the student or model constructed response. Use the anchor chart to identify one or two areas that have consistently needed improvement in most students’ writing (e.g., students may be struggling to write concisely or identify the best evidence to support their ideas). To support all students, write these area(s) on the board and offer some general examples (not from the students’ writing). To increase engagement and investment, have students review their own constructed responses and determine which area they think they need to address. Ask the class to vote on the most important area(s) to address.

- Focus students on the Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart, and remind them of respect, empathy, and compassion, as this is someone’s personal written work. If necessary, model and guide students to practice giving courteous and constructive feedback. Optionally, show the ***Austin’s Butterfly*** **video** (http://eled.org/austins-butterfly) to model constructive feedback. Also, provide sentence frames on the board, read them aloud, and model using them:

“I like how you \_\_\_\_\_, but I don’t understand \_\_\_\_\_. Can you \_\_\_\_\_? I like how you \_\_\_\_\_, but I think \_\_\_\_\_ needs revision because \_\_\_\_\_. Can you \_\_\_\_\_?” ▲

- Focus the class on the first area of need, and use a Think Aloud to model explaining the problem and brainstorming ideas for fixing it. (E.g., “There doesn’t seem to be a topic sentence that restates the question. Let’s reread the question and work together to restate it as a topic sentence.” or “This doesn’t seem to be the strongest evidence to support this idea. How can we find better evidence to support this idea?”) Invite volunteers to join in brainstorming ideas for revising the piece. Ask students to Think-Pair-Share about which solution they think is best and why. Come to a consensus about which revision(s) to recommend to the writer. Note this on the displayed copy of the summary.

- Focus the class on the area of need, and have students work as a class to generate suggestions. Continue this process, eventually releasing students to work independently or in pairs to identify areas in need of revision and generate suggestions.

- Incorporate reflection on and awareness of the following academic mindset: “I belong in this community.” Have students reference the **Mindsets and Habits of Character** handout as needed.

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“How do respect, empathy, and compassion help you feel a sense of belonging in this classroom community?” (Responses will vary, but may include: when my classmates listen to me, I feel like I have a safe place in this classroom.)

Homework

A. Revise Constructed Response

- Students use the lessons learned from the whole group critique activity and **Homework: Revise Constructed Response** to revise their own constructed responses.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread pages 72–78 of *Patient Zero* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.
