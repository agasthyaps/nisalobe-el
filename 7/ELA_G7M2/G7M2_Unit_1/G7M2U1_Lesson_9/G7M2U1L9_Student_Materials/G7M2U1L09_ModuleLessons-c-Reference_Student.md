**Name:** **Date:**

**“The Final Clue”**

- Whitehead found baby Frances Lewis’ death certificate and realized that she was the first case of cholera.

- She had cholera for two days before the general outbreak in the neighborhood.

- Whitehead wondered if throwing the baby’s diarrhea into the cesspool contaminated the water.

- When Whitehead and Snow discussed this with Sarah Lewis, they discovered the location of the cesspool next to the pump and knew that the baby was the source of the epidemic.

**“The Shoe-Leather Method”**

- John Snow is now known as the father of epidemiology.

- He created the first map of an outbreak, and he carefully studied the spread of disease.

- Before Snow, doctors didn’t compare data about the patients they treated to data from healthy people in the same area to look for similarities and differences.

- Snow’s method of knocking on doors is called “shoe-leather epidemiology” and is really important today.

**“The Dirty Truth” and “Cholera: Everything Old is New Again”**

- Snow and Whitehead convinced the church council to excavate (dig up) the cesspool and pump.

- The excavation showed that the earth between the cesspool and the well beneath the pump was soaked with sewage.

- Baby Frances’ diarrhea infected the whole neighborhood.

- A few years later, London installed (put in) a modern sewage system. Other cities soon followed.

- Modern sanitation (cleanliness) helped stop cholera for forty years.

- In 2010, cholera hit Haiti after an earthquake. It hit Haiti again in 2016 after Hurricane Matthew, and almost 10,000 people died.

- Cholera strikes with natural disasters, war, and instability (unrest or disorder).
