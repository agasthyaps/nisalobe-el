Discussion Norms Anchor Chart

SL.7.1

(Example for Teacher Reference)

I listen carefully and wait my turn to speak. (I do not interrupt.)

I ask questions to better understand what people are saying.

I make comments that contribute to the discussion.

I respond to questions to help people better understand what I am saying and to build on the discussion.

I stay on topic.

I link my ideas to those of others.

I speak in complete sentences.

I assume positive intent.

**I acknowledge when others express new ideas: “\_\_\_\_\_ just said something new. I’d like to hear more about what \_\_\_\_\_ said.”**

**When warranted, I modify my views: “\_\_\_\_\_’s comments have made me change my mind. I used to think \_\_\_\_\_. Now I think \_\_\_\_\_.”**
