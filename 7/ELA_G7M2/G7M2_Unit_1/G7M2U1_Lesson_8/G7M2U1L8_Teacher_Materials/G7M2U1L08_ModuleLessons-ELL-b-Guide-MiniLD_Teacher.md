5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

RI.7.3, L.7.1a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

**Despite their differences,** the shy doctor and the young minister made a good team. (from page 44 of *Patient Zero* by Marilee Peters)

**Lesson 8 Placement**

Lead this Mini after students read the text in Work Time A.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target **(I can analyze how individuals, ideas, and events interact with one another.)** and RI.7.3 by providing students with an opportunity to analyze the interactions between two individuals, John Snow and Henry Whitehead, during the Soho Cholera Outbreak of 1854. The sentence also helps students to address L.7.1a by providing an example of a phrase functioning as an adverb, which is used to add contextual information to the main clause of the sentence. Supporting standard: SL.7.1

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses a prepositional phrase functioning as an adverbial phrase with the purpose of adding information to a sentence that describes interaction between two individuals.

- Transfer: adverbial phrase + independent clause, when analyzing structure in *Patient Zero* on the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment and the End of Unit 1 Assessment. Students can also apply this structure when carrying out various writing tasks throughout this module and Modules 3 and 4.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **<u>Despite their differences,</u> the shy doctor and the young minister made a good team.**

- Ask:

“What is this sentence about?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“Who are the shy doctor and the young minister?” (John Snow is the young doctor, and Henry Whitehead is the young minister.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **Despite their differences,**

- Ask:

“What other words or phrases could the writer have used here instead of despite?” (regardless of; even with; in spite of; even though \[they had\]; although \[they had\])

“Can you figure out if this chunk is a phrase or a clause? How do you know?” (We know this is a phrase because it starts with a preposition and does not have a subject or a verb.)

- As needed, remind students that phrases that start with prepositions are called prepositional phrases.

“What do you think the function of this prepositional phrase is in this sentence? Is it a noun, an adjective, or an adverb? How do you know?” (An adverb. It gives us more information about the verb phrase in the clause that follows \[made a good team\], and we know that adverbs describe verbs and adjectives.)

- Tell students that when prepositional phrases function as adverbs, we call them adverb phrases or adverbial phrases.

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **<u>Despite their differences,</u> the shy doctor and the young minister made a good team.**

- Ask:

“Can we move Despite their differences, anywhere else in this sentence?” (Yes, we can also put it at the end or before the verb phrase between minister and made.)

- As time allows, invite students to write out three versions of the sentence, each with the adverb phrase in a different place. For heavier support, display the following sentences and ask students to notice the placement of the phrase, as well as variance in the use of commas and capitalization among the sentences:

> **Despite their differences,** the shy doctor and the young minister made a good team.
>
> The shy doctor and the young minister, **despite their differences,** made a good team.
>
> The shy doctor and the young minister made a good team **despite their differences**.

- Ask:

“What if we remove Despite their differences?” (The sentence still makes sense, but we no longer have as much information about the interactions between John Snow and Henry Whitehead.)

“How can we use adverbial phrases in our speaking or writing?” (to add information that describes the main action in a sentence)

- Ask:

“What does this sentence tell us about the interactions between John Snow and Henry Whitehead?” (They worked well together even though they sometimes disagreed.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target  
(I can analyze how individuals, ideas, and events interact with one another.)?”  
(Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, **John Snow determined each location where water**

adverbial phrase

> **infected with Cholera had come from.**
>
> (preposition + noun phrase = adverbial phrase)

- Say:

“Add an adverbial phrase to the sentence to add additional information about the verb phrase in the main clause.”

- Note: For heavier support, display the following adverbial phrases for students to choose from to complete the sentence frame:

> **After extensive research,**
>
> **By mapping out each case,**
>
> **With careful detail,**

- Answers will vary, but may include:

> **<u>After extensive research</u>**, **John Snow determined each location where water**
>
> adverbial phrase
>
> **infected with Cholera had come from.**
>
> (preposition + noun phrase = adverbial phrase)
