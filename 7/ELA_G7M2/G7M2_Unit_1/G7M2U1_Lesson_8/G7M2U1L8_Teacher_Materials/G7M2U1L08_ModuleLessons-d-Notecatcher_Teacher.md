<p>Lesson 8</p>
<p>The first person who gets sick <strong>is Frances Lewis. Her mother Sarah Lewis emptied her child’s feces in a cesspool near the pump because she didn’t know any better.</strong></p>
<p>(Habits of Character):</p>
<p>Her mother tries to help by <strong>shutting the windows, hoping that would save her daughter.</strong></p>
<p>This shows that she is <strong>compassionate towards her daughter.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Investigators:</strong></p>
<p>Lesson 8</p>
<p>One of the investigators is <strong>John Snow.</strong> To investigate the epidemic, he <strong>collected water samples and asked people where they got their water from.</strong></p>
<p>Another investigator is <strong>Henry Whitehead.</strong> To investigate the epidemic, he <strong>gathered information from people about the disease.</strong></p>
<p>(Habits of Character):</p>
<p>The first investigator shows <strong>perseverance and initiative</strong> when he <strong>studied cholera for twenty years and when he went from door to door.</strong></p>
<p>The second investigator shows <strong>perseverance</strong> when he <strong>didn’t agree with Snow at first but helped him investigate, and by working hard to solve the mystery.</strong></p></td>
