Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.7.4 – Opening A: Students analyze a quote from the text in order to determine the meanings of words and phrases and analyze the impact of author’s word choice on meaning and tone.

- RI.7.3 – Work Time B: Students analyze how individuals and events in pages 40–45, 47, and 49 of *Patient Zero* interact to change ideas about disease.

- SL.7.1 – Closing and Assessment A: Students engage in a collaborative discussion as a class about how the individuals, events, and ideas interact in pages 40–45, 47, and 49 of *Patient Zero*.

- Students focus on working to become effective learners by collaborating with peers in analyzing the interactions among elements of a text.

- The Think-Pair-Shareprotocol is used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- In the excerpt of *Patient Zero* read in this lesson, John Snow demonstrated perseverance and initiative as he tried to solve the cholera mystery. He also collaborated with Henry Whitehead in working to solve the mystery.

- Note there is a differentiated version of the Solve *Patient Zero*, Chapter 2 note-catcher used in Work Time B in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release more responsibility more quickly to students as they comprehend the tasks or concepts. For example:

- Allow those students who are identifying individuals, events, and ideas quickly the opportunity to develop their own text-dependent questions about the chapter, related to the interactions of these elements. Ask these students to share their questions with the group as a way of generating discussion. (RI.7.3)

- An optional Mini Language Dive, intended for use after students read the text in Work Time A, is available in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students have focused on analyzing the structure of *Patient Zero*. In this lesson, students continue to analyze how the author tells the stories of the various epidemics in the book, focusing on the individuals, ideas, and events and how they interact in the text.

Support All Students

- At this point, students should be reading the text independently. However, if some or all students need more support, read several pages aloud and then release students to read independently, in pairs, or in small groups. ▲

- The subject matter in this excerpt includes descriptions of death and disease. Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this chapter that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually.

- Students may need additional support understanding the distinctions among individuals, events, and ideas in the text. Continue to work with students to point out specific examples in the text. Consider using examples from other texts or from history to aid students in understanding the concept. For example, “How did the event of the invention of the computer change individuals’ lives?” ▲

- For the discussion in Closing and Assessment A, consider strategically grouping students into more homogeneous groups, so that students will feel comfortable participating at their level and even in their home language when necessary. Consider asking a group of students who are confident speakers to model a short discussion, and encourage all other students to note language and ideas they will use in their own discussions. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson includes collaboration to process reading and to begin to analyze the interactions among individuals, events, and ideas surrounding the cholera epidemic. This lesson also includes a note-catcher flowchart that supports students in visualizing these interactions.

- ELLs may find it challenging to synthesize the information they read in the text into the categories of ideas, events, and individuals. Create an anchor chart defining each of these elements with sketches and examples from the text. Also, as noted in the teaching notes of Lesson 8, group students in homogeneous groups for this first discussion in Closing and Assessment A. Doing so will allow students to feel more comfortable participating at their level and even in their home language when necessary.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, 7.I.B.6, and 7.II.C.6.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Solve *Patient Zero* Chapter 2 note-catchers as well as the Solve *Patient Zero* Questions for Lesson 8 to ensure students understand how the elements in the text interact.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue to analyze *Patient Zero* for the interactions among individuals, ideas, and events.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.7.4 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 8**. Students will review their responses to the entrance ticket in Work Time B.

- Repeated routine: follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

- With students, use the vocabulary strategies on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart** to review the words *impact* (to influence or create a strong and powerful effect on), *interact* (to have an effect or change on one another), and *tone* (an author or character’s attitude toward a subject or person). Record on the **academic word wall** and **domain-specific word wall**, with translations in home languages, where appropriate, and invite students to record these words in their **vocabulary logs**.

Work Time

A. Read *Patient Zero*, Pages 40–45, 47, and 49 (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same process as with previous lessons for students to read pages 40–45 (up to “The Final Clue”), 47, and 49 of ***Patient Zero***, using the **Text Guide: *Patient Zero*** **(for teacher reference)** as necessary. If students do not finish reading the excerpt within the allotted time, use the **Synopsis**: ***Patient Zero***, **Pages 40–45, 47, and 49** document to review the key details from the excerpt. Then have students identify the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary, reflect on their reading as they choose, and record the overall gist on **sticky notes** using the following resources as appropriate: vocabulary logs, **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**, and **Questions about Epidemics anchor chart**.

- Gist: Snow and Whitehead investigated cholera, found the cause.

- Once students have finished reading and reflecting on the excerpt, ask them to Think-Pair-Share:

“Which habit of character did John Snow demonstrate in this excerpt?” (Responses will vary, but may include: John Snow demonstrated perseverance and initiative as he tried to solve the cholera mystery. He also collaborated with Henry Whitehead to solve the mystery.)

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time A, students may note the author’s use of dashes on page 40. For further practice with dashes from the Language Dive in Lessons 6–7, ask students to consider each sentence and determine the purpose of each dash. To guide students’ analysis, ask, “Why did the author use a dash here?” If necessary, follow up with questions such as, “Does the dash emphasize information or make a connection between information?”

- At the end of Work Time A, challenge students to prepare for the analysis work they will do in Work Time B by listing on their copies of Synopsis: *Patient Zero*, Pages 40–45, 47, and 49 the key individuals (people), events, and ideas (beliefs about disease) that they read about in the chapter. They can share this list with their classmates who need heavier support.

- After Work Time A, invite students to participate in a Mini Language Dive in small groups to explore a sentence from *Patient Zero* to analyze the interactions between two individuals, John Snow and Henry Whitehead, during the Soho Cholera Outbreak of 1854. To address L.7.1a, this sentence provides an example of a phrase functioning as an adverb, which is used to add contextual information to the main clause of the sentence. Students continue to explore L.7.1a and how phrases and clauses function within sentences in Language Dives and Mini Language Dives throughout this module.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time A, note the author’s use of dashes on page 40. For further practice with dashes from the Language Dive in Lessons 6–7, ask students to reread each sentence and determine the purpose of each dash. To guide students’ analysis, ask, “Why did the author use a dash here? Does the dash emphasize information or make a connection between information?”

- At the end of Work Time A, support students to prepare for the analysis work they will do in Work Time B by working with their classmates who need lighter support to highlight on their copies of Synopsis: *Patient Zero*, Pages 40–45, 47, and 49 the key individuals (people), events, and ideas (beliefs about disease) that they read about in the chapter.

Work Time

B. Analyze Interactions among Individuals, Events, and Ideas: *Patient Zero*, Pages 40–45, 47, and 49 – RI.7.3 (15 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify the individuals, events, and ideas in a text.”

“I can analyze how individuals, ideas, and events interact with one another.”

- Ask students what their understanding of these learning targets is. Ask students what they think it means for individuals, ideas, and events to influence one another. Can they think of examples where an event or idea influenced an individual in history or in their own lives? Can they think of examples where individuals influenced events or changed people’s understanding of common ideas? (Student responses will vary, but should indicate an understanding that both in texts and in life, individuals, events, and ideas can interact and influence one another in complicated ways. Such examples might include how the invention of the computer changed people’s lives, or how the idea that people should govern themselves helped inspire the American Revolution.)

- Inform students that for the rest of the unit they will be analyzing how individuals, ideas, and events interact in *Patient Zero*. They are doing this to understand not just what happened, but why it happened the way it did. Just like the epidemic detectives in *Patient Zero*, students will be looking closely at the facts in front of them to make sense of the story.

- Distribute copies of the **Solve *Patient Zero***, **Chapter 2 note-catcher** and the **Solve *Patient Zero***, **Chapter 2 note-catcher** ▲ as necessary. The differentiated note-catcher supports students in analyzing interactions among individuals, events, and ideas with sentence starters. ▲ Point out that it was designed to capture how the events of an epidemic and the individuals who respond to it changed our ideas about the nature of disease, both from a scientific or medical perspective and from a social perspective. Lead a whole-class discussion to guide students through the flow of the note-catcher:

- Start with the “Ideas about Disease <u>before</u> the Epidemic” box, which is where students will describe how people thought of disease in general before the outbreak the chapter covers—in this case, cholera.

- Direct students’ attention to the “Major <u>Events</u> of the Cholera Epidemic” and “Actions of Key <u>Individuals</u>” boxes. Explain that here they will record the events of the epidemic and how individuals responded to them. Tell students that on this note-catcher, they will focus only on the key individuals: the epidemic detectives and patient zero (the first person to get sick in the epidemic). The events they will focus on are the main events that happened in the epidemic.

- Focus students on the section of the “Actions for Key <u>Individuals</u>” box labeled “(Habits of Character).” Note that individuals have thoughts, actions, character traits, and mindsets, so those will be added here. Explain that students can write examples from the mindsets and habits of character they have been discussing in class since Module 1. However, students may also add new mindsets and habits that seem appropriate for the individuals. Distribute **Mindsets and Habits of Character** for reference.

- Direct students’ attention to the “Ideas about Disease <u>after</u> the Epidemic” box. Explain that the main events and key individuals above interact to change our ideas about disease; this will be captured here. Inform students that they will complete this box in the next lesson, after gaining a fuller understanding of the impact of the cholera epidemic on ideas about diseases. Also note that in the last box, “Questions about the Epidemic,” students can record any questions they have as they complete this note-catcher.

- Inform students that they will now fill in the note-catcher for what they have read of the cholera outbreak in chapter 2 so far. Tell students that for certain information, they may need to look back to the beginning of chapter 2 that they read earlier in this unit.

- Guide students to fill in the note-catcher by asking them to Think-Pair-Share:

“What were the scientific or medical ideas people had about disease before the events of this outbreak?” (People thought that disease was caused and spread by miasma, or bad air.)

- Instruct students to write their answers in the left-hand column of the first box.

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What were the social ideas people had about disease? What were the things they did and didn’t do to prevent disease? What were their opinions about who did and didn’t get disease? Which of their habits might have caused disease or made it worse?” (People were not paying attention to sanitation or hygiene. They dumped their waste right next to their water. London was described as a “city of filth.”)

- Guide students through completing the rest of the note-catcher, excluding the sections in the box labeled “Ideas about Disease <u>after</u> the Cholera Epidemic,” using the **Solve *Patient Zero***, **Chapter 2 note-catcher (pages 40–45, 47, and 49) (for teacher reference)**. Remind students that they will complete those sections in the next lesson, after gaining a fuller understanding of the impact of the cholera epidemic on ideas about diseases.

- As students work on the “Actions of Key <u>Individuals</u>” section, ask them to refer to their entrance tickets to consider how the author’s descriptions of John Snow and Henry Whitehead help define their characters and convey their actions. At this time, record *poring over* from the entrance ticket on the domain-specific word wall, with translations in home languages, where appropriate, and invite students to record this phrase in their vocabulary logs.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time B, invite students to use the Solve *Patient Zero*, Chapter 2 note-catcher ▲. The sentence starters in this resource support students in analyzing the interactions of individuals, events, and ideas.

Closing and Assessment

A. Discuss Individuals, Events, and Ideas: *Patient Zero*, Pages 40–45, 47, and 49 – SL.7.1 (10 minutes)

- Display the **Discussion Norms anchor chart**. Remind students that they have used these norms and Conversation Cues throughout Module 1. Display and read aloud the following SL.7.1d standard:

“Acknowledge new information expressed by others and, when warranted, modify their own views.”

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What does this standard mean in your own words?” (Responses will vary, but may include: Note when others express new information. When necessary, change our own views.)

“What words and phrases can you use to acknowledge new information expressed by others and to modify your own views?” (Responses will vary, but may include: “\_\_\_\_\_ just said something new. I’d like to hear more about what \_\_\_\_\_ said.” and “\_\_\_\_\_’s comments have made me change my mind. I used to think \_\_\_\_\_. Now I think \_\_\_\_\_.”)

- During the sharing, record student responses on the Discussion Norms anchor chart. Ask students to Turn and Talk to discuss which norm they will focus on in this lesson’s discussion. Reference the **Discussion Norms anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Tell students that they will now practice discussing how the individuals, events, and ideas interacted in the text in small groups. Ask students to discuss how the events and ideas they’ve identified so far interacted to change our ideas about disease. To prompt a more detailed discussion, ask groups to consider the following questions:

- What was John Snow’s “Grand Experiment” (40 and 42)?

- How did the event of the “Broad Street outbreak” influence his work on the “grand experiment”?

- How did John Snow and Henry Whitehead interact with each other? How did the two men’s ideas about the nature of cholera interact?

- Invite students to reflect on how they did on the discussion goal they set at the beginning of the discussion and the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- Before releasing students to begin their small group discussions, post the follow-up questions listed in the lesson and challenge students to create sentence starters to answer each one. Remind students to also create sentence starters to give evidence that supports their responses. They can share these sentence starters with their classmates who need heavier support. Creating sentence starters gives students confidence with language structures they can use in their discussions.

For Heavier Support

- Before releasing students to begin their small group discussions, post the follow-up questions listed in the lesson and provide students with sentence starters to answer each one. (These may come from their classmates who need lighter support.) Allow time for students to complete the sentence starters in writing and orally rehearse their statements with a partner. Writing down and practicing sentences they can use in a discussion gives students confidence to increase their successful participation.

Homework

A. Constructed Response Question

- Following the instructions on **Homework: Analyze Interactions: *Patient Zero***, **Pages 40–45, 47, and 49**, students write a paragraph synthesizing the in-class discussion about how the individuals, events, and ideas interact in pages 40–45, 47, and 49 of *Patient Zero*.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread pages 45–46, 48, and 50–51 of *Patient Zero* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.

For Lighter Support

- Allow time at the end of class for students to preview the homework prompt. Challenge students to work independently—or, if necessary, in pairs—to draft sentence starters for the topic and concluding sentences as well as sentence starters that introduce text evidence to support their response. Encourage students to share these sentence starters with their classmates who need heavier support. Drafting sentence frames for their classmates allows students to rehearse their own responses to the prompt.

- Consider whether students still need to work with the Synopsis: *Patient Zero*, Pages 45–46, 48, and 50–51 or whether they are ready to be released into prereading the text without this support. Some students may still need this support for the prereading outside of class. Some may want to quickly skim the synopsis just before reading in class, and some may be ready to forgo this support altogether. This gradual release may happen on a student-by-student basis and may occur as the result of students’ self-assessment.

For Heavier Support

- Allow time at the end of class for students to preview the homework prompt, working with a partner to read it aloud and highlight and define key words. Then students can paraphrase the prompt to a classmate who needs lighter support to check their understanding. At this time, these classmates who need lighter support can share their sentence starters to be used in completing their response. Deconstructing and paraphrasing the prompt ensures students understand the assignment.

- Provide students with the Synopsis: *Patient Zero*, Pages 45–46, 48, and 50–51, *and ask them to highlight* the key individuals, events, and ideas in the text *once they have completed their prereading*. (Italics indicate how the support is being modified to gradually release students to more independence.) Then they can make sketches in the margins of the synopsis to convey the gist of each section. Doing so *after* reading is a gradual release from the support they used up to this point but will still confirm their comprehension of the complex text.
