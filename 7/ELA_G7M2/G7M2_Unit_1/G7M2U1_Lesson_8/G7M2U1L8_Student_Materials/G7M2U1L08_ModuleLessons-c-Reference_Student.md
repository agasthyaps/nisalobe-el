**Name:** **Date:**

**“The Grand Experiment” and “The Search Broadens”**

- John Snow went house to house asking how many people had gotten sick, how many had died, and which company supplied their water.

- People in South London got their water from companies piping from the River Thames.

- The water company Southwark and Vauxhall drew its water downstream, where sewage (bodily waste) was dumped.

- The water company Lambeth piped its water from the clean part of the river upstream.

- John began his “Grand Experiment” to prove that cholera was spread through contaminated (dirty) water.

- The Broad Street outbreak began, so John worked on stopping that epidemic.

- John took samples from the local pumps in Soho.

- He knocked on doors and asked, “Has anyone in this house had cholera? Where do you get your water?”

- He discovered that everyone who drank from the Broad Street pump got sick.

**“Do You Smell What I Smell?”**

- London in 1854 was filthy (very dirty).

- Many houses weren’t connected to a sewer. They used cesspools (large underground pits where people dumped their waste) instead.

- “Night-soil men” were supposed to take the contents of the cesspools away to the edge of town.

- As the edge of town got farther and farther away, the “night-soil men” raised their prices.

- Landlords put off having their cesspools emptied. So they overflowed into cellars.

- Waste from homes that were connected to sewers went into the River Thames.

- The River Thames supplied the city’s water.

- London smelled, so it’s not surprising that people connected the smells with epidemics.

**“Can You ‘Handle’ the Truth?” and “The Picture Comes into Focus”**

- More than five hundred people died in an area of only a few blocks by September.

- Snow shared his results with the church council. He told them his water theory.

- The handle of the Broad Street pump was removed, and the epidemic ended.

- The church asked Snow to continue his investigation because it was not convinced that water was the problem.

- Henry Whitehead, the new assistant minister (religious leader) at St. Luke’s, offered to help Snow because he was convinced John Snow was wrong.

- Whitehead knocked on doors, visited homes many times, and gathered information.

- Snow studied the data (information) they collected and mapped the information.

- The map showed the deadly effects of the contaminated (polluted) well.

**“Mapping Outbreaks”**

- Snow was the first one to use maps to show how disease outbreaks are linked to risk factors in the environment.

- The map of the Soho outbreak showed the connection between the Broad Street pump and the cholera outbreak.

- Today, epidemiologists use software to map epidemics.
