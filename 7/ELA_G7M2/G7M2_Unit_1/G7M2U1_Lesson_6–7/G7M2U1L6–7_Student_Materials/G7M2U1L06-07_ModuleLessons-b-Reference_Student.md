**“Know Your Enemy”**

- John Snow had been studying cholera for more than twenty years.

- When helping miners who were dying from a cholera epidemic, he noticed terrible conditions and thought they were linked to the disease outbreak.

- He wondered if miasma (bad air) was really the cause, as others thought.

- He suspected food or water caused cholera, because ingesting (eating or drinking) them could cause diarrhea.

- He knew his ideas would be laughed at, so he waited for the opportunity (chance) to prove them.

- In the 1840s, he was one of the world’s first anesthesiologists. (He gave patients sleeping gases—ether and chloroform—while in surgery.)

- He became famous and gave chloroform to Queen Victoria during the births of two of her children.

- His knowledge of gases made him further suspect that miasmas did not cause cholera.

- In the spring of 1853, cholera swept South London along the River Thames.

- John Snow wondered where the people along the river got their drinking water.

**“The Great Debate: Miasma or Germs?”**

- The word **miasma** comes from the ancient Greek word for pollution.

- Miasma was a poisonous gas or vapor rising from rotting garbage and organic matter.

- People equated bad smells with disease.

- Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing, believed miasmas caused diseases.

- Nightingale emphasized cleanliness, hygiene, fresh air, and sunshine because of this belief.

- The connection between cleanliness and disease was germs, not smells.
