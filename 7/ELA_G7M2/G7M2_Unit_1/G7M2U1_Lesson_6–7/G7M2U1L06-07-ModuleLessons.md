Grade 7: Module 2: Unit 1: Lessons 6–7

Lesson Overview

Lesson Summary

Students read pages 38–41 of *Patient Zero*, determining the gist and noting new vocabulary. Then students participate in a Language Dive during which they explore a sentence from *Patient Zero* to better understand language structures used in the text. Finally, students complete the mid-unit assessment, answering selected and constructed response questions to determine the meanings of unfamiliar words and to analyze how the author structures the text as well as how major sections contribute to the whole and to the development of ideas.

Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.7.5 – Work Time B: In a Language Dive, students explore a sentence from *Patient Zero* to better understand how the sentence contributes to the whole chapter.

- RI.7.4 – Closing and Assessment A: Students track progress on their ability to read and analyze new text and use strategies to determine the meanings of words and phrases as they are used in the text.

- For the mid-unit assessment in Work Time C of this lesson, students use strategies to determine the meanings of unfamiliar words and phrases as they complete selected response questions. (L.7.4) Then students complete selected and constructed response questions to analyze structures Peters uses to organize sections of *Patient Zero* and develop ideas, including how the sections contribute to the whole text. (RI.7.5)

- Two lessons have been allocated for this assessment to ensure sufficient time for students to analyze structure in *Patient Zero*. If these are taught in two separate lessons rather than together as one block, revisit the learning targets and the task at the beginning of the second 45-minute lesson to remind students of the task and purpose.

- In this lesson, the habit of character focus is on working to become effective learners and ethical people. Students practice integrity and perseverance as they work independently on assessments and take responsibility as they assess their own work by tracking their progress on Reading standards.

- The Think-Pair-Shareprotocol is used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- In the excerpt of *Patient Zero* read in this lesson, John Snow demonstrated perseverance and initiative as he tried to solve the cholera mystery. He also demonstrated empathy and compassion by inventing an ether regulator, which would help patients feel less pain during surgery.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- In Work Times A and C, students may want to read the chapter silently and complete the mid-unit assessment without any instruction. Release them to do this independently if they are ready for it.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the first half of this unit, students began reading *Patient Zero*, analyzing how Peters uses structures to develop ideas. This lesson continues this analysis in an assessment.

Support All Students

- At this point, students should be reading the text independently. However, if some or all students need more support, read several pages aloud and then release students to read independently, in pairs, or in small groups.

- The subject matter in this excerpt includes descriptions of death and disease. Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this chapter that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually.

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment.

- Some students may need the text read aloud before they work on the questions. Consider inviting students who require this to sit in a group away from the rest of the students, so as not to be distracting.

- For some students, this assessment may require more than the 35 minutes allotted. Provide time over multiple days if necessary.

- To support ELLs, the assessment in this lesson consists of tasks and questions in the same format as the note-catchers students have used throughout the unit thus far. This gradual release supports students in independent achievement on this assessment.

- ELLs may find it challenging to write a constructed response independently, even with all the practice on similar tasks throughout the unit. Remind students that they have successfully completed similar activities in class, and encourage them to do their best. Help students be mindful of the amount of time they spend on each task.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, 7.I.B.6, 7.I.B.8, 7.I.C.10, 7.I.C.12, and 7.II.A.1.

Assessment Guidance

- All assessment materials (student prompt, answer key and sample student responses) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback on this assessment, use the answer key and sample student responses to help complete students’ Track Progress recording forms.

- In this assessment, students are tracking progress toward anchor standards:

- R.1: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.

- R.4: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Interpret words and phrases as they are used in a text, including determining technical, connotative, and figurative meanings, and analyze how specific word choices shape meaning or tone.

- R.10: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Read and comprehend complex literary and informational texts independently and proficiently.

- L.4: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Determine or clarify the meaning of unknown and multiple-meaning words and phrases by using context clues, analyzing meaningful word parts, and consulting general and specialized reference materials, as appropriate.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue to read *Patient Zero* and begin to analyze how individuals, ideas, and events interact in the text.

- Students’ Mid-Unit 1 Assessments will be returned in Lesson 14 with feedback.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare Mid-Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Structure: *Patient Zero*, Pages 38–41.

- Ensure there is a copy of Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lessons 6–7 at each student’s workspace.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time C: Students complete assessments online—on an online template like http://eled.org/0189, for example.

- Work Time C: Students can use print or online dictionaries (including ELL and home language dictionaries) during designated items in Part I.

- Work Time C: Students complete assessments in a word-processing document http://eled.org/0158 using speech-to-text facilities activated on devices or using an app or software such as http://eled.org/0103.

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous modules to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Return Module 1 End of Unit 3 Assessments (5 minutes)

- Return students’ **Module 1 End of Unit 3 Assessments with feedback**, and allow students time to review feedback and write their name on the board if they require support.

- Repeated routine: students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lessons 6–7**. Students may or may not choose to share their goals for this assessment with a partner.

Opening

B. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read *Patient Zero*, Pages 38–41 (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same process as with previous lessons for students to read pages 38–40 (up to “The Grand Experiment”) and 41 of ***Patient Zero***, and record the gist on **sticky notes**. Since this is an assessment, instruct students to read the text independently. However, if students need support, provide them with the **Synopsis: *Patient Zero***, **Pages 38–41**. ▲

- Gist: John Snow determined cholera was not caused by miasma (bad air) or defects in character like everyone else thought; he thought it might be caused by something in food or water.

- Once students have finished reading and reflecting on the chapter, ask them to Think-Pair-Share:

“Which habit of character did John Snow demonstrate?” (Answers will vary, but may include: John Snow demonstrated perseverance and initiative as he tried to solve the cholera mystery. He also demonstrated empathy and compassion by inventing an ether regulator, which would help patients feel less pain during surgery.)

For Lighter Support

- At the end of Work Time A, ensure students understand the excerpt they read by allowing time for them to share with a partner (who may need heavier support) their highlights and illustrations on the Synopsis: *Patient Zero*, Pages 38–40 and 41 from the previous lesson’s homework.

For Heavier Support

- At the end of Work Time A, ensure students understand the excerpt they read by allowing time for them to review with a partner (who may need lighter support) their highlights and illustrations on the Synopsis: *Patient Zero*, Pages 38–40 and 41 from the previous lesson’s homework.

Work Time

B. Language Dive: *Patient Zero*, Page 39 – RI.7.5 (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to facilitate a Language Dive with the following reflection sentence from the text:

- “But he didn’t forget about them—he waited for an opportunity to prove his theory.”

- Use the accompanying materials to facilitate the Language Dive:

- **Language Dive Guide: *Patient Zero***, **Page 39 (for teacher reference)**

- **Language Dive: *Patient Zero***, **Page 39 note-catcher**

- **Language Dive: *Patient Zero***, **Page 39 sentence chunk strips**

- **Language Dive: *Patient Zero***, **Page 39 note-catcher (example for teacher reference)**

For Lighter Support

- During the Language Dive of Work Time B, students analyze the use of the dash. Invite ELLs to remind the class what dashes are and what function they serve in a sentence. Encourage them to provide more example sentences with dashes. Teaching others helps students confirm their knowledge of language structures.

For Heavier Support

- During the Language Dive of Work Time B, some students may need additional support as they complete the sentence frame in the Practice section (I had an opportunity\_\_\_\_.). Provide a bank of options from which students can select answers to complete the frame. These may include: *to sing a solo, to meet the mayor, to prove my smarts*.

Work Time

C. Mid-Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Structure: *Patient Zero*, Pages 38–41 (35 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can determine the meanings of unfamiliar words and phrases.”

“I can identify the structures Peters uses to organize pages 38–41 of *Patient Zero*.”

“I can explain how sections of *Patient Zero* contribute to the whole chapter.”

- Distribute **Mid-Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Structure: *Patient Zero***, **Pages 38–41**, and invite students to take out their copies of *Patient Zero*.

- Tell students that for this assessment, they will use strategies to determine the meanings of unfamiliar words and phrases as they complete selected response questions. Then they will also complete selected and constructed response questions to analyze the structures Peters uses to organize sections of *Patient Zero* and develop ideas, including how the sections contribute to the whole text.

- Read aloud the directions for each part of the assessment as students follow along. Answer clarifying questions.

- Before students begin the assessment, ask them to Think-Pair-Share:

“What value does the task of a reading assessment have for you beyond this class? Why?” (Responses will vary, but may include: this task has a lot of value for me because I will have to take assessments in most of my high school and college classes and in most careers.)

“What will help you succeed on this assessment?” (Responses will vary but may include: using my strategies to answer selected response questions and writing a paragraph with a topic sentence, at least two pieces of evidence, and a concluding statement will help me succeed on this task.)

- Direct students’ attention to the following materials:

- **Academic word wall** and **domain-specific word wall**

- **Text Structure anchor chart**

- **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart**

- **Strategies to Answer Selected Response Questions anchor chart**

- **Print or online dictionaries**

- Remind students to refer to these materials as they read the assessment text and answer the assessment questions.

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence. Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart** and review perseverance, taking initiative, and taking responsibility. Remind students that because they will be reading and answering questions independently for the assessment, they will need to practice these habits.

- Invite students to begin the assessment.

- Circulate to monitor and document their test-taking skills.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- Before the mid-unit assessment in Work Time C, challenge students to underline key vocabulary in the assessment directions and prompt as you read them aloud together as a class. Also, invite students who need lighter support to restate or clarify information for students who need heavier support. These supports ensure that students understand each task included in the assessment.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time C, read the directions for the assessment aloud slowly, twice, and also post them. This ensures that ELLs who may not be able to easily follow the language of the directions have multiple opportunities to access them.

- Display a “map” of the assessment to reference while explaining directions to the mid-unit assessment. This will reduce ambiguity and give students a clearer picture of what they can expect so that they can better allocate their time and attentional resources. Provide students with colored pencils or highlighters so that they can mark up the “map” as needed. Example:

<!-- -->

- Part I:

<!-- -->

- Read the first excerpt and question.

- Read each possible answer.

- Cross out incorrect answers.

- Select the best answer to the question.

- Repeat steps 1–4 for each question in Part I.

<!-- -->

- Part II:

<!-- -->

- Repeat steps 1–4 for questions 1–3.

- Read the prompt for question 4.

- Write a paragraph with:

1.  a topic sentence that restates and answers the prompt.

2.  two pieces of evidence (quotes or examples) from the text.

3.  sentences that explain how the evidence supports your answer.

4.  a concluding sentence that restates and answers the prompt.

- To help students manage their time during the mid-unit assessment, display on the board or on a poster suggested times at which students move onto the next question. Allocate the most time to Part II item 4, the constructed response.

Closing and Assessment

A. Track Progress – RI.7.4 (15 minutes)

- Give students specific, positive feedback on their completion of the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment.

- Distribute the **Track Progress folders**; **Track Progress: Read, Understand, and Explain New Text**; and several blank sticky notes for each student.

- Focus students on the Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart. Remind them that they will take responsibility for their own learning as they track their progress.

- Distribute sticky notes so students can mark up their work with evidence. Tell them the sticky notes are for them to find evidence in their assessment work of the following criteria:

- RI.7.4

- RI.7.10

- Guide students through completing the recording form.

- Incorporate reflection on and awareness of the following academic mindsets: “I can succeed at this” and “My ability and competence grow with my effort.”

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What helped you to be successful at that task? How much effort did you put in on this task? How did your effort affect your learning?” (Responses will vary, but may include: I was successful at that task because I focused and worked hard. I also understood what I was doing and what was being asked of me, which helped me succeed as well.)

Homework

A. Determine Meaning of Unfamiliar Vocabulary

- Students use context and, if necessary, a dictionary to determine the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary in pages 38–40 (up to “The Grand Experiment”) and 41 of *Patient Zero*. Students then record the words and their definitions in the correct section of their vocabulary log.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread pages 40–45 (up to “The Final Clue”), 47, and 49 of *Patient Zero* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.

For Lighter Support

- As in Lessons 2–3, provide students with the Synopsis: *Patient Zero*, Pages 40–45, 47, and 49, and ask them to highlight and illustrate the synopsis after they have completed their prereading.

For Heavier Support

- As in Lessons 2–3, provide students with the highlighted Synopsis: *Patient Zero*, Pages 40–45, 47, and 49, and ask them to illustrate the synopsis before they complete their prereading.
