RI.7.5

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

“**But he didn’t forget about them—he waited for an opportunity to prove his theory**.”

(from page 39 of *Patient Zero* by Marilee Peters)

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: To help students address the daily learning target

  **(I can explain how sections of *Patient Zero* contribute to the whole chapter)** and RI.7.5, this sentence demonstrates Snow’s commitment to proving that miasma, contrary to the medical thinking of the day, did not cause cholera, which aligns with the structure Peters uses to organize the chapter.

- Guiding Question: To help students respond to the guiding question **(What is the role of character and mindset in solving epidemics?)**, this sentence demonstrates Snow’s perseverance and initiative as he tried to solve the cholera mystery.

- Language Structure: The first sentence is compelling because it uses the coordinating conjunction **but** with the purpose of signaling difference or surprise between this sentence and the previous sentence in the text, and the infinitive phrase **to prove his theory** to tell us more about Snow’s opportunity. Invite students to discuss each chunk briefly, but encourage extended conversation and practice with the focus structure: **to prove his theory**.

- Practice and Transfer: After discussing the focus structure, students practice using it to discuss something in their lives. Students transfer their understanding of the meaning and structure of this sentence when discussing how Marilee Peters structures sections of chapter 2 in *Patient Zero*, and when writing their paragraph on the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment.

**Key**

<u>Green</u>

Deconstruct

- Invite students to put their finger by this sentence from *Patient Zero* on their note-catchers: “**But he didn’t forget about them—he waited for an opportunity <u>to prove his theory</u>**.”

- Read aloud the sentence twice, and then ask students to take turns reading it aloud with their partners.

- Ask:

“What does this sentence mean to you?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“How does this sentence add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

But

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **But**

- Remind students that highlighting language can help them notice important structures and patterns.

- Underline But in green, and invite students to do the same on their note-catchers. 

- Ask:

“Can you figure out why the author wrote But?” (But connects this sentence to the previous one, and signals that the idea in this sentence will add something different, or will seem surprising, after the idea presented in the previous sentence.)

- Invite students to take 30 seconds in pairs to discuss the idea presented in the previous sentence (*He knew his ideas would be laughed at*) and then to predict what different, or seemingly surprising, idea might be presented in this sentence. (*Responses will vary, but may include that Snow wanted to pursue his ideas anyway, even though people would laugh at him*.)

he didn’t forget about them

Deconstruct

- Ask:

“To whom does he refer in this chunk?” (John Snow; we know because the previous two sentences were about John Snow.)

“What does this chunk tell us about Snow?” (He didn’t forget about them; he made sure to remember them.)

“To whom or what does them refer in this chunk?” (them refers to Snow’s ideas. We know because of the previous sentence in the book: “He knew his ideas would be laughed at.” John Snow didn’t want to forget about his ideas.)

- Invite students to take 30 seconds in pairs to discuss what Snow’s ideas were. Encourage them to reference the previous paragraph in *Patient Zero* to do so. (*Responses will vary, but may include: Snow had an idea that something in food and water caused cholera; that people were passing cholera from one to another through feces they were unknowingly ingesting*.)

—he waited for an opportunity

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **—he waited for an opportunity**

- Ask:

“Can you figure out why this chunk starts with a dash?” (The dash is called an em dash and is sometimes used in place of a comma, parentheses, or a colon. The em dash is used in this chunk to emphasize the information that comes after the dash.)

“What does this chunk tell us?” (That Snow waited for an opportunity. To wait for something means to expect or hope that something will happen; that hasn’t happened yet. Note that the phrase wait for means something different from the word wait, which means to stay somewhere or not do something until something else happens.)

“What is an opportunity?” (a set of circumstances that makes it possible to do something that is likely to have a positive outcome)

- Invite students to discuss in pairs a time in their own lives when they waited for an opportunity to do something. Then, invite students to consider the first two chunks of this sentence  
  (**But** + **he didn’t forget about** \[his ideas\]) and to predict what opportunity they think Snow waited for. (*Responses will vary, but may include: a chance to show the world his ideas were valid*.)

to prove his theory.

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **to prove his theory**.

- Ask:

“What does the infinitive verb to prove tell us about the opportunity that John Snow had?” (It tells us what the opportunity was that Snow waited for. It lets us know he waited for a set of circumstances that made it possible for him to prove something.)

“What does it mean to prove something?” (To prove means to provide facts or information about something to show that it is true.)

“What did Snow want to prove?” (His theory; a theory is a set of ideas intended to explain something, especially something that has not already been shown to be true.)

“What was Snow’s theory?” (Snow’s theory corresponds with his ideas referenced in the second chunk—that something in food and water caused cholera; that people were passing cholera from one to another through feces they were unknowingly ingesting.)

“Why did Snow have to prove his theory?” (His theory, or ideas, deviated from the medical thinking of the day; “that cholera was caused by ‘miasma,’ a fog of infected air rising from piles of garbage and sewage” \[41\].)

- If productive, cue students to expand the conversation:

“Can you say more about that?” (Responses will vary.)

- Invite students to take 30 seconds in pairs to discuss how they thought Snow would prove his theory. (*Responses will vary, but may include: Snow did everything possible to gather evidence confirming his ideas to be true*.)

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Display the sentence frame:

> I had an opportunity \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
>
> (**to** + base form of verb + noun phrase)

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use this frame to talk with your partners about a time when you had an opportunity to do something.”

But he didn’t forget about them—he waited for an opportunity to prove his theory.

Reconstruct

- Point to and read aloud the entire sentence on display: **But he didn’t forget about them—he waited for an opportunity to prove his theory**.

- Ask:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“What does this sentence demonstrate about John Snow’s habits of character?” (His perseverance and initiative as he tried to solve the cholera mystery; he didn’t give up, even when others did not take him seriously.)

“How does this sentence help address the daily learning target: ‘I can explain how sections of Patient Zero contribute to the whole chapter’?” (The sentence shows Snow’s commitment to proving that, contrary to the medical thinking of the day, cholera was not caused by miasma.)

- If productive, use a Goal 2 Conversation Cue to encourage students to listen carefully and seek to understand:

“Who can tell us what your classmate said in your own words?” (Responses will vary.)

- Ask:

“What other questions can we ask that will help us understand this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question: ‘What is the role of character and mindset in solving epidemic crises?’” (Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

> But Snow \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_—he waited for an opportunity \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
>
> predicate infinitive phrase
>
> (But Snow + \[predicate\] + —he waited for an opportunity + \[infinitive phrase\].)

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners. Say:

“Use this frame to talk with your partners, in your own words, about Snow’s commitment to proving his theory.”

- If productive, cue students to elaborate and expand the conversation:

“Can you say more about that?” (Responses will vary.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- Congratulate students on completing the Language Dive to better understand the meaning of these sentences, how they connect to the guiding question, and how to use such sentences in their own speaking and writing.

- Tell students that posting the chunks in language categories will help them use the language again for future speaking and writing tasks.

- Say the following, then call on volunteers:

“Now take each chunk and post it to the appropriate section of the Language Chunk Wall. You can refer to these chunks again as you speak and write.”
