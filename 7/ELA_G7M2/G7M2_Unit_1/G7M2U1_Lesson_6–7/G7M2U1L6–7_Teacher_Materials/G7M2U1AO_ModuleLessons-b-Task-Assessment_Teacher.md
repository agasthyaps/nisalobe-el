Complete the chart to break up the word **inconsistencies** into a prefix, Latin root, and suffix. You may use your Affix List as a resource. (L.7.4b)

|            |            |                                 |
|------------|------------|---------------------------------|
|            | Word Part  | Meaning                         |
| **Prefix** | in-        | not                             |
| **Root**   | consistent | adhering to the same principles |
| **Suffix** | -cies      | noun form                       |

18. Use what you know about these word parts to write a definition of the word **inconsistencies** in your own words. (RI.7.4, L.7.6)

Inconsistencies means things that don’t hold together or make sense together.

**Directions:** Use the text to answer these questions about how Marilee Peters structures sections of chapter 2 in *Patient Zero* and how these sections relate to the whole text and develop ideas.

19. How is the section “The Great Debate: Miasma vs. Germs” on page 41 mainly structured? (RI.7.5)

20. by narrating stories about scientists in chronological order

21. <u>as an explanation of the history of ideas about the causes of disease</u>

22. as a list of definitions focused on specific diseases caused by germs or miasma

23. by contrasting John Snow’s and Florence Nightingale’s views of miasmas and germs

24. How is the rest of the excerpt about John Snow on pages 38–40 mainly structured? (RI.7.5)

25. as an argument about why Snow began studying medicine

26. as an examination of vocabulary that may be unfamiliar to readers

27. as a detailed description of the setting where the major events happen

28. <u>as a presentation of Snow’s argument that miasma did not cause disease</u>

29. What key information does “The Great Debate: Miasma vs. Germs” provide? (RI.7.1, RI.7.5)

30. Cholera was the first disease caused by germs.

31. <u>Miasma was a long-lasting and widely accepted idea.</u>

32. Florence Nightingale’s beliefs prevented her from being helpful.

33. Robert Koch was the one who got credit for discovering germs.

34. **  
    **How does the information in this section contribute to your understanding of the rest of the text on pages 38–40? (RI.7.5)

    1.  by showing how John Snow first developed his ideas that led to innovations

    2.  by showing how understanding where words come from can help in science

    3.  <u>by providing an explanation for why Snow’s theory of germs was remarkable</u>

    4.  by providing information about why London was the perfect place to investigate

35. How does the section of *Patient Zero* called “The Great Debate: Miasma vs. Germs” (41) add to the description of John Snow’s investigation (38–40) and our understanding of the significance of his ideas? Write a paragraph in which you use at least two specific pieces of evidence from the text to support your answer.

Responses will vary. Sample response:

The section “The Great Debate: Miasma vs. Germs” tells us more about the history of the idea of miasma. It defines miasma as a kind of bad air. It explains how doctors thought miasma caused diseases for most of history. This helps us to understand that John Snow’s idea about germs was so different. The description of Snow on the other pages explains how he came up with the idea of germs spreading disease. Then the section “The Great Debate: Miasma vs. Germs” helps us see how surprising these new ideas were. Even after his discovery, many still did not believe him. Peters writes, “Even after scientists like John Snow . . . proved that germs, not miasma, were the source of disease, many people refused to change their opinions” (41). The explanation of miasma on page 41 shows how unusual Snow was. His ideas were far ahead of his time.
