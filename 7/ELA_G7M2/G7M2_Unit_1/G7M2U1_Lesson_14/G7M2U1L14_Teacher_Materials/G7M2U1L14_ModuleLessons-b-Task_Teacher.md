> **Mary was released from North Brother Island when her case was heard by the New York State Supreme Court and health officials admitted that they had found “50 other healthy typhoid carriers” (83) but none of them were detained like Mary was. It is clear from the text on page 86 that people had a negative view of immigrants at the time. The text explains that immigrants were forced to live in cheap housing that had “no running water” or sanitation. This meant that diseases could spread more easily and so immigrants were blamed for the outbreaks. Whether it was fair to keep Mary in isolation so long depends on whether you think of her as a “villain” or a “victim.” People who look at Mary as a villain look at the idea that she was a healthy carrier and she knew that. They also see that she went out and started cooking for people anyway. The text says that she was found working in a hospital kitchen after she was released, “spreading typhoid germs among mothers and babies” (84). This decision by Mary makes the author ask, “Why did she risk going back to cooking after she’d finally won her freedom . . . ?” This is a good question. It seems like dangerous behavior.**

People can also look at certain events and ideas and see that Mary’s life was “ruined by an uncaring system” (84). First, the author explains that “she had very little power in the society in which she lived” (87). So, when someone came to tell her she was sick even when she didn’t feel sick, she might not have believed them. She may have thought they were just out to get her. Also, there was the fact that many other healthy carriers were identified and weren’t being punished. Therefore, it may have seemed like being a healthy carrier wasn’t as dangerous as others said. Finally, Mary also returned to being a cook because it was a better job than being a laundress. Plus, the health officials had not trained her to do anything else. As the author asks, “was it fair to keep Mary Mallon in isolation so long?” (87) Perhaps not.
