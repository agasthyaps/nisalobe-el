Grade 7: Module 2: Unit 1: Lesson 14

Lesson Overview

Lesson Summary

Students prepare for their text-based discussion by reviewing their note-catchers on interactions among individuals, events, and ideas in chapter 4 of *Patient Zero*. Then they participate in a text-based discussion about these interactions and how they impact our scientific and social ideas about disease. Students conclude the class with a sharing about their independent research reading texts.

Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- SL.7.1 – Opening A: Students review collaborative discussion norms and set goals for their own participation in the collaborative discussion.

- RI.7.10 – Closing and Assessment A: Students share about their independent research reading texts to hold them accountable for their reading homework. Consider using Independent Reading Sample Plans (see the Tools page: http://eled.org/tools) if not using other independent reading review routines.

- RI.7.3 – Work Time A: Students prepare for their collaborative discussion by reviewing their note-catchers about the interactions among the individuals, events, and ideas in chapter 4 of *Patient Zero*.

- RI.7.3 – Work Time B: Students analyze how the individuals, events, and ideas influence one another in chapter 4 of *Patient Zero*.

- SL.7.1d – Work Time B: Students engage in a collaborative discussion, especially acknowledging new information expressed by others and, when warranted, changing their own views.

- RI.7.10 – Closing and Assessment A: In a sharing activity, students demonstrate their ability to proficiently read and comprehend literary nonfiction in the Grades 6–8 text-complexity band over the course of the year.

- To hear all students discuss, choose one of the following two options:

- Fishbowl Discussion: Divide the class in half, and arrange one group in an outer circle and one group in an inner circle. The group in the inner circle discusses the prompt for 7 minutes, then the outer group moves to the middle to discuss the prompt for 7 minutes. (Allow time for switching groups.) While in the outer circle, students must listen and take notes, so that they can use the information from both discussions to help them with their analysis in Part II of the end of unit assessment in this lesson.

- Small Group Recorded Discussions: Create groups of about five students, and provide each group with a video recording device (a tablet or phone is sufficient). Students should know how to record using the device, and help each group place the camera in such a way so as to capture all students in the discussion. (Allow time for this setup.) Provide groups with 7 minutes for their discussion. Circulate to help with technical issues and to prompt with the follow-up discussion questions.

- In this lesson, the habit of character focus is on working to become effective learners and ethical people. The characteristics that students practice are respect, empathy, compassion, and taking initiative as they participate in a text-based discussion. They also practice integrity as they share about their independent research reading.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release more responsibility more quickly to students as they comprehend the tasks or concepts. For example:

- Encourage students to develop their own follow-up discussion questions during Work Time A to use during their discussions.

- If using the fishbowl format for discussion, consider allowing these students to be in the inner discussion circle first, so that they can model discussion norms and analysis for other students.

- Consider video-recording exemplary discussions so that students may learn in future classes or future years how to achieve mastery with text-based discussions.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students prepared for this discussion by reading pages 83–88 of *Patient Zero* and by completing the Solve *Patient Zero*, Chapter 4 note-catcher with evidence of how individuals, events, and ideas interact and influence one another.

Support All Students

- Note there is a differentiated version of the Discussion Prompts: *Patient Zero*, Pages 83–88 used in Work Time B in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Some students may require more support in preparing for a discussion. During Work Time A, encourage these students to use the Conversation Cues on the Discussion Norms anchor chart to draft questions and responses on their note-catchers. They can then read these as they participate in the discussion. ▲

- Also, if using the fishbowl format for discussion, consider placing students who need more support in the outer circle for the first round of discussion, so they can observe their peers and have more time to gather their thoughts. ▲

- In Closing and Assessment A, students share their independent research reading texts. Although they have only had a few homework assignments to read the text, some students may have read their texts when not assigned. Also, sharing this early in the reading emphasizes accountability of the reading and allows those students struggling to read or engage with their text to find a new text (perhaps one recommended by a classmate). Students will have more independent reading research opportunities in Units 2 and 3. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson includes some preparation time before the text-based discussion. Also, students have been prepared for the discussion with practice discussions across many lessons that followed a gradual release with strategic homogeneous and heterogeneous groupings as well as differing levels of preparatory support.

- ELLs may find may find it challenging to share about their independent research reading book, as they may not fully understand it or may be unaccustomed to expressing their opinions on assigned work. Make sure students understand the purpose of independent research reading. Emphasize the benefits of reading multiple texts on the same topic (e.g., repeated exposure to relevant vocabulary). Also, emphasize that sharing their opinions and thoughts about their reading can help them understand and enjoy their reading. As necessary, provide sentence starters for students to use when sharing. For example, “I like/don’t like this part of the book because . . . I found this part interesting because . . . ”

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, 7.I.B.6, 7.I.C.10, 7.I.C.12, and 7.II.C.6.

Assessment Guidance

- Although this is an informal assessment of discussion and analysis skills, consider using the Collaborative Discussion checklist (see Materials list) to give targeted feedback to improve future formal discussion assessments. Since it can be challenging to assess all students’ conversation and analysis skills during a fast-paced discussion, have the checklist prepared. Also, consider using a clipboard to enable circulating during the discussions. Finally, consider video-recording the discussions (even if using the whole-class fishbowl format) to enable multiple viewings and providing targeted feedback.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will begin to read articles about social epidemics and consider how they relate to medical epidemics.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – SL.7.1 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 14**. Students may or may not choose to share their goals for this assessment with a partner.

- Repeated routine: follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

- With students, use the vocabulary strategies on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart** to review the words *norms* (a model or standard that is generally followed), *text-based* (using or referring to a text or reading), and *discussion* (talking about something in a formal or serious way). Record on the **academic word wall** with translations in home languages, where appropriate, and invite students to record the words in their **vocabulary logs**.

Work Time

A. Prepare for a Text-Based Discussion – RI.7.3 (5 minutes)

- Remind students that they will conduct a text-based discussion, which means that they will talk formally about ***Patient Zero***, drawing on the text to support their statements. Ask students to retrieve their **Solve *Patient Zero***, **Chapter 4 note-catchers**. Distribute and display the **Discussion Prompts: *Patient Zero***, **Pages 83–88** and the **Discussion Prompts: *Patient Zero***, **Pages 83–88** ▲ as necessary. The differentiated note-catcher supports students in discussing and analyzing interactions among individuals, events, and ideas with sentence starters. ▲ Focus students’ attention on the discussion prompts, and remind them that they will use their note-catchers and *Patient Zero* text to respond to these questions in a discussion.

- Allow students about 3 minutes to review their note-catchers and use their *Patient Zero* texts to ensure they have all the evidence they need to support their responses to the discussion prompts.

- Refocus the class, and have students Turn and Talk to share one piece of new evidence they found to support their responses. As necessary, ask a volunteer to model using evidence from his or her note-catcher to make a statement using text evidence.

For Lighter Support

- If time allows, add 10 minutes to Work Time A and challenge students to review their note-catchers by acting out the flowchart. Assign students roles of “most people,” patient zero, investigators, and narrator. (Partner students at varied levels for roles, so students who need lighter support can model actions for their classmates who need heavier support.) The narrator reads from the flowchart while the other students act out the ideas, events, and individual actions. For example, the narrator might read, “Before the typhoid epidemic, most people did not understand the concept of germs.” The students playing the role of “most people” would pantomime spreading germs by pretending to cough into food and serving it to one another. Enacting the flowchart helps students and their classmates who need heavier support visualize the abstract interactions from the text.

- At the end of Work Time A, if students need the support in preparation for their collaborative discussion in Work Time B, distribute the Discussion Prompts: *Patient Zero*, Pages 83–88 handout, and challenge students to create sentence starters to answer each question. Remind students to also create sentence starters to give evidence that supports their responses. Creating sentence starters gives students confidence with language structures they can use in their discussions.

For Heavier Support

- If time allows, add 10 minutes to Work Time A and challenge students to review their note-catchers by acting out the flowchart. Assign students roles of “most people,” patient zero, investigators, and narrator. (Partner students at varied levels for roles, so students who need heavier support can follow and imitate the actions of their classmates who need lighter support.) The narrator reads from the flowchart while the other students act out the ideas, events, and individual actions. For example, the narrator might read, “Before the typhoid epidemic, most people did not understand the concept of germs.” The students playing the role of “most people” would pantomime spreading germs by pretending to cough into food and serving it to one another. Enacting the flowchart helps students and their classmates who need heavier support visualize the abstract interactions from the text.

- At the end of Work Time A, if students need the support in preparation for their collaborative discussion in Work Time B, distribute the Discussion Prompts: *Patient Zero*, Pages 83–88 handout ▲. This resource includes sentence starters to support students in generating language during a discussion. Allow time for students to complete the sentence starters in writing and orally rehearse their statements with a partner. Writing down and practicing sentences they can use in a discussion gives students confidence to increase their successful participation.

Work Time

B. Text-Based Discussion – RI.7.3, SL.7.1d (20 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can quote accurately from the text to support my ideas during a text-based discussion.”

“I can acknowledge new information expressed by others and, when necessary, modify my own views.”

“I can analyze how individuals, ideas, and events influence one another.”

- Direct students to form the predetermined groups and organize themselves into either the fishbowl or small group discussion format. Remind students to show respect, empathy, and compassion as they follow the classroom rules for collegial discussion. They will also take initiative as they participate in a discussion. Refer to the **Work to Become Ethical People** and **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor charts** as necessary to review respect, empathy, compassion, and taking initiative.

- Remind students to use the following materials during their discussion:

- Solve *Patient Zero* Chapter 4 note-catchers (pages 72–78)

- Discussion Prompts: *Patient Zero*, Pages 83–88

- **Discussion Norms anchor chart**

- **Quote Accurately from the Text handout**

- Invite students to begin the discussion. Circulate to make informal assessments on the **Collaborative Discussion checklist (for teacher reference)** if desired and to prompt students with the questions on **Discussion Prompts: *Patient Zero***, **Pages 83–88 (example for teacher reference)**.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- For students who do not need as much support at this point, just distribute the Discussion Prompts: *Patient Zero*, Pages 83–88 handout ▲ during Work Time B. This resource includes sentence starters to support students in generating language during a discussion.

Closing and Assessment

A. Independent Research Reading Share – RI.7.10 (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to guide students to share their independent research reading, reminding students that the purpose of research reading is to build their content knowledge, domain-specific vocabulary, and achievement on reading complex texts. As necessary, use the Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart to review integrity.

- Refer to the **Independent Reading Sample Plans** (see the Tools page: http://eled.org/tools) to guide students through a research reading share, or use another routine.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.

For Lighter Support

- Provide students with copies of the “Kindness Contagion” article they will read in class in Unit 2, Lesson 1. Encourage students to read the article for homework, using strategies to define unknown words and recording gists after each paragraph to confirm comprehension.

For Heavier Support

- Provide students with the differentiated copies of the “Kindness Contagion” article ▲ they will read in class in Unit 2, Lesson 1. The differentiated copy includes gists at the end of each paragraph to support students’ comprehension of the complex text. Encourage students to read the article for homework, using strategies to define unknown words and reading the gists to ensure comprehension.
