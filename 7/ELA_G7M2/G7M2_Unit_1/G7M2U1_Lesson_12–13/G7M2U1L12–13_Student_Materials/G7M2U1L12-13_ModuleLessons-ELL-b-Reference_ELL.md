**“Round Three”**

- Mary Mallon pleaded to be released from quarantine.

- She won her freedom as long as she agreed not to work as a cook again.

- The health department didn’t train her for new work. Instead, they gave her a job as a laundress, which was one of the worst-paid jobs for a woman.

- In 1915, a maternity hospital had an outbreak of typhoid.

- George Soper and Dr. Josephine Baker found that it was Mary spreading the germs.

- Mary was sent back to North Brother Island, where she stayed for the next twenty-three years.

- Mary died in quarantine.

**“Villain or Victim?”**

- The newspapers called her “Typhoid Mary.”

- Still today, we call people who spread disease a Typhoid Mary.

- Why did she go back to cooking after she won her freedom?

- Was she a villain? Or was she a victim of an uncaring system?

- Because Mary was an Irish immigrant and was unmarried with very little education, she had very little power.

- Her standing up for herself may have made doctors and officials think she was a problem.

- How far should governments go when trying to protect people from epidemics?

“Tool of the Trade: Quarantine**”

- Quarantines have been used for centuries to contain epidemics.

- The word **quarantine** comes from the Italian word for forty days—*quaranta giorni*—because during the plague pandemic of the 1300s that’s how long the city of Venice made ships wait in the harbor before docking, in order to be sure no one on board had plague.

- If people thought a quarantine was coming, they would escape, which would spread disease further.

- We still use quarantine today.

- In 2020, many countries began requiring people returning from other places to self-quarantine for at least two weeks.

**“The Irish Potato Epidemic”**

- Mary Mallon was one of many Irish people who came to North America in the 1800s and early 1900s because of the potato epidemic.

- Potatoes, which were farmers’ main source of food, became infected with a mold.

- A million people starved to death.

- In New York, landlords rented out cheap, unsanitary apartments to the new arrivals.

- Diseases spread quickly, but no one blamed the landlords. They blamed the Irish people.

- Mary confirmed to people that immigrants were the sources of disease.

- All pathogens need is a human body, regardless of race, belief, or sexuality.

**“A Vaccine and a World War”**

- In 1911, a British scientist called Almroth Wright developed a vaccine for the disease.

- The vaccine was mandatory for all soldiers in the US Army during World War I.

- The results were impressive.

**  
“The Future of Typhoid”**

- In most of North America and Europe, typhoid is a disease of the “bad old days” before sewers and running water.

- Typhoid is still around in other parts of the world.

- The World Health Organization estimates that between eleven and twenty-one million people get sick with typhoid every year, and up to 161,000 of them—mostly children—die from the disease.

- At least one in six people is asymptomatic (no symptoms).

- The cost of introducing a vaccination program is very high.

- The bacteria that causes typhoid is mutating, producing new strains of typhoid that are resistant to antibiotics.

- In 2016, an outbreak of drug-resistant typhoid emerged in Pakistan, and by 2019 it had infected 11,000 people and caused over one hundred deaths.
