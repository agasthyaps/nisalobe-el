22. It is time for you to be the detective. Using several pieces of the evidence you identified in item 5 above, write a brief response that explains how the ideas, events, and actions of individuals interacted in the text to support <u>either</u> the view that Mary was a “villain” or that Mary’s life “was ruined by an uncaring system.” Be sure to use evidence from the text, and explain how these events and ideas interact to support your view. (RI.7.3)

Possible Responses:

It is true that people can look at Mary in different ways. Some people might call her a villain. They look at the idea that she was a healthy carrier and she knew this. They also see that she went out and started cooking for people anyway. The text says that she was found working in a hospital kitchen after she was released, “spreading typhoid germs among mothers and babies and doctors and nurses” (84). This decision by Mary makes the author ask, “Why did she risk going back to cooking after she’d finally won her freedom . . .?” This is a good question. It seems like dangerous behavior.

OR

People can look at certain events and ideas and see that Mary is being treated unfairly. First, the author explains that “she had very little power in the society in which she lived” (87). So when someone came to tell her she was sick even when she didn’t feel sick, she might not have believed them. She may have thought they were just out to get her. Also, there was the fact that many other “healthy carriers” were identified and weren’t being punished. Therefore, it may have seemed like being a healthy carrier wasn’t as dangerous as others said. Finally, Mary also returned to being a cook because it was a better job than being a laundress. Plus the health officials had not trained her to do anything else. Was it fair to keep Mary Mallon in isolation so long? Perhaps not.
