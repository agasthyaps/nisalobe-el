<p>One of the investigators was George Soper. To investigate the epidemic he investigated the home and found no cause. He was told of Mary making dessert, and finally found and confronted Mary.</p>
<p>Another investigator was Dr. Josephine Baker. To investigate the epidemic she tracked down Mary and tested her, leading to her quarantine.</p>
<p>(Habits of Character):</p>
<p>The first investigator showed perseverance and initiative when he persisted and dug more deeply even when the solution was not obvious.</p>
<p>The second investigator showed perseverance when she tracked down Mary. She also showed a sense of belonging in the community as she struggled “against the odds” as a female doctor at the time.</p></td>
