Epidemics

Grade 7: Module 2: Unit 1: Lessons 12–13

Lesson Overview

Lesson Summary

Students read pages 83–88 of *Patient Zero*, determining the gist and noting new vocabulary. Then they independently analyze the interaction of individuals, events, and ideas in the text, completing a note-catcher. Next, students complete their end of unit assessment by answering selected and constructed response questions about how the interaction of individuals, events, and ideas impact our scientific and social ideas about disease. They conclude the class by tracking their progress on reading and analyzing new text.

Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.7.3 – Work Time A: Students read a new excerpt from *Patient Zero* and independently complete a note-catcher to analyze how individuals, events, and ideas interact in the excerpt.

- RI.7.4 – Closing and Assessment A: Students track progress on their ability to read and analyze text and use strategies to determine the meanings of words and phrases as they are used in the text.

- For the end of unit assessment in Work Time B of this lesson, students complete selected and constructed response questions to analyze how the individuals, events, and ideas interact and influence one another in chapter 4 of *Patient Zero* as well as how Peters’ word choice develops meaning and tone. (RI.7.1, RI.7.3, RI.7.4, RI.7.10, L.7.6)

- The Think-Pair-Share protocol is used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- In this lesson, the habit of character focus is on working to become effective learners and ethical people. The characteristics that students practice are integrity and perseverance as they work independently on assessments and taking responsibility as they assess their own work by tracking their progress on Reading standards.

- Also, in the excerpt of *Patient Zero* read in this lesson, Mary Mallon demonstrates perseverance and initiative as she writes letters, protesting that her civil rights have been ignored. In an effort to get released from quarantine and fight her case in court, she also demonstrates the academic mindset of “I can succeed at this.”

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- If students complete their assessments before the allotted time, they should review their responses, especially to the constructed response prompt, checking for spelling, capitalization, and punctuation. They may also have time and desire to expand their response to more than one paragraph.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students have focused on investigating how the individuals, events, and ideas interacted in the text. They are now independent with this work and doing so without support.

Support All Students

- Note there is a Synopsis: *Patient Zero*, Pages 83–88 ▲ and a differentiated version of the Solve *Patient Zero*, Chapter 4 note-catcher (begun in Lesson 10) used in Work Time A in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment. ▲

- Some students may require more than the time allotted to complete the assessment. ▲

- To support ELLs, the assessment in this lesson consists of tasks and questions in the same format as the note-catchers students have used throughout the unit thus far. This gradual release supports students in independent achievement on this assessment.

- ELLs may find it challenging to write a constructed response independently, even with all the practice on similar tasks throughout the unit. Remind students that they have successfully completed similar activities in class, and encourage them to do their best. Help students be mindful of the amount of time they spend on each task.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, 7.I.B.6, 7.I.B.7, 7.I.B.8, 7.I.C.10, 7.I.C.12, and 7.II.A.1.

Assessment Guidance

- All assessment materials (student prompt, answer key and sample student responses) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback on this assessment, use the answer key and sample student responses to help complete students’ Track Progress recording forms.

- In this assessment, students are tracking progress toward anchor standards:

- R.1: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.

- R.4: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Interpret words and phrases as they are used in a text, including determining technical, connotative, and figurative meanings, and analyze how specific word choices shape meaning or tone.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a text-based discussion about how the individuals, events, and ideas interact and influence one another.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Return students’ **Mid-Unit 1 Assessments with feedback**, and allow students time to review feedback and write their name on the board if they require support.

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lessons 12–13**. Students may or may not choose to share their goals for this assessment with a partner.

- Repeated routine: follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read and Analyze Individuals, Events, and Ideas: *Patient Zero*, Pages 83–88 – RI.7.3 (35 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify key individuals, events, and ideas in a text.”

“I can analyze how individuals, events, and ideas interact with one another.”

- Repeated routine: Follow a similar process as with previous lessons for students to read pages 83–88 of ***Patient Zero***. Then have students record the overall gist on **sticky notes**. Explain that, since they will be using this excerpt later, as part of an assessment, they should complete this reading independently. However, if necessary, direct students to the **Synopsis: *Patient Zero***, **Pages 83–88** ▲ to support their comprehension of the excerpt.

- Gist: Mary Mallon freed, returned to quarantine.

- Ask students to retrieve their **Solve *Patient Zero***, **Chapter 4 note-catchers** and the **Solve *Patient Zero***, **Chapter 4 note-catcher** ▲ as necessary. The differentiated note-catcher supports students in analyzing interactions among individuals, events, and ideas with sentence starters. ▲ Instruct students to complete their note-catcher independently with new events, individuals’ actions, and ideas from the excerpt from *Patient Zero* that they just read. Circulate and support students, using the **Solve *Patient Zero***, **Chapter 4 (Pages 83–88) note-catcher (for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- At the end of Work Time A, ensure students understand the excerpt they read by allowing time for them to share with a partner who may need heavier support to review their highlights and illustrations on the Synopsis: *Patient Zero*, Pages 83–88 from the previous lesson’s homework.

For Heavier Support

- At the end of Work Time A, ensure students understand the excerpt they read by allowing time for them to share with a partner who may need lighter support to review their highlights and illustrations on the Synopsis: *Patient Zero*, Pages 83–88 from the previous lesson’s homework.

Work Time

B. End of Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Individuals, Events, and Ideas: *Patient Zero*, Chapter 4 (35 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze the impact of a specific word choice on meaning and tone.”

“I can identify key individuals, events, and ideas in a text.”

“I can analyze how individuals, ideas, and events influence one another.”

- Remind students to use strategies to determine meanings of unfamiliar words and phrases as they complete selected response questions. Then they will complete selected and constructed response questions to analyze how the individuals, ideas, and events interact in the text.

- Read aloud the directions for each part of the **End of Unit 1 Assessment** as students follow along, reading silently. Answer clarifying questions.

- Before students begin the assessment, ask them to Think-Pair-Share:

“What value does the task of a reading assessment have for you beyond this class? Why?” (Responses will vary, but may include: this task has a lot of value for me because I will have to take assessments in most of my high school and college classes and in most careers.)

“What will help you succeed on this assessment?” (Responses will vary, but may include: using my strategies to answer selected response questions and writing a paragraph with a topic sentence, at least two pieces of evidence, and a concluding statement will help me succeed on this task.)

- Direct students’ attention to the following materials:

- **Academic word wall** and **domain-specific word wall**

- **Strategies to Answer Selected Response Questions anchor chart**

- Solve *Patient Zero*, Chapter 4 note-catcher

- Remind students to refer to these anchor charts as they read the assessment text and answer the assessment questions.

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence. As necessary, review integrity, perseverance, and the **Work to Become Ethical People** and **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor charts**. Remind students that because they will be reading and answering questions independently for the assessment, they will need to practice these habits.

- Invite students to begin the assessment.

- While they are taking the assessment, circulate to monitor and document their test-taking skills.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- Before the end of unit assessment in Work Time B, challenge students to underline key vocabulary in the assessment directions and prompt as you read them aloud together as a class. Also, invite students who need lighter support to restate or clarify information for students who need heavier support. These supports ensure that students understand each task included in the assessment.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time B, read the directions for the assessment aloud slowly, twice, and also post them. This ensures that ELLs who may not be able to easily follow the language of the directions have multiple opportunities to access them.

- Display a “map” of the assessment to reference while explaining directions to the end of unit assessment. This will reduce ambiguity and give students a clearer picture of what they can expect so that they can better allocate their time and attentional resources. Provide students with colored pencils or highlighters so that they can mark up the “map” as needed. Example:

- Part I:

- Read the question.

- Read each possible answer.

- Cross out incorrect answers.

- Select the best answer to the question.

- Repeat steps 1–4 for questions 1–4.

- For item 5, rewrite the ideas, events, or individual actions from the list at the top in the correct boxes below.

- Read the prompt for question 6.

- Write a paragraph with:

1.  a topic sentence that restates and answers the prompt.

2.  two pieces of evidence (quotes or examples) from the text.

3.  sentences that explain how the evidence supports your answer.

4.  a concluding sentence that restates and answers the prompt.

- To help students manage their time during the mid-unit assessment, display on the board or on a poster suggested times at which students move on to the next question. Allocate the most time to item 6, the constructed response.

Closing and Assessment

A. Track Progress – RI.7.4 (15 minutes)

- Give students specific positive feedback on their completion of the End of Unit 1 Assessment. (Example: “I saw a lot of you using evidence to support analysis in your constructed responses.”)

- Distribute the **Track Progress folders**, **Track Progress: Read, Understand, and Explain New Text**, and sticky notes. Tell students that successful learners keep track of and reflect on their own learning and that they will complete a form like this after most of their assessments this year. Remind them that they did this after previous mid-unit assessments.

- Tell students the sticky notes are for them to find evidence of the following criteria:

- RI.7.1

- RI.7.4

- Allow students to orally paraphrase the meaning of the Track Progress criteria, self-assess, and discuss the evidence with a partner before they begin writing. Guide students through completing the form.

- Have students place the form in their Track Progress folders, and collect students’ folders.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.

For Lighter Support

- Allow time at the end of class for students to share with a partner the independent research reading book they chose in Lesson 3 and why they chose it. Reviewing their book choice will ensure students are engaged with their book and give them an opportunity to find a different one if they are no longer interested in their choice.

For Heavier Support

- Allow time at the end of class for students to share with a partner the independent research reading book they chose in Lesson 3 and why they chose it. Reviewing their book choice will ensure students are engaged with their book and give them an opportunity to find a different one if they are no longer interested in their choice. Also, as necessary, review the purpose of independent research reading. Emphasize the benefits of reading multiple texts on the same topic (e.g., repeated exposure to relevant vocabulary).
