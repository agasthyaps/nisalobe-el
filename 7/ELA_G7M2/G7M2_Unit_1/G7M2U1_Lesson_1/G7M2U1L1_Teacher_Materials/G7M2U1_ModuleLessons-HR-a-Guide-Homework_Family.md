![](media/image1.png) Guiding Questions and Big Ideas

What are epidemics? How do they develop?

- *Epidemics can be medical or social. There are similarities and differences to epidemics, depending on whether they are social or medical in nature.*

- *Social epidemics can be positive or negative.*

- *Epidemics spread through contagion as well as social networks.*

How do people respond to an epidemic?

- *People’s response to epidemics affects their overall impact. When people respond with positive character traits and logic, epidemics can be contained. When people respond with fear and selfishness, epidemics often spread.*

What is the role of character and mindset in solving epidemic crises?

- *Epidemiologists can respond to epidemics with integrity, initiative, responsibility, and perseverance. Doctors or caregivers can respond to patients with compassion, respect, and empathy.*

What methods and tools help people to solve epidemics?

- *People use logic, the scientific method, and innovation to solve mysterious epidemics.*

What will your student be doing at school?

Students begin Unit 1 by reading three chapters from the anchor text, *Patient Zero*[^1], examining examples of epidemics in the seventeenth to the early twentieth centuries. In the first half of the unit, students explore the wide variety of text features and structures incorporated into each chapter of *Patient Zero*, such as side bars, images, and text boxes. Also, students analyze how major sections contribute to the whole text and the development of ideas. Students also practice determining the meanings of words and phrases, especially technical terms associated with epidemiology.

In the second half of the unit, students focus more on the interactions among the individual epidemiologists or scientists, the events during the epidemics, and the ideas about disease at the time. Students also consider the mindsets, tools, and character traits that enabled the scientists to solve these medical mysteries. Finally, students practice determining the impact of word choice on the meaning and tone of the text.

Central to the EL Education curriculum is a focus on “habits of character” and social-emotional learning. Students work to become effective learners, developing mindsets and skills for success in college, career, and life (e.g., initiative, responsibility, perseverance, collaboration); work to become ethical people, treating others well and standing up for what is right (e.g., empathy, integrity, respect, compassion); and work to contribute to a better world, putting their learning to use to improve communities (e.g., citizenship, service).

Please note that students do not read about the COVID-19 pandemic in this unit; however,

there are references to this pandemic in some of the chapters of *Patient Zero*. Students are

given opportunities to share and discuss their experiences of epidemics.

In this unit, as students read *Patient Zero*, they witness scientists, doctors, and ordinary citizens demonstrating the following habits of character—respect, empathy, collaboration, initiative, responsibility, perseverance, citizenship, and service—as they solve medical mysteries and take care of the sick. Additionally, students focus on respect, empathy, and compassion as they respond to one another’s ideas and skills in written work and in discussions. Students also practice collaboration and taking initiative during discussions. They practice integrity and perseverance as they work independently on assessments. And they take responsibility for their own learning as they track progress on their assessments.

How can you support your student at home?

Talk with your student about epidemics or diseases and how people research and react to the epidemics and the patients.

Read books and articles with your student, and discuss text features and structures incorporated into the book (such as sidebars, images, charts, and other graphic or text elements). Also, discuss how the major sections of the text contribute to the whole text and to the development of ideas. Finally, focus on the interactions among the individuals (their thoughts, actions, mindsets, character traits), the events of the epidemics, and the ideas people have about disease and patients.

You may use questions such as the following for your conversations:

- What text features or sections are in this text? How does this section relate to the main section?

- What information does it give us? How does this information relate to the information in the main section?

- Who are the key people involved in this epidemic (scientists, health officials, patients, government officials)? What are their mindsets and character traits? What do they do in reaction to the epidemic?

- How does the epidemic develop? What are the main events? How do the individuals respond to these events?

- What ideas about the epidemic do people have? What ideas about patients or people with the disease do people have? How do the key individuals respond to or use these ideas?

Unit 1: Homework

In Lesson 1, students read the module guiding questions (listed above) and discuss them with a family member, talking about how the questions make them feel and why, and what the questions make them think about. Students can sketch or write their reflections.

In Lessons 1–11, students preread excerpts from *Patient Zero* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.

In Lessons 2–7, students use context and, if necessary, a dictionary to determine the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary in excerpts from *Patient Zero*.

In Lessons 8–11, students respond to constructed response and selected response questions to prepare for the end of unit assessment.

In Lessons 12–14, homework focuses on research reading for which students read a topic-related book of choice and answer a question related to the unit’s ideas and skills.

Research Reading: When not reading their anchor text, your student is expected to independently research the topic by reading topic-related books of his or her choice for approximately 20 minutes each day and responding to a prompt of choice in the front of the independent reading journal. These are usually books your student will bring home from school; however, they may be topic-related books chosen by the student at the public or your home library. Prompts for independent reading can be found in the homework materials provided below.

Independent Reading

**Directions:** Remember to record responses to research reading in the front of your independent reading journal and responses to choice reading in the back. Try to choose a different prompt each time.

Record any new vocabulary in your vocabulary log. Underline vocabulary found during independent reading.

Record:

- Date

- Title and author of your reading book

- Pages you have read

- Prompt

- Response

Example:

<u>Date</u>: 01/30/19

<u>Book Title and Author</u>: *Patient Zero* by Marilee Peters

<u>Pages Read</u>: 9–14 and 17

<u>Prompt</u>: What text features or sections are in this text? How does this section relate to the main section?

<u>Response</u>: There are white pages that tell a story about Goodwoman Phillips and red pages that give more information about the time period, disease, important events, etc. The red pages relate to the white pages by giving more information about the people, events, and ideas mentioned in the white pages.

Consider using the following independent reading prompts.[^2]

- What text features or sections are in this text? How does this section relate to the main section?

- What information does this section give us? How does this information relate to the information in the main section?

- Who are the key people involved in this epidemic (scientists, health officials, patients, government officials)? What are their mindsets and character traits? What do they do in reaction to the epidemic?

- How does the epidemic develop? What are the main events? How do the individuals respond to these events?

- What ideas about the epidemic do people have? What ideas about patients or people with the disease do people have? How do the key individuals respond to or use these ideas?

- Choose one new word from your reading today, and analyze it on a vocabulary square.

|                                               |                                        |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Definition in your own words                  | Synonyms (words with the same meaning) |
| Words with the same affix or root             | Sketch                                 |
| Translation in home language (if appropriate) |                                        |

Vocabulary

**Directions:** In the classroom, you have been recording words from your texts in your vocabulary log. Throughout this unit, you have been research reading topic-related books at home to build your knowledge of epidemics and recording words in your independent reading journal.

Choose a word from your research reading or from a text you’ve read in class, and add the word to your vocabulary log. Try to choose a different word to add and to practice a different vocabulary strategy each time. For each word, be sure to add the following:

1.  The definition, or meaning, of the word

<!-- -->

3.  The vocabulary strategy you used to figure out the meaning of the word

4.  A sketch or diagram that helps you to better understand the meaning of the word

Record new vocabulary in vocabulary logs and mark academic vocabulary with a symbol—for example, a star:

- Academic vocabulary: Words you might find in informational texts on many different topics. For example, the words *evidence* and *rationale* are words that could be found in books on any topic.

- Domain-specific vocabulary: Words about a particular topic. For example, the words *tadpoles*, *frogspawn*, and *amphibian* are some that would be found on the topic of frogs.

Vocabulary Strategies

As a reminder, the vocabulary strategies we’ve been working on in class are:

- Context: read the sentence around the word.

- Look at the affixes for clues.

- Look at the root of the word for clues.

- Use a dictionary.

- Discuss the word with another person (after attempting some of the above strategies).

[^1]: *Patient Zero* contains references to sensitive topics such as disease and death as well as the conditions that contribute to disease. These issues must be carefully and sensitively discussed to give students context as they read the story. Consider speaking with students and families in advance, especially those who may have sensitivity to topics discussed.

[^2]: Some of the prompts will not be appropriate for the text students are reading. Invite students to choose a prompt that works for the text they have just read.
