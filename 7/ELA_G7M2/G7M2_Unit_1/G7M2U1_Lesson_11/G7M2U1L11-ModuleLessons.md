Grade 7: Module 2: Unit 1: Lesson 11

Lesson Overview

Lesson Summary

Students read pages 79–83 of *Patient Zero*, determining the gist and noting new vocabulary. Then they continue analyzing the interaction of individuals, events, and ideas in the text and create an interactive flowchart to demonstrate these interactions. Students conclude the class by discussing their ideas about these interactions and how they impact our scientific and social ideas about disease.

Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.7.3 – Opening A: Students provide feedback to their peers on their writing of constructed responses and their analysis of how individuals, events, and ideas interact.

- RI.7.3 – Work Time B: Students analyze the interaction among individuals, events, and ideas.

- RI.7.3 – Closing and Assessment A: Students assess their ability to analyze the interaction among individuals, events, and ideas.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners by collaborating with peers.

- Students engage in the Think-Pair-Shareprotocol in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- Students also engage in the following collaborative activity:

- **Interactive Flowchart**: An organized collection of words and phrases that students manipulate in order to spark discussion and make connections. An Interactive Flowchart in a classroom is a powerful instructional tool: it makes words, facts, and ideas visible, easily referenced and manipulated, supports the teaching of key words and concepts, and encourages students to make connections while reading and reflecting on a text or texts.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release more responsibility more quickly to students as they comprehend the tasks or concepts. For example:

- Allow those students who are identifying individuals, events, and ideas, quickly the opportunity to develop their own text-dependent questions about the chapter related to interactions of these elements. Ask these students to share their questions with the group as a way of generating discussion. (RI.7.3)

- Have students debate which particular concept (individual, event, or idea) is emphasized in this excerpt. (RI.7.3) Additionally, the whole question of what should or should not have been done with Mary Mallon gets at questions of diversity and inclusion. Allow students to search for evidence of both why the quarantine of Mallon was justified and why it was not and then debate the bioethical dilemma. (SL.7.1)

- Have students research current bioethical dilemmas globally and analyze how events, individuals, and ideas interact in these events. (RI.7.3)

- An optional Mini Language Dive, intended for use after students read the text in Work Time A, is available in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students have focused on investigating how the individuals, events, and ideas interact in the text. In this lesson, students continue this work while grappling with the text’s focus on the social issues and ideas about human rights that influence how people respond to epidemics.

Support All Students

- At this point, students should be reading the text independently. However, if some or all students need more support, read several pages aloud and then release students to read independently, in pairs, or in small groups. ▲

- The subject matter in this excerpt includes descriptions of death and disease. Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this chapter that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually.

- Students may need additional support understanding the distinctions among individuals, events, and ideas in the text. Continue to work with students to point out specific examples in the text. Consider using examples from other texts or from history to aid students in understanding the concept. For example, how did the event of the invention of the computer change individuals’ lives? ▲

- Note there are differentiated versions of the Solve *Patient Zero*, Chapter 4 note-catcher—begun in Lesson 10 and used in Work Time A—and the Discussion Prompts: *Patient Zero*, Pages 79–83 handout, used in Closing and Assessment A. ▲

- Students may need additional support with the vocabulary of the Interactive Flowchart. Consider using illustrations or photographs on or next to particular words, to support learning with the aid of visual cues. Also, consider strategically grouping students by level so that they can comfortably participate in the activity as a rehearsal for the more challenging heterogeneous discussion in Closing and Assessment A. ▲

- For the discussion in Closing and Assessment A, consider grouping students into heterogeneous groups of four, containing a pair of students at one level and a pair of students at a different level, so that students will feel comfortable participating at their level but will also be challenged to participate in heterogeneous groups as they are required at the end of unit discussion. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson includes an interactive flowchart activity that is graphic, tactile, and collaborative, supporting students through multimodalities and by allowing them to review and rehearse their analysis before a more formal class discussion.

- ELLs may find it challenging to participate in the collaborative discussions in Closing and Assessment A, as the recommendation is to make the groups more heterogeneous, a mix of different levels. Take time to assure students that the discussion is not assessed and that they should challenge themselves to make at least three contributions to the group discussion. Also, the strategic grouping in the interactive flowchart activity and the supports below will enable students to feel more comfortable participating in the discussion.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, 7.I.B.6, 7.I.C.10, 7.I.C.12, and 7.II.C.6.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ constructed response homework assignments and Solve *Patient Zero*, Chapter 4 note-catchers to ensure they understand how individuals, events, and ideas interact.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue to analyze *Patient Zero* for the interaction among individuals, ideas, and events. They will read a new excerpt from the text and fill in the note-catcher independently. Then they will complete their end of unit assessment, responding to selected and constructed response questions to analyze how individuals, events, and ideas interact and influence one another in the excerpt.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.7.3 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 11**.

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, have partners share students’ strengths and learning opportunities with one another. Consider sharing strengths and learning opportunities as a total participation technique or having volunteers share their own personal strengths and learning opportunities, as discussed with their partner.

- Repeated routine: follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read *Patient Zero*, Pages 79–83 (15 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify key individuals, events, and ideas in a text.”

- Repeated routine: Follow the same process as with previous lessons for students to read pages 79–83 of ***Patient Zero***, using the **Text Guide: *Patient Zero*** **(for teacher reference)** as necessary. If students do not finish reading the excerpt within the allotted time, use the **Synopsis**: ***Patient Zero***, **Pages 79–83** document to review the key details from the excerpt. Then have students identify the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary, reflect on their reading as they choose, and record the overall gist on **sticky notes** using the following resources as appropriate: **vocabulary logs**, **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**, and **Questions about Epidemics anchor chart**.

- Gist: Mary Mallon quarantined.

- Once students have finished reading and reflecting on the excerpt, ask them to Think-Pair-Share:

“What habits of character and academic mindsets did you see in this excerpt? Who demonstrated them? What did they look/sound like?” (Dr. Sara Josephine Baker demonstrated perseverance as she tracked down Mary Mallon.)

- Ask students to retrieve their **Mindsets and Habits of Character handout**, their **Solve *Patient Zero***, **Chapter 4 note-catcher**, and the **Solve *Patient Zero***, **Chapter 4 note-catcher** ▲ as necessary. The differentiated note-catcher supports students in analyzing interactions among individuals, events, and ideas with sentence starters. ▲ Have students fill in the note-catcher independently with details from the reading. Student responses will be reviewed in the following activity. Consult the **Solve *Patient Zero***, **Chapter 4 note-catcher (pages 79–83) (for teacher reference)** as necessary.

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time A, students may note the author’s use of dashes on pages 79–83. For further practice with dashes from the Language Dive in Lessons 6–7, ask students to work with a partner who needs heavier support to determine the purpose of each dash on that page. To guide students’ analysis, ask, “Why did the author use a dash here?” If necessary, follow up with questions such as, “Does the dash emphasize information or make a connection between information?”

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time A, students may note the author’s use of dashes on pages 79–83. For further practice with dashes from the Language Dive in Lessons 6–7, ask students to work with a partner who needs lighter support to determine the purpose of each dash on that page. To guide students’ analysis, ask, “Why did the author use a dash here?” If necessary, follow up with questions such as, “Does the dash emphasize information or make a connection between information?”

Work Time

B. Create an Interactive Flowchart of Individuals, Events, and Ideas – RI.7.3 (15 minutes)

- Distribute the **Interactive Flowchart directions** to each triad, and read aloud the steps. Then model how to complete the activity.

- Place the precut text and arrow cards from the **Interactive Flowchart cards and arrows** document on the board using magnets, tape, or technology. Leave space between the cards. Invite students to make a connection between two cards.

- Review the Interactive Flowchart activity directions:

- Choose an Interactive Flowchart card. Read the card aloud (e.g., Dr. Sara Josephine Baker tracked down Mary and found she was still working as a cook.).

- Using an arrow card, connect this card to another Interactive Flowchart card (e.g., The idea of an asymptomatic carrier was still brand new and frightening.).

- Read the second card aloud.

- Explain why the two Interactive Flowchart cards belong together, how one influences the other (e.g., Mary kept working as a cook because she didn’t think she could be an asymptomatic carrier. Being an asymptomatic carrier was a new idea at that time.).

- Another member of the group takes a turn by either

<!-- -->

- adding a new arrow and another card anywhere on the “flowchart”;

- verbally explaining a new connection between any of the cards already connected on the table; or

- writing an event, action of a key individual, or an idea from the text on an index card and then using an arrow to add it to the flowchart.

<!-- -->

- Take turns using the remaining Interactive Flowchart cards and continuing to explain the connections between them.

- The activity ends when time is up or when all cards have been used and group members have explained all the connections they see.

- Invite students to create the Interactive Flowchart in triads. Once students complete their flowcharts, ask volunteers to share with the class one new connection they made.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time B, invite students to use the Solve *Patient Zero*, Chapter 4 note-catcher ▲ from Lesson 10. The sentence starters in this resource support students in analyzing the interactions of individuals, events, and ideas.

Closing and Assessment

A. Discuss Interactions of Individuals, Events, and Ideas – RI.7.3 (10 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze how individuals, events, and ideas interact with one another.”

- Tell students that they will now look at how these individuals interacted with one another and how events and ideas of the time all interacted to help them solve the mystery of typhoid.

- Distribute **Discussion Prompts: *Patient Zero***, **Pages 79–83** and **Discussion Prompts:** ***Patient Zero***, **Pages 79–83** ▲ as necessary. The differentiated note-catcher supports students in discussing and analyzing interactions among individuals, events, and ideas with sentence starters. ▲ Organize students into triads to have a discussion, referring students to the handout to ask one another questions and to the Solve *Patient Zero*, Chapter 4 note-catcher for their responses. Remind students to follow discussion norms and utilize conversation cues. Refer them to the **Discussion Norms anchor chart** as necessary. Circulate to prompt students with the follow-up questions on the handout. Refer to **Discussion Prompts: *Patient Zero***, **Pages 79–83 (for teacher reference)** for possible student responses.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- Before Closing and Assessment A, if students need the support in preparation for their collaborative discussion, distribute the Discussion Prompts: *Patient Zero*, Pages 79–83 handout, and challenge students to create sentence starters to answer each question. Remind students to also create sentence starters to give evidence that supports their responses. Creating sentence starters gives students confidence with language structures they can use in their discussions.

For Heavier Support

- Before Closing and Assessment A, if students need the support in preparation for their collaborative discussion, distribute the Discussion Prompts: *Patient Zero*, Pages 79–83 handout ▲. This resource includes sentence starters to support students in generating language during a discussion. Allow time for students to complete the sentence starters in writing and orally rehearse their statements with a partner. Writing down and practicing sentences they can use in a discussion gives students confidence to increase their successful participation.

- For students who do not need as much support at this point, just distribute the Discussion Prompts: *Patient Zero*, Pages 79–83 handout ▲ during Closing and Assessment A. This resource includes sentence starters to support students in generating language during a discussion.

Homework

A. Respond to Questions

- In preparation for similar questions on the end of unit assessment, students complete **Handout: Analyze Interactions: *Patient Zero***, **Pages 79–83** to respond to selected and constructed response items to synthesize their understanding of how the individuals, events, and ideas interact in the excerpt.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread pages 83–88 of *Patient Zero* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.

For Lighter Support

- Allow time at the end of class for students to preview the homework questions, especially the constructed response prompt. Challenge students to work with a partner who needs heavier support to paraphrase the prompt and then draft sentence starters for the topic and concluding sentences as well as sentence starters that introduce text evidence to support their response. Drafting sentence starters for their classmates allows students to rehearse their own responses to the prompt.

- As in Lessons 8–9, consider whether students still need to work with the Synopsis: *Patient Zero*, Pages 83–88 or whether they are ready to be released into prereading the text without this support.

For Heavier Support

- Allow time at the end of class for students to preview the homework questions, especially the constructed response prompt. Challenge students to work with a partner who needs lighter support to paraphrase the prompt and then draft sentence starters for the topic and concluding sentences as well as sentence starters that introduce text evidence to support their response. Drafting sentence starters for their classmates allows students to rehearse their own responses to the prompt.

- As in Lessons 8–9, provide students with the Synopsis: *Patient Zero*, Pages 83–88, and ask them to highlight and illustrate it after they have completed their prereading.
