“Tool of the Trade: Putting Disease under the Microscope”

- In 1907, lab tests to identify bacteria were new.

- George Soper was familiar with cutting-edge (new) medicine.

- He knew how to see typhoid under a microscope.

- Bacteriology (the study of bacteria) was the only way to know Mary Mallon was the source of the outbreaks.

“Round Two”

- Dr. Josephine Baker, along with two police officers, was given the job of taking Mary to the hospital.

- Mary disappeared but was found in a tiny cupboard.

- The doctor and the officers took her away even though she protested.

- Soper was correct: Mary was the carrier.

- Typhoid is a very serious disease. Patients get headaches, fevers, diarrhea, cramps, and fatigue.

- Typhoid is caused by eating or drinking something contaminated with the bacteria *Salmonella typhi*. People who have typhoid shed the bacteria in their feces.

- A vaccine against typhoid (*Salmonella typhi*) was not developed until 1911. In 1906, all that doctors could do was try to bring down their patients’ fevers and wait for the disease to run its course.

- The city quarantined Mary on an island in the middle of New York’s East River. This meant she had to live alone.

“Dr. Josephine Baker: Public Health Pioneer”

- Dr. Baker worked as a part-time medical inspector to earn more money.

- Dr. Baker was interested in the connection between poverty and poor health.

- She developed programs to help children, like making sure they had access to vaccinations and milk and providing adults with training for infant care.

- Dr. Baker’s policies reduced the child mortality (death) rate in New York City.
