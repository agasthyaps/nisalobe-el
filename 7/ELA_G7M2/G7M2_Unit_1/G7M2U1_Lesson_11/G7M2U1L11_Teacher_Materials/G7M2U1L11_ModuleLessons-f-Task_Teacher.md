Student responses will vary but should include that Dr. Josephine Baker was tasked with finding and testing Mary because she was one of the few women doctors working for the New York City Health Department. New York City was “trying to clean up its act” (82) by improving its sanitation; clearing the streets of garbage, manure, and sewage; and reducing typhoid cases. The health department officials quarantined those they thought were a danger. This idea influenced officials like George Soper and Baker to hunt down Mary like a “fugitive.”
