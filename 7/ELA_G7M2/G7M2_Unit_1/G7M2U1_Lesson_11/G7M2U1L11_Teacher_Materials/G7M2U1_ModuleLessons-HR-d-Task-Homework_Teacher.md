6.  Synthesize the group discussion from class by writing one paragraph explaining how the individuals, events, and ideas in pages 79–83 of *Patient Zero* interact with one another. Use the selected response questions above and these follow-up questions to support you in writing your paragraph:

- Why was Dr. Josephine Baker tasked with finding and testing Mary?

- Which ideas, events, and individuals would you use to support the idea that Mary was a “fugitive”?

- Which ideas led to Mary’s quarantine?

**Responses will vary. Sample response:**

**Dr. Josephine Baker was tasked with finding and testing Mary. The text explains that this was because she was “one of the city’s only female doctors” (80). The idea that Mary would respond better to a woman seemed to be influencing them. But Dr. Baker and the guards who came with her had to forcibly take Mary. Another important event to consider was that New York City was focused on “cleaning up their act” (78). The health department was seen as the “warrior” in this fight to get cleaner and was allowed to go into people’s homes and confine them or quarantine them. This is the idea that allowed them to quarantine Mary.**
