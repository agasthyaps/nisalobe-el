Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.7.5 – On the Entrance Ticket, students consider the gist and structure of the sections of *Patient Zero* they have already read in class in previous lessons.

- RI.7.1 – Work Time B: Students cite evidence from the text as they answer questions during the close read.

- RI.7.5 – Work Time B: Students participate in a close read to practice identifying the structures the author uses to organize *Patient Zero* and analyzing how sections of the text contribute to the whole and develop ideas.

- RI.7.10 – Closing and Assessment A: Students launch independent research reading, selecting a book that is related to epidemics that they can read independently.

- In Work Time A, students participate in a close reading of *Patient Zero*. During this close read, students focus on how the author structures the text. The Close Reading Guide lists the text excerpts, key questions to ask students, and instructional moves required. Continue to use discussion protocols (e.g., Think-Pair-Share, Conversation Cues, and total participation techniques) to engage all students in a collaborative discussion about the text.

- Students focus on working to become effective learners by collaborating as they work in triads throughout the lesson.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release more responsibility more quickly to students as they comprehend the tasks or concepts. For example:

- Allow students to read and complete the note-catcher on their own, with less guidance or prompting.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students examined the structure of *Patient Zero*, focusing on determining the gists of different sections and analyzing how the sections related to each other. In this lesson, students refine this skill to a greater level of detail by focusing on a portion of the text during a close read.

Support All Students

- The subject matter in this excerpt includes descriptions of death and disease. Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this chapter that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually.

- Students may need additional support with recording their answers on their note-catchers. Group together those students for additional support when necessary.

- Note there are differentiated versions of the Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 3 used in Opening A and the Close Reading: *Patient Zero*, Pages 18, 20, and 23 note-catcher used in Work Time A in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson guides them through a carefully sequenced close read that will extend their reading skills in structure analysis and is challenging yet scaffolded in its use of a series of discrete, connected questions.

- ELLs may find it challenging to select an independent research reading text in a short period of time. Ensure there are many texts on a variety of topics and levels related to epidemics. Also, share and recommend particular books by giving brief and enticing summaries. Finally, make sure students understand the purpose of this task. Emphasize the benefits of reading multiple texts on the same topic (e.g., repeated exposure to relevant vocabulary). Help ELLs who need heavier support while reading to locate simpler texts. Texts written slightly below a student’s reading level facilitate gains in reading speed and support reading fluency development—a critical skill for academic readers of all levels.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, 7.I.B.6, 7.I.C.10, 7.I.C.12, and 7.II.A.1.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Close Reading note-catchers to ensure students understand how the author structures the text in order to tell her story.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue to read *Patient Zero* and analyze the text in terms of structure, focusing on how the author structures different sections and relates them to each other and the whole.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Ensure there is a copy of Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 3 at each student’s workspace.

- Strategically group students into triads for the work in this lesson, with at least one strong reader per triad.

- Preview the Close Reading Guide: *Patient Zero* Pages 18, 20, and 23 and Close Read: *Patient Zero*, Pages 18, 20, and 23 note-catcher to become familiar with what will be required of students.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous modules to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.7.5 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 3** and **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 3** ▲ as necessary. The differentiated note-catcher supports students in analyzing structures with a descriptive list of the different organizational structures and sentence frames. ▲

- Once all students are ready, use total participation techniques (equity sticks, cold calling) to select students to share their responses to the entrance ticket question.

- Repeated routine: follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

- With students, use the vocabulary strategies on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart** to deconstruct the word *contribute* (to give for a reason; to help develop). Record the word on the **academic word wall** with translations in home languages, where appropriate, and invite students to record it in their **vocabulary logs**.

For Lighter Support

- Before Work Time A, ensure students understand the excerpt they will close read by allowing time for them to share with a partner (who may need heavier support) their highlights and illustrations on the Synopsis: *Patient Zero*, Pages 14–20 and 23 from the previous lesson’s homework.

For Heavier Support

- During Opening A, invite students to use the Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 3 ▲. This resource supports students in analyzing structures with a descriptive list of the different organizational structures and sentence starters.

- Before Work Time A, ensure students understand the content of the excerpt they will close read by allowing time for them to review with a partner (who may need lighter support) their highlights and illustrations on the Synopsis: *Patient Zero*, Pages 14–20 and 23 from the previous lesson’s homework.

Work Time

A. Close Read: *Patient Zero*, Pages 18, 20, and 23 – RI.7.1, RI.7.5 (25 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify the structures Peters uses to organize pages 18, 20, and 23 of *Patient Zero*.”

“I can explain how sections of *Patient Zero* contribute to the whole chapter.”

- Focus students on the Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart, and remind them that digging into the text deeper can help them understand it better, so they are going to dig deeper into an excerpt from the text through close reading.

- Move students into predetermined triads.

- Direct students’ attention to the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**, and review what collaboration looks and sounds like. Explain that students will use collaboration as they closely read part of *Patient Zero*.

- Use **Close Reading Guide: *Patient Zero***, **Pages 18, 20, and 23 (for teacher reference)** to set the purpose of the close read and to guide students through a close read of this excerpt. Refer to the guide for how to integrate the following:

- ***Patient Zero*** by Marilee Peters

- **Close Reading: *Patient Zero***, **Pages 18, 20, and 23 note-catcher**

- **Close Reading: *Patient Zero***, **Pages 18, 20, and 23 note-catcher** ▲ as necessary. The differentiated note-catcher supports students in analyzing structures with a descriptive list of the different organizational structures and sentence starters. ▲

- **Domain-specific word wall**

- Refer to **Close Reading: *Patient Zero***, **Pages 18, 20, and 23 note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** as necessary. Also, use the **Synopsis: *Patient Zero***, **Pages 14–20 and 23** to review the text if students need support.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- After the close read in Work Time A, encourage students to create their own “mental maps” that visually depict the structural relationship between pages 18, 20, and 23. Students can then reproduce these mental maps on a sticky note and place them in their texts, sharing them with ELLs who need heavier support. Students can refer to these maps in the future when analyzing the structure of other sections of the text.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time A, invite students to use the Close Reading: *Patient Zero*, Pages 18, 20, and 23 note-catcher ▲. This resource supports students in analyzing structures with selected responses and sentence starters.

Closing and Assessment

A. Launch Independent Research Reading – RI.7.10 (15 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can select a research reading text that I want to read.”

- Launch independent reading for this module. There is a suggested independent reading launch in **Independent Reading Sample Plans** (see the Tools page, http://eled.org/tools). Remind students that they were introduced to independent research reading in Module 1.

- At the end of 5 minutes, distribute students’ **independent reading journals**.

- Remind students they will use this journal to log their independent reading, both choice and research reading, and to answer reading prompts.

- Display the independent reading pages of the **Homework Resources (for Families)**, and focus students on the information they need to record using the example on the same page.

- As necessary, model how to log independent reading without the prompt. Remind students that they will log their research reading in the front of the book and choice reading in the back. Ensure that students understand the difference between independent research reading (topical texts) and choice reading (any texts they want to read).

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Determine Meaning of Unfamiliar Vocabulary

- Students use context and, if necessary, a dictionary to determine the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary in pages 14–20 and 23 of *Patient Zero*. Students then record the words and their definitions in the correct section of their vocabulary log.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread pages 21–31 of *Patient Zero* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.

For Lighter Support

- Provide students with the Synopsis: *Patient Zero*, Pages 21–31, and ask them to highlight the key individuals, events, and ideas in the text once they have completed their prereading. Then they can make sketches in the margins of the synopsis to convey the gist of each section. Doing so after reading will confirm their comprehension of the complex text.

For Heavier Support

- Provide students with the Synopsis: *Patient Zero*, Pages 21–31, with key individuals, events, and ideas highlighted. Encourage students to read the synopsis before they complete their prereading. Then they can make sketches in the margins of the synopsis to convey the gist of each section. Doing so before reading will increase their comprehension of the complex text.
