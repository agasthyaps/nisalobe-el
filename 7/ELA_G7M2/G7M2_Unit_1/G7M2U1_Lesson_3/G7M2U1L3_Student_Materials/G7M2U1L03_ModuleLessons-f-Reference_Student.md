**Name:** **Date:**

**“The Fear Builds” and “Looking for Answers”**

- The Bills of Mortality was a weekly list of births and deaths from the church.

- John Graunt read these Bills of Mortality.

- The Bills of Mortality helped him buy cloth for his store. The number of births told him how much baby cloth to buy. The number of deaths told him how much death cloth to buy.

- Graunt also studied the Bills of Mortality to figure out why people died.

**“What About Dying of Curiosity?”**

- The Bills of Mortality lists some surprising causes of death:

- Stoppage in the stomach

- Twisting of the guts

- Eaten by lice

- “Horseshoe-head”

**“Success at Last”**

- Graunt studied sixty years of the Bills of Mortality. Then he wrote a book about it.

- His book was a success. An important club of scientists invited him to join them.

- His biggest discovery was that he could predict a plague year.

- In the month before a plague outbreak, the death rates were higher.

**“Descriptive Epidemiology”**

- Epidemiologists study who is getting sick and why. They study how the disease is spreading. They study how it can be stopped.

- John Graunt used “descriptive epidemiology.” This means collecting the information to describe who, where, and when in an outbreak.

- Epidemiologists use this information to figure out how the disease is spreading and how to fight the disease.

**“The Sickly Year Theory”**

- In 1603, King James I ordered churches to record and report births and deaths.

- Churches paid people called “searchers” to do this work. The searchers were not trained. So they guessed at the cause of death.

- Graunt estimated that twenty percent of deaths were recorded wrong.

- Also, people who weren’t in the church were not recorded (such as Jews, Catholics, Quakers, and Non-Conformists). So there were many births and deaths missing.

- In summer, the number of plague deaths increased (went up).

- Many people left the city so they wouldn’t get sick.

- Graunt stayed in the city. He wanted to see if his theory was true. (His theory was that there were more deaths in the years before plague years.)

**“Graunt’s Legacy”**

- Graunt’s theory helps epidemiologists.

- There were more deaths before the Spanish influenza epidemic. But they were recorded as pneumonia, not influenza.
