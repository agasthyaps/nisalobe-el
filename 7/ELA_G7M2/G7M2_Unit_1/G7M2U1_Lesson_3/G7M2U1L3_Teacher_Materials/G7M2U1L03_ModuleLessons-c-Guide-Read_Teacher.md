Close Reading Guide: *Patient Zero*,  
Pages 18, 20, and 23

RI.7.1, RI.7.5

(For Teacher Reference)

**Purpose and Notes**

- This close read is intended for students to analyze the structures an author uses to organize a text, including how major sections contribute to the development of ideas. Students also consider the author’s purpose in structuring portions of the text in a specific way.

- For the previous lesson’s homework, have students preread pages 14–23 of Patient Zero for context. Students will focus only on pages 18, 20, and 23 in the close read.

- During the read-aloud, prompt students to follow along. Read each excerpt aloud before asking the questions.

- Students respond orally, except where noted in the directions. Continue to use discussion protocols (e.g., Turn and Talk, cold call, and total participation techniques) to engage all students in collaborative discussion about the text.

- The **Close Reading: *Patient Zero*, Pages 18, 20, and 23 note-catcher** contains text-dependent questions and provides a written opportunity for students to analyze the structures the author uses to organize and convey ideas.

<li><p>Clarify that a parish clerk was an official employed by a church organization.</p></li>
<li><p>“What was the problem with the parish clerks tracking down all of the births and deaths in the city?” (There weren’t enough clerks.)</p></li>

<td><ul>
<li><p>Read the text aloud, directing students to follow along.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “What were the problems with the system?” (Parish clerks and searchers did not have a medical background, which resulted in “unusual entries in the Bills of Mortality” (20). The searchers were often poor and were poorly paid. As a result, they could be bribed to record inaccurate information. Finally, the parish clerks only recorded the births and deaths of citizens who belonged to the official religion of the time, the Church of England, which left out other religious groups.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask:</p></li>
<li><p>“Who can remind us of what Graunt’s theory is?” (An increase in diseases precedes plague years.)</p></li>
<li><p>“What connections can you make between the problems collecting accurate causes of death and Graunt’s theory?” (It is likely that people didn’t have these other diseases; rather, they actually had the plague.)</p></li>
<li><p>Distribute the <strong>Close Reading: <em>Patient Zero</em>, Pages 18, 20, and 23 note-catcher</strong>. Direct students’ attention to the Explanatory Text Structure heading in the table and the question, “What is the purpose of each section of the text?” Tell students that they will be working with the column on the left for now about pages 18 and 20, which is the section of the book called “The Sickly Year Theory.”</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “Based on what we have read so far, what is the purpose of pages 18 and 20?” (to explain why there were so many deaths recorded as something else in the year before a plague)</p></li>
<li><p>Provide a few minutes for students to Turn and Talk about this question, and then provide time for students to record responses in the note-catcher.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “What can you infer about Graunt’s ideas about why deaths from ‘other causes’ increased just before an outbreak of the plague?” (These people actually had the same illness as the outbreak and not something else. The causes of death during the sickly years were recorded inaccurately. This makes it hard to determine what people actually died from.)</p></li>
<li><p>Cold-call on students to share their thinking.</p></li>

<td><ul>
<li><p>Read the text aloud, directing students to follow along.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “Why did Graunt risk his own health that summer to prove his theory?” (Graunt had formed his theory in spite of only having access to inaccurate and limited information about the deaths in London. He was prepared to test his theory that the increase in deaths in the previous months were actually from the plague, which was about to hit hard that summer.)</p></li>
<li><p>Cold-call on students to share their thinking.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “How is the section we have just read mainly structured?”</p></li>
<li><p>Invite students to Turn and Talk. Circulate and listen to their shared thinking.</p></li>
<li><p>Since this is only the second time students are considering the structure of this text, cold-call on students who are on the right track.</p></li>
<li><p>If no responses seem accurate, share with students that this section is structured by explaining how the death rate information was collected as well as Graunt’s idea that knowing the information was inaccurate might help us understand what was happening during “the sickly years.” Share with students that this type of text can be called <strong>explanatory</strong>.</p></li>
