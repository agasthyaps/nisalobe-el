<p>How does the explanation of the inaccurate and incomplete information about the causes of death (18 and 20) add to the reader’s understanding of Graunt’s theory and the section “Graunt’s Legacy” (23)? Use specific evidence from the text to support your answer.</p></td>

<td colspan="2">On pages 18 and 20 of the text, the author explains <strong>how the cause-of-death information Graunt had access to was sometimes inaccurate or incomplete.</strong> This was because the searchers <strong>“had no medical background” (18), they could be bribed to change the cause of death (20), and they did not collect information from people who did not belong to their church (20).</strong> Graunt’s theory was that <strong>the death rate increased before the plague years and that these deaths were not from other causes but were actually from the plague. Hundreds of years after the plague in London,</strong> his theory continues to help <strong>“epidemiologists pinpoint and stop disease outbreaks today” (23). However, the section on page 23 also explains that there is still a risk of misinterpreting causes of death, which could increase the risk of missing an important clue to an impending epidemic.</strong></td>
