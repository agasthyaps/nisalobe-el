**“The Great Plague of London, 1665” and “Signs in the Sky”**

- Goodwoman Phillips found a dead rat.

- She got sick.

- One astrologer thought it meant evil was coming.

- John Gadbury, an English astronomer, thought the comet meant famine, plague, wars, death, and crises.

- People connected the plague and the comet because there was an old superstition that the crowning of a new king would be followed by plague.

**“House Call”**

- A doctor came to cut Goodwoman Phillips. This was called “bleeding.” People thought this would help them feel better.

- Goodwoman Phillips died.

**“It’s Not Funny, It’s Humoral”**

- People in ancient Greece believed in humoral theory.

- People thought there were four “humors,” or fluids, in the body: black bile, red bile, blood, and phlegm.

- People thought you had to have a balance of humors to be healthy.

- Cutting patients was supposed to balance the humors.

**“God Have Mercy on Us!”**

- A neighbor came to get Goodwoman Phillips’ body ready for burial. She saw spots on the body that looked like the plague.

- Everyone was afraid of the plague because it spread quickly.

- Men from the church put boards on her windows. Then they painted a huge red cross and the words “God Have Mercy on Us” over the door. This told neighbors that the plague was in that house.

- Neighbors were frightened and stayed away from the house.

**“Blast from the Past”**

- The first plague was the Plague of Justinian in Constantinople in 541 CE. It killed millions of people.

- The plague didn’t reach pandemic levels again until 1347, with the Black Death in Europe. Some historians think one-third of the population died in the pandemic.
