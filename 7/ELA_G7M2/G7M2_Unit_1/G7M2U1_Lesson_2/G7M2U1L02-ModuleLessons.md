Grade 7: Module 2: Unit 1: Lesson 2

Lesson Overview

Lesson Summary

Students begin reading the anchor text of the module, *Patient Zero*, determining the gist and noting new vocabulary. Then with modeling and guidance, students begin to analyze how the author structures the text, how major sections contribute to the whole and to the development of ideas.

Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- L.7.4c – Opening A: Students practice using a dictionary as a strategy to determine the meanings of unfamiliar words.

- SL.7.1 – Opening B: Students use the Think-Pair-Shareprotocol to engage in collaborative discussions about the module guiding questions.

- RI.7.5 – Work Time B: Students learn to identify the structures the author uses to organize *Patient Zero*.

- In Opening B, students reflect on the module guiding questions. This is not mandatory—students share their reflections only if they want to do so. It is important to be sensitive to students’ and families’ feelings and experiences with epidemics, given that students and their families may have faced health concerns or the loss of family members and friends throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.

- Students focus on working to become ethical people by showing respect and empathy as they share reflections on the guiding questions in Opening B.

- Students reflect on academic mindsets in Opening B of this lesson. Academic mindsets refer to the motivational components that influence a student’s desire and will to engage in learning. Research shows that academic mindsets are a better predictor of student success than any other determining factor. Students will develop an understanding of all four as the module progresses. The Academic Mindsets are:

- I belong in this academic community.

- I can succeed at this.

- My ability and competence grow with my effort.

- This work has value for me.

- The Think-Pair-Share protocol is used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning. Students also engage in the following new protocol in this lesson (instructions for which appear at the first point of use in the lesson and in the Classroom Protocols document online on the Tools page: http://eled.org/tools):

<!-- -->

- Jigsaw: Allows small groups to engage in an effective, time-efficient comprehension of a longer text. Having every student read every page or section may not be necessary. Students can divide up the text, become an expert on one section, hear summaries and analysis of the others, and still gain an understanding of the material.

<!-- -->

- In Work Time A, students review how to synthesize each section of the chapter into a short gist (or general idea of what happens), which gives students an opportunity to make inferences and draw on the text for evidence. They record these overall gists on a sticky note. Students should record the chapter number and their initials on each sticky note to ensure their being returned to original order or owner. Students will also record gists of specific subsections on note-catchers throughout the unit. Knowing the gist of specific subsections will help students identify text structures and analyze how the subsection relates to the whole section or chapter.

- As students begin reading the text *Patient Zero* in Work Time A, they note unfamiliar vocabulary on their vocabulary logs, and they generate questions about epidemics. These questions will be answered during research in Unit 3.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Allow those students who are identifying the gist and other elements quickly the opportunity to develop their own text-dependent questions about the chapter, related to structure. Ask these students to share their questions with the group as a way of generating discussion. (RI.7.5)

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lesson, students were introduced to the topic and the anchor text, *Patient Zero*. In this lesson, students have the opportunity to engage with the text and begin analyzing how the author structures the text to tell her story.

Support All Students

- Read aloud the first several excerpts of *Patient Zero* in these first lessons to ensure student comprehension, engagement, and enjoyment of the text. However, if all students are already engaged, determine how students will read pages 9–14 and 17 of *Patient Zero* to best support their comprehension, or give students choice to build empowerment and engagement in learning. Alternatives to read-alouds include: another fluent reader (including students or an audiobook) reads aloud to the whole class, small groups, triads, or pairs; individuals read silently; or a combination of any of these. Also as necessary, consider pre-highlighting one or two key sentences in each subsection which articulate the gist.

- Note there is a differentiated version of the *Patient Zero* Lesson 2 note-catcher used in Work Time B in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- The subject matter in this excerpt includes descriptions of death and disease. Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this chapter that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually. Students may need additional support rereading the text to determine the gist. Pair students strategically to ensure that each pair includes at least one strong reader.

- For Work Time B, consider forming strategic groups for the Jigsaw activity, so that students who need more support are grouped with those who may have previous experience with or are likely to understand text structure. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson uses a collaborative protocol for students to co-create an anchor chart to explain the abstract concept of text structure, a key concept for this unit. This and the following lessons also use a gradual release model to further support students with understanding text structure.

- ELLs may find it challenging to recognize different text structures in English if they are unfamiliar with some or all the vocabulary being used to define the structures or with concrete examples of the structures being described. In addition to the supports below, pull ELLs who need more support into a group during the Jigsaw activity and working to find simple and familiar examples of each of the informational text structures.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, 7.I.B.6, and 7.II.A.1.

Assessment Guidance

- Check student gist statements to ensure they understand the chapter.

- Listen to student discussions to identify common issues that can be used as whole group teaching points against the criteria recorded on the Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue reading *Patient Zero* and also launch their independent research reading for homework. Students will use the information gathered from these sources for the performance task of the module: creating a podcast telling the story of an epidemic and those who responded to it.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Ensure there is a copy of Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 2 at each student’s workspace.

- Create the Text Structure anchor chart. (See Text Structure anchor chart \[for teacher reference\].)

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous lessons to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing. ▲

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.7.4c (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 2**. Encourage ELLs and other students who need more support to use a **dictionary (print, online, ELL, or translation)** to define the terms on the entrance ticket. ▲

- Once all students are ready, use a total participation technique (equity sticks, cold calling) to select students to share their responses to the entrance ticket question.

- Repeated routine: follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

- With students, use the vocabulary strategies on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart** to deconstruct the word *structure* (how something is organized, how the parts relate to the whole). Also, as necessary, review the meanings of the words *determine* and *gist*. Record these words on the **academic word wall** and **domain-specific word wall**, with translations in home languages, where appropriate, and invite students to record these words in their **vocabulary logs**.

Opening

B. Reflect on the Module Guiding Questions – SL.7.1 (5 minutes)

- Remind students that in the previous lesson they were introduced to the guiding questions for the module. Invite students to reread the **Module Guiding Questions anchor chart**.

- Invite students to share stories about their own personal connections to the topic and the guiding questions.

- Remind students that for homework they were asked to reflect on what those guiding questions mean to them and how they feel about them.

- Focus students on the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**, and review respect, compassion, and empathy as needed.

- Tell students they will now have the opportunity to share their reflections, if they would like to, with the whole group. Remind students to respond with respect and empathy as necessary.

- Invite volunteers to share their reflections with the whole group. Be prepared to discuss any issues students feel they need to discuss further.

- Incorporate reflection on and awareness of the following academic mindset: “I belong in this community.”

- Ask:

“How do empathy, compassion, and respect help you feel a sense of belonging in this classroom community?” (Responses will vary, but may include: when my classmates listen to me and show they understand my feelings, I feel like I have a safe place in this classroom.)

Work Time

A. Read *Patient Zero*, Pages 9–14 (up to “The Fear Builds”) and 17 (15 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can find the gist of pages 9–14 and 17 of *Patient Zero*.”

- Invite students to retrieve their ***Patient Zero*** **text**, and to turn to page 9. Read aloud pages 9–14 (up to “The Fear Builds”) and 17 as students read along silently. Use the **Text Guide:** ***Patient Zero*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Note that while students may read in small groups or individually in future lessons, students will benefit from this reading of the text as a whole class. ▲

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What happened?” (Goodwoman Phillips noticed a dead rat covered in fleas. She became sick and died of plague. The text explains why people were concerned about comets and how medicine worked during this time. A doctor visited Goodwoman Phillips, but she died anyway. Neighbors were frightened when they discovered it was plague and avoided the house.)

“What is the gist? What is this excerpt mostly about?” (Goodwoman Phillips died from the plague; people responded in fear.)

- Invite a student to paraphrase the key points in more comprehensible language for those who need more support. ▲

- Model recording the gist of the excerpt (keywords, not full sentences) on a **sticky note**, and invite students to do the same, sticking them at the front of the chapter for quick reference. Students will also benefit from adding the page numbers and their initials on the sticky note for easier materials management. As needed, refer to the **Gists: *Patient Zero*** **(example for teacher reference)**.

- Remind students that their goal is to understand what the story is mostly about, and it is okay if there are parts they don’t quite understand yet. ▲

- Use the **Synopsis: *Patient Zero***, **Pages 9–14 and 17** to review and note key details for the entire chapter. This will help to complete students’ understanding of the events of this chapter excerpt, especially if they were not able to complete the reading of the full excerpt. ▲

- Give students 3 minutes to silently reflect on the text. Encourage them to consider how the excerpt made them feel. They can write or sketch, or just sit and think.

- Direct students’ attention to the Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart, and review respect, compassion, and empathy as needed before inviting students to share their reflections if they choose.

- Capture any questions students have about what is happening in the text on the displayed **Questions about Epidemics anchor chart**. Reference **Questions about Epidemics anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** as needed. This first day, encourage students to ask any question. As the weeks progress, guide students to refine the questions to better align to research questions. If necessary, for this lesson, provide sentence frames such as: *Who is . . . ? What is . . . ? How does . . . ? Why does . . . ?*

- Note that although *Patient Zero* does contain graphic descriptions of disease and dying, students are supported throughout the reading of the text. Additionally, inform students that they will be given opportunities to reflect on the text following each reading.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Work Time

B. Analyze Structure: *Patient Zero*, Pages 9–14 and 17 – RI.7.5 (15 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify the structures Peters uses to organize pages 9–14 and 17 of *Patient Zero*.”

- Display the **Text Structure anchor chart**, which should have the text structures listed with enough space for the class to record definitions and examples. Consult the **Text Structure anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**. Explain that this anchor chart lists common informational text structures. As students may have noticed already, the author of *Patient Zero* uses different text structures throughout the book to describe or explain people, events, and information.

- Guide students through a Jigsaw to co-construct the Text Structure anchor chart:

- Divide the class into seven groups, and give each group a large sticky note or piece of paper with tape.

- Assign each a different text structure from the anchor chart.

- Allow groups 3 minutes to define or describe their text structure and give an example from *Patient Zero*, or another text.

- Circulate to guide and correct groups as they grapple.

- Come together as a class and ask each group to explain their text structure and post their sticky note on the anchor chart.

- Work together as a class to refine or correct definitions and examples.

- Distribute the **Text Structure anchor chart** handout, and explain that this is their own version of the Text Structure anchor chart, so they can reference it at any point throughout the unit.

- Then, distribute the ***Patient Zero*** **Lesson 2 note-catcher** and the ***Patient Zero*** **Lesson 2 note-catcher** ▲ as necessary. The differentiated note-catcher supports students in identifying structures with a descriptive list of the different organizational structures. ▲ Point out the various parts of the graphic organizer, and explain why it was designed this way: capturing the gist of each section of the text will help students understand how the author structures the sections and how they relate to one another and to the whole text. Ask students why they think it is important to keep track of the text structures the author uses, as well as why it might make sense to analyze this particular text by looking at its sections. (Analyzing text structures show us how the different parts of the text fit together. It makes sense to analyze this text by sections because that is how the author chose to write it.)

- Focus students on one particular section: “God Have Mercy on Us” on pages 12–14. Instruct students to briefly skim or reread the section. Ask for a volunteer to provide a gist for the section (neighbor discovers Goodwoman Phillips died of plague; panic spreads throughout neighborhood). Instruct students to write this gist down in the proper section of the *Patient Zero* Lesson 2 note-catcher.

- Invite students to work with partners to identify the structure of this section, using the Text Structure handout. Circulate among students to offer extra support. Consider asking questions such as:

“What kind of information is being given in this section? How is the information organized? Is it telling a problem and a solution? Is it comparing and contrasting two things? Is it telling a story?” ▲

- Ask for student volunteers to share which type of text structure they identified for this section. Listen for student responses, and lead students to an understanding that this section is narration, as it tells the story about what happened after Goodwoman Phillips was found dead. Ask students:

“How does this section further the author’s purpose? Why would the author structure it as narration to help get her point across?” (This section helps to explain the plague epidemic by telling the story of an individual who died from the plague. Structuring it as narration helps to make the story interesting and to give a clear example of what it was like to get the plague during that time.)

- Inform students that as they read, they will identify how the different sections contribute to the text. Ensure that students have an understanding that in general, the plain white background with black text tells the main part of the story, and the other sections add to this story.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time B, the Text Structure anchor chart is introduced. Because this anchor chart is critical to the unit, yet also very abstract, ask students to make a bilingual version in English and their home language. Making bilingual versions of documents that are abstract, complex, and central to the learning of a unit supports ELLs by ensuring that they have access to critical information they need to do their work well.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time B, the Text Structure anchor chart is introduced. Because this anchor chart is critical to the unit, yet also very abstract, provide students with a bilingual version in English and their home language. (If appropriate, ELLs who need lighter support can make the bilingual version for their classmates.) Using bilingual versions of documents that are abstract, complex, and central to the learning of a unit supports ELLs by ensuring that they have access to critical information they need to do their work well.

- During Work Time B, invite students to use the *Patient Zero* Lesson 2 note-catcher ▲. This resource supports students in analyzing structures with a descriptive list of the different organizational structures.

Closing and Assessment

A. Check for Understanding – RI.7.5 (5 minutes)

- Direct students’ attention to the selected response question on the *Patient Zero* Lesson 2 note-catcher. Reread the text aloud for students. Either as a whole class or in small groups, work with students to answer the selected response question on the note-catcher. Invite student volunteers to share their answers and any strategies they used to answer the question. ▲

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- Before students report out on their answers to the selected response question, have them first share their answer with a table partner. Enabling ELLs to rehearse their responses in a small, potentially more supportive context before they attempt to explain it to the whole class will build their confidence.

For Heavier Support

- Before students report out on their answers to the selected response question, have them first share their answer with a partner in their native language. Enabling ELLs to rehearse their responses in their own language before translating them into English for the whole group will build their confidence and comprehension.

Homework

A. Determine Meaning of Unfamiliar Vocabulary

- Students use context and, if necessary, a dictionary to determine the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary in pages 9–14 (up to “The Fear Builds”) and 17 of *Patient Zero*. Students then record the words and their definitions in the correct section of their vocabulary log.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread pages 14–20 and 23 of *Patient Zero* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.

For Lighter Support

- Provide students with the Synopsis: *Patient Zero*, Pages 14–20 and 23, and ask them to highlight the key individuals, events, and ideas in the text once they have completed their prereading. Then they can make sketches in the margins of the synopsis to convey the gist of each section. Doing so after reading will confirm their comprehension of the complex text.

For Heavier Support

- Provide students with the Synopsis: *Patient Zero*, Pages 14–20 and 23, with key individuals, events, and ideas highlighted. Encourage students to read the synopsis before they complete their prereading. Then they can make sketches in the margins of the synopsis to convey the gist of each section. Doing so before reading will increase their comprehension of the complex text.
