<p><strong>Why would a comet be an evil omen?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why was bleeding commonly practiced?</strong></p></td>
<td><strong>I will answer these questions by reading on in the book.</strong></td>
<td><p><strong>The section “Signs in the Sky” says that people back then found the plague and the comet terrifying, so they made a connection between the two.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The section “It’s Not Funny, It’s Humoral” explains that people thought there were four humors, or fluids, in the body: black bile, red bile, blood, and phlegm. Your health depended on the correct humoral balance. Bleeding patients came from the idea of putting the humors in balance.</strong></p></td>

<td><p><strong>Knowing the number of births and deaths helped him have enough stock for christening robes and mourning clothes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>He discovered that plagues occur about every twenty years, and that in the years leading up to a plague outbreak, the death rates were higher than usual.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Churches employed searchers who were not trained and generally guessed at the cause of death. Nonmembers of the church were not included, so there were gaps in the statistics.</strong></p></td>

<p><strong>What are examples of products from long ago that claimed to be medicines but were not? What are examples of products from today that claim to be medicines but are not?</strong></p>
<p><strong>What happens when scientists compete for a cure?</strong></p></td>
<td><strong>I will answer the first question by reading on in the book. The second question I can answer about the plague by reading on in the book, but I can get a more in-depth answer through research.</strong></td>
<td><p><strong>The poor could not afford doctors. They tried remedies like holding chickens and birds near the swelling until the birds died, or applying hot onions and figs to the skin. The wealthy enjoyed the “cure” made with nearly sixty ingredients called “Venice Treacle.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>In the case of Shibasaburo Kitasato of Japan and the Swiss Alexander Yersin, both bacteriologists, Kitasato was given a lab and full staff, while Yersin was not. Kitasato was unkind, but Yersin won the race. The bacteria was named <em>Yersinia pestis</em> in his honor.</strong></p></td>

<td><p><strong>In the section “Cures for a Penny,” a perfume known as “Saunder’s Anti-Mephitic Fluid” was said to have cured fevers and cholera.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Broad Street was deserted, and the shops were closed. Everyone who was able to, left to escape the disease. Similarly, after the plague in London, everyone left.</strong></p></td>

<p><strong>What is the connection between miasma and disease? What conditions can cause disease?</strong></p></td>
<td><strong>I can answer all of these questions by reading on in the book and even rereading certain sections. I might want to research them, too, though, to get a variety of sources and a more in-depth answer.</strong></td>
<td><strong>People thought bad smells caused disease. Poor sanitation, overcrowding, and germs cause disease.</strong></td>

<p><strong>How does collaboration help people solve epidemics?</strong></p>
<p><strong>How is Snow’s influence on epidemiology apparent today?</strong></p></td>
<td><strong>The first question, I can answer a bit by reading on in the book, and also by researching. I can answer the second question by reading on in the book.</strong></td>
<td><p><strong>Henry Whitehead and John Snow collaborated to solve the Soho cholera epidemic. Whitehead knocked on doors, while Snow studied the data and mapped the information. Whitehead knew the community, so he was better at knocking on doors. Snow was better at studying data. They both did the tasks that suited them best to figure out the cause of the epidemic.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The section “Mapping Outbreaks” discusses how Snow pioneered mapping for epidemiologists. Today, epidemiologists use software to map epidemics. The section “The Shoe Leather Method” discusses how Snow is known as the father of epidemiology.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Before Snow, doctors didn’t track data. His method of knocking on doors is called “shoe-leather epidemiology” and remains valuable today.</strong></p></td>

<p><strong>What is the situation with cholera today? What can we do to prevent cholera? What can we do to prevent disease?</strong></p></td>
<td><strong>The first and second questions I can answer by reading on in the book, and also by researching. I can answer the third question through research.</strong></td>
<td><p><strong>Cholera came back in 1961, and it is still occurring. Cholera killed 23,000 people in a refugee camp in Rwanda in 1994. In 2010, cholera hit Haiti after an earthquake and killed thousands.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cholera can be prevented with sewage systems, modern sanitation, safe water and food supplies, and peace.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Diseases can be prevented with good hygiene, clean sanitation, clean drinking water, and protection from the spread of germs.</strong></p></td>

<p><strong>How are detectives and epidemiologists similar?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why do new ideas often end in negative consequences?</strong></p></td>
<td><strong>I can answer all the questions by reading on in the book and by researching.</strong></td>
<td><p><strong>Because typhoid was considered a disease of the poor, when a wealthy family contracted typhoid, it was seen as embarrassing and unthinkable.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mary infected others without realizing she was a carrier of typhoid.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Soper acted like a detective, solving a case to figure out that Mary was the healthy carrier. He investigated, gathered evidence, and built his case.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr. Ignac Semelweis suspected that doctors were passing an infection called childbed fever from woman to woman in labor and delivery. He tried having doctors wash their hands in a water-bleach mixture before delivering babies. He presented his idea (without evidence) to the hospital administration. He was fired and later forced to leave Vienna and had a hard time finding work again.</strong></p></td>

<td><strong>I can answer all the questions by reading on in the book and by researching.</strong></td>
<td><p><strong>Mary was quarantined on an island and was unhappy with her loss of freedom.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quarantines help prevent further infection.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quarantines take away people’s civil rights. Also, people tend to panic in quarantine situations, and flee and then spread the disease far and wide.</strong></p></td>

<p><strong>What lessons does Mary teach us?</strong></p></td>
<td><strong>I can answer the first two questions by reading on in the book, and the last question by researching.</strong></td>
<td><p><strong>She is strong, and she is persistent. She fought her case and won.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mary is a villain because she infected so many people with typhoid and went back on her word and worked again as a cook. She is a victim because she lost her civil rights and was quarantined.</strong></p></td>

<p><strong>How would having friends with good grades help you improve your grades?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why won’t close friends impact your grades?</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is social contagion?</strong></p>
<p><strong>What are other aspects of friendships that impact grades?</strong></p></td>
<td><strong>I can answer the questions by reading on in the article and by researching.</strong></td>
<td><p><strong>If you would like to improve your grades, then you might see smarter students as your friends.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Social contagion works like germs. Germs spread easily in close quarters. In the same way, students are more likely to pick up behaviors from those who are close to them.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Longevity of friendships might impact grades.</strong></p></td>

<p><strong>How can peer pressure and conformity be bad?</strong></p></td>
<td><strong>I can answer the questions by reading on in the article and by researching.</strong></td>
<td><p><strong>Kindness can be contagious with behaviors like compromise, tolerance, and warmth. When people see others do good things, they in turn are kinder.</strong></p>
<p><strong>People are peer pressured into voting, eating well, conserving the environment, cooperating, and donating to charity.</strong></p>
<p><strong>People are peer pressured into extreme attitudes and anger.</strong></p></td>

<td><p><strong>You do not need to reinvent the wheel.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Social contagion is defined in the article “How Social Circles Affect Students’ Grades.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>The best predictor of whether someone will join Facebook is the number of groups he or she knows.</strong></p></td>

<td><p>“Are Social Epidemics Real?”</p>
<p><strong>What is today’s example of Hush Puppies—something that became trendy all of a sudden?</strong></p>
<p><strong>How can you catch ideas and emotions?</strong></p></td>
<td><strong>I can answer the questions by reading on in the article and by researching.</strong></td>
<td><p><strong>Ideas spread like viruses, like with the example of Hush Puppies and the “law of the few.” It takes just a few people to spread an idea, like looking up on the sidewalk, just like with diseases. People catch ideas and emotions, too.</strong></p>
<p><strong>People mimic others’ expressions and then feel their feelings.</strong></p></td>
