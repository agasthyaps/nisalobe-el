  **What was Graunt’s “biggest discovery”? What was his theory about why it was happening? Graunt discovered how to predict a plague year by noticing that deaths from all causes were significantly higher leading up to the plague year.

**Vocabulary**

- sterilizing (78): making free of germs

The doctor checked all the usual causes for disease, like a problem in plumbing or bad dairy. He couldn’t identify what the cause might be. But then he heard about a cook, Mary Mallon, who was hired just before the family got sick and then left shortly afterward. Sanitary engineer George Soper thought this was “highly suspicious behavior” (76).**

- page 77, “and chased the madman out”

  **Why did Soper want to test Mary? He was wondering if she was a “healthy carrier” (77), or someone who has typhoid but does not appear to be sick.**

  **What was Mary’s reaction to being taken by the health inspectors? What did New York decide to do with Mary? Mary was very angry and fought the health inspectors. She did not think it was fair to be taken in because she was not sick. The city of New York forced her to live in isolation on an island.**

- laundress (83): a person whose job is washing clothes

- inevitably (85): certain to happen

- mandatory (87): ordered with no choice

- mutating (88): changing, transforming

**Questions**

- page 83, “cross the river back to New York City”

  **Why was Mary allowed to leave the island? Officials thought they had “overreacted” in locking her up because “50 other healthy typhoid carriers” (83) were identified since Mary but not forced to live in isolation.**

- page 87, “Public health officials have to try to balance individuals’ rights with the need to protect the public from disease.”

  **Why does the author think people still find Mary so interesting? The author thinks people find Mary interesting because it is hard to decide whether she is a “villain or victim” (84) because she spread typhoid but was also kept locked up by officials. She had no power but fought for herself. She felt unfairly targeted but kept working as a cook even after she knew she was a “healthy carrier.” All this makes Mary complicated.**
