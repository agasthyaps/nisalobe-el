**Name:** **Date:**

**“The Streets Are Empty”**

- A successful businessman named Samuel Pepys stayed in London and wrote in his diary about how the streets were empty.

- As the weather got colder, fewer people died.

- At the end of the year, John Graunt published his book, estimating that 68,000 people out of a population of 450,000 had died of plague.

**“New Knowledge, But No Cure”**

- In 1665, people still had to learn a lot about the plague.

  People believed in wild preventions: holding coins in your mouth, burning herbs, spices, vinegar and tar, smoking, and wearing amulets (special jewelry).

- Doctors bled and sweat patients, gave them opium, and prayed.

- There were 9,967 christenings and 97,306 burials.

- London eventually returned to normal.

**“Unequal Treatment”**

- The poor could not afford doctors.

- They tried cures like holding birds near a swelling until the birds died, or applying hot onions and figs to their skin.

- The wealthy used a “cure” made with nearly sixty ingredients called “Venice Treacle.”

  **“Finding Answers in Hong Kong”**

- In January 1894, an epidemic of bubonic plague occurred in Hong Kong, killing 80,000 people.

- The governor asked for scientists from around the world to come and help solve the mystery of the plague. An important Japanese scientist named Shibasaburo Kitasato came.

- Kitasato was given a lab and full staff.

- Swiss bacteriologist Alexander Yersin also came but was not given a lab.

- Yersin built his own lab.

- Yersin and Kitasato were in a race to find the source of the plague.

- Yersin won the race in spite of Kitasato’s unkindness. So the bacteria was named *Yersinia pestis* in his honor.

- A French researcher, Paul-Louis Simmond, showed that fleas gave the infection to rats and to humans in 1897.

**“A Perfect Pair: Cities and Disease”**

- Disease spreads quickly in crowded conditions. Until the twentieth century, this caused a lot of people living in the city to die each year from infectious diseases.

- Plague was feared because the epidemic seemed to come from nowhere.

- Rat fleas were the cause. The fleas were infected by biting the rats. Then the fleas infected humans by biting them.

- Trade routes between cities carried rats across Asia and Europe.

**“The Cotton Connection”**

- The plague may have been started by rats and their fleas who traveled on cotton from Holland.

- The first deaths in London happened by the dock.

- John Graunt may have been selling cloth made from the cotton in his shop.

- Traveling can spread diseases.

**“Three Plagues, One Cause”**

- The three types of plague are bubonic, pneumonic, and septicemic.

- They are all caused by the bacteria *Yersinia pestis*.

- Bubonic is the least deadly and creates painful swelling and red and purple markings.

- Pneumonic attacks the lungs and killed nearly everyone who got it.

- Septicemic is rare and affects the bloodstream.

- Today antibiotics can treat eighty-five percent of plague cases, but only if started in the first twenty-four hours.

**“The Future of Plague”**

- In September 1994, plague broke out in a slum in India after an earthquake, and fifty-five people died.

- Everyone panicked. Travel and business stopped.

- Since then, there have been plague outbreaks in Africa.
