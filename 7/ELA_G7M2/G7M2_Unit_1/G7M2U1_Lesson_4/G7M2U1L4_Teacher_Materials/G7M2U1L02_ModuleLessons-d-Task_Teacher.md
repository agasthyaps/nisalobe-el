Gists: *Patient Zero*

(Example for Teacher Reference)

This document lists sample gists for each large section of *Patient Zero*. Students record these overall gists on sticky notes and include the chapter number and their initials to ensure the notes are returned to them in the original order. Students will also record gists of specific subsections on note-catchers throughout the unit. Knowing the gists of specific subsections will help students identify text structures; analyze how the subsection relates to the whole section or chapter; and analyze how events, individuals, and ideas interact.
