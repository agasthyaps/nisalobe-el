Close Reading Guide: “Conflicting Ideas”

RI.7.2

(For Teacher Reference)

**Purpose and Notes**

- This close read is for students to trace the way the author develops the two related central ideas of the article and the connection between them.

- Students will focus only on the selected sections of the text, which are related to the two central ideas.

- For the sake of time, first read aloud the text.

- Have students reread portions of the text as they answer text-dependent questions.

- A note-catcher along with text-dependent questions provide an opportunity for students to determine the two central ideas by first drawing out the common details that are related to each central idea.

- Continue to use discussion protocols (e.g., Think-Pair-Share, Conversation Cues, and total participation techniques) to engage all students in collaborative discussion about the text.

<td>Read paragraph 2 aloud.</td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>On the Close Read: “Conflicting Ideas” note-catcher, direct students’ attention to the paragraph 2 box. Focus students’ attention on the first sentence: “There is nothing wrong with such analogies, of course, and one big advantage of raiding the epidemiologists’ toolbox is that it means that those interested in the spread of ideas rather than germs do not need to re-invent the wheel.” Ask students to underline the sentence. Inform them that they will now use context clues and supporting details to clarify the meaning of the sentence and then rephrase it in their own words.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “What is the meaning of the word <strong>analogies</strong> as it is used in this sentence? How does the first paragraph help us understand what the word is referring to?” (Analogies means “comparisons.” The first paragraph shows that the comparisons the author is talking about are between epidemiology and the spread of ideas.) If students need support, ask them whether they have encountered the word <strong>analogies</strong> before. Guide students to an understanding of how analogies compare one thing to another, as in the example of hands being to humans what paws are to dogs.</p></li>
<li><p>Direct students’ attention to the phrase <strong>epidemiologists’ toolbox</strong>. Remind students of their work looking at “toolboxes” in <em>Patient Zero</em> in the previous unit. Ask: “What does the phrase <strong>raiding epidemiologists’ toolbox</strong> mean in this sentence?” (The phrase means using or taking ideas from epidemiologists.)</p></li>
<li><p>Direct students to the phrase <strong>reinvent the wheel</strong>. Ask: “What does the author mean by this phrase? What would it mean to reinvent something so common and useful? Would it be beneficial?” (The author means that researchers would be coming up with ideas that already exist. It would not be beneficial to do that.)</p></li>
<li><p>Direct students’ attention to the first question in the paragraph 2 box on their note-catchers: “In your own words, what is the “big advantage” of “raiding the epidemiologists’ toolbox?” First, ask students to discuss with their triads. Then, cold-call on students for example responses. Finally, ask students to write a response to the question on their note-catchers. Refer to the Close Read: “Conflicting Ideas” note-catcher (example for teacher reference) for sample answers.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask students to reread the sentence: “If, that is, the analogy between ideas and germs is a good one.” Ask: “Why is the word <strong>if</strong> important in this sentence? What is the concern the author is expressing in this sentence?” (The word <strong>if</strong> is important because it shows doubt by the author. The author is expressing the concern that the comparison between ideas and germs may not be a good one.)</p></li>

<tr class="even">
<td>Read paragraph 2 aloud. (cont.)</td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Direct students’ attention to the last sentence of the paragraph. Tell students that this sentence contains vocabulary they may not be familiar with, but it is possible to still get the main point of the sentence even without understanding certain words, and you will demonstrate how. Ask students to listen carefully as you reread the sentence, omitting the phrase <strong>are nebulous and insubstantial and</strong>. Read the sentence once more in this way.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “What do we learn about ideas from reading the sentence in this way?”</p></li>
<li><p>(They do not lend themselves to rigorous study.) “How does this help us understand the sentence even if we don’t know what the words <strong>nebulous</strong> and <strong>insubstantial</strong> mean?” (It shows the main point, that scientists can’t study ideas in the same way as germs.)</p></li>
<li><p>Provide students with definitions for <strong>nebulous</strong> (hazy, confused, or indistinct) and <strong>insubstantial</strong> (lacking firmness or substance; not substantial; slight).</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “In this sentence, is the author saying germs and ideas are similar or different? What phrase tells you the author’s view?” (The author is saying they are different because he or she uses the phrase <strong>unlike germs</strong>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Direct students’ attention to the questions on their note-catcher in the paragraph 2 box. Invite students to work in their triads to complete the sentence starters to describe how the author compares germs and ideas. Refer to the Close Read: “Conflicting Ideas” note-catcher (example for teacher reference) for sample responses.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “How would you describe the idea that the author develops in these two paragraphs? How is the author developing that idea?” (The author is developing the idea that it is difficult to study the spread of ideas in the same way as germs. The author is developing this idea by describing the difference between ideas and germs.) Direct students to fill in the relevant sections of their note-catchers to describe this emerging idea and how it is being developed.</p></li>

<li><p>Ask for student volunteers to identify the gist of this paragraph. “What is this paragraph mostly about?” (The author mentions a paper where people studied emails of people inviting others to join Facebook.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “How might this study serve as evidence for answering the question of how ideas spread?” (It will allow researchers to study “exactly how ‘social contagion’ works.” They can do this by using the evidence of how and why people sign up for Facebook.)</p></li>
<li><p>Invite students to work with their triads to complete their note-catchers for paragraph 3. Refer to the Close Read: “Conflicting Ideas” note-catcher (example for teacher reference) for sample responses.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “How does this information develop the emerging idea we identified in the first two paragraphs?” (It gives an example of how people might study the spread of ideas, so it shows that while it is difficult to study ideas, it is not impossible.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask students to consider whether we have enough evidence to call this emerging idea a “central idea” of the text. If so, how should we modify the wording of the central idea based on the information in this paragraph? (There is enough evidence to call this a central idea. We can add that some researchers are trying to study ideas in the same way as germs.)</p></li>
<li><p>Direct students to write the first central idea in the appropriate spot on their note-catchers. Refer to the Close Read: “Conflicting Ideas” note-catcher (example for teacher reference) for a sample response.</p></li>

<td>Read paragraphs 4 and 5 aloud.</td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Congratulate students on their work and persistence so far. Inform students that though the two sentences in paragraph 4 are complex, they can use clues in each sentence to help them understand them. Inform students that in this paragraph, the author uses the second sentence to better explain the meaning of the first sentence, and they are going to do the same.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask students to reread the first sentence in the paragraph and to underline it. Tell students that because the phrase <strong>Epidemiology-based models</strong> is an unfamiliar, domain-specific phrase, they are going to use the rest of the sentence to help them define it. Cold-call on a student to paraphrase the sentence. (Epidemiologists would say ideas spread based on how many people see them or hear about them.) Ask: “So what do you think ‘epidemiology-based models’ probably are?’ (“Epidemiology-based models” are probably just ways of understanding ideas based on epidemiology.)</p></li>
<li><p>Confirm for students that “Epidemiology-based models” and “epidemiologists’ toolbox” in the first paragraph are both ways of talking about how germs or diseases spread.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask for a student volunteer to read aloud the second sentence in the paragraph. Invite students to talk in their triads about how this sentence makes the meaning of the first sentence clearer. (It gives an example of how the flu spreads and how signing up to Facebook spreads among friends to show how epidemiology would predict the spread of ideas.)</p></li>
<li><p>Direct students’ attention to the questions on their note-catcher in the paragraphs 4 and 5 box. Invite students to work in their triads to complete the prompts for “People get the flu if” and “People sign up to Facebook if.” Refer to the Close Read: “Conflicting Ideas” note-catcher (example for teacher reference) for sample responses.</p></li>
<li><p>Draw students’ attention to paragraph 5. Point out that the author begins the first sentence with <strong>instead</strong>. Explain that this is a very important word in the article, and ask students what it is suggesting about what the author is about to say. (It suggests that the author is about to say that results are different from what researchers might expect.) Ask for a student volunteer to read aloud the first sentence of paragraph 5. Provide students with the definition of <strong>distinct</strong> in this context: <em>different or separate.</em> What point is the author making in this sentence? (that people sign up based on the number of “distinct groups”)</p></li>
<li><p>Read aloud the next two sentences. Invite students to work with their triads to fill out the prompts “People sign up for Facebook based on” and “Some examples of distinct groups in the article.” Refer to the Close Read: “Conflicting Ideas” note-catcher (example for teacher reference) for sample responses.</p></li>

<li><p>Ask: “How would you summarize this finding in the study? Does it suggest that ideas spread like germs or in their own way?” (The finding is that people are more likely to sign up to Facebook if they have friends from a lot of distinct groups rather than just more friends on it. It suggests that ideas spread in their own way rather than like germs.)</p></li>
<li><p>Pause and reflect on the importance of the information shared in this paragraph. Direct students’ attention to the space for “Central Idea 2” in the paragraphs 4 and 5 box on their note-catchers. Ask for volunteers to share out a second central idea they are noticing from the text in these paragraphs. (The study of Facebook sign-ups shows that ideas spread differently from germs.) Direct students to write the second central idea in the appropriate spot on their note-catchers.

<li><p>Tell students that now that they have identified the central ideas in the text, in the next lesson they will look more closely at the author’s argument, and what claims, evidence, and reasoning the author uses to develop the argument. Inform students that the final paragraph summarizes the author’s argument, and they will look at it in more detail in the next lesson. For now, ask students to underline the last two sentences and Turn and Talk with their partners about what the sentences mean and why the author included them. Cold-call on students to share out their responses. (The sentences are saying that ideas don’t seem to spread in the same way as diseases, so people who study ideas should come up with their own methods to study them. The author included the sentences to reinforce his or her point that ideas spread differently from germs.)</p></li>
