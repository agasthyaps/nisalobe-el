Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- SL.7.1d – Opening A: Students assess their previous experiences in acknowledging new information expressed by others and modifying their own views in text-based discussions.

- RI.7.8 – Work Time A: Students read a new article, identifying and evaluating the claims, evidence, and reasoning of the argument.

- RI.7.8. – Work Time B: Students participate in a Language Dive in which they analyze the richness of the language used to express a claim in the article “Are Social Epidemics Real?”

- SL.7.1 – Work Time C: Students engage in a text-based discussion, having come prepared with their note-catchers, following the rules for a collegial discussion, posing and responding to questions with relevant observations and ideas, and acknowledging when others express new ideas.

- SL.7.1 – Closing and Assessment A: Students track their progress on collaborative, text-based discussions.

- In this lesson, students participate in the mid-unit assessment, in which they complete a note-catcher identifying claims, evidence, and reasoning, and then analyze whether the evidence is sufficient and the reasoning is relevant. They then use this note-catcher in their text-based discussion on analyzing and evaluating the argument of the article.

- Two lessons have been allocated for this assessment to ensure sufficient time for students to analyze Argument: “Are Social Epidemics Real?” If these are taught in two separate lessons rather than together as one block, revisit the learning targets and the task at the beginning of the second 45-minute lesson to remind students of the task and purpose.

- In this lesson, the habit of character focus is on working to become effective learners and ethical people. The characteristics that students practice are respect, empathy, compassion, and taking initiative as they participate in a text-based discussion.

- After the mid-unit assessment, students reflect on their learning using the Track Progress: Collaborative Discussion recording form. This exercise is meant to provide them with time to formally keep track of and reflect on their own learning. This self-reflection supports metacognition and pride in work and learning.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release more responsibility more quickly to students as they comprehend the tasks or concepts. For example:

- Encourage students to develop their own follow-up discussion questions during Work Time A to use during their discussions.

- If using the fishbowl format for discussion, consider allowing these students to be in the inner discussion circle first, so that they can model discussion norms and analysis for other students.

- Consider video-recording exemplary discussions so that future students may learn how to achieve mastery with text-based discussions.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the lessons leading up to this one, students have practiced determining central ideas; writing objective summaries; tracing the development of ideas; identifying claims, evidence, and reasoning; determining the soundness of reasoning and the sufficiency and relevancy of evidence; and analyzing the strength of arguments.

Support All Students

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment.

- Some students may require longer than the time allocated to complete the assessment.

- Also, if using the fishbowl format for discussion, consider placing students who need more support in the outer circle for the first round of discussion, so they can observe their peers and have more time to gather their thoughts. ▲

- To support ELLs, the assessment in this lesson consists of tasks and questions in the same format as the note-catchers students have used throughout the unit thus far. This gradual release supports students in independent achievement on this assessment.

- ELLs may find it challenging to read the article and complete the note-catcher independently, even with all the practice on similar tasks throughout the unit. Remind students that they have successfully completed similar activities in class, and encourage them to do their best. Help students be mindful of the amount of time they spend on each task.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, 7.I.B.6, 7.I.C.10, 7.I.C.11, 7.I.C.12, and 7.II.C.6.

Assessment Guidance

- Assessment materials (student copy, answer key, student exemplar) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- To hear all students discuss, choose one of the following two options:

- **Fishbowl Discussion**: Divide the class in half, and arrange one group in an outer circle and one group in an inner circle. The group in the inner circle discusses the prompt for 7 minutes, then the outer group moves to the middle to discuss the prompt for 7 minutes. (Allow time for switching groups.) While in the outer circle, students must listen and take notes, so that they can use the information from both discussions to help them with their analysis in Part II of the end of unit assessment in Lesson 14.

- **Small Group Recorded Discussions**: Create groups of about five students, and provide each group with a video-recording device (a phone is sufficient). Help each group place the camera in such a way to capture all students in the discussion. (Allow time for this set-up.) Provide groups with 7 minutes for their discussion. Circulate to help with technical issues and to prompt with the follow-up discussion questions.

- When assessing and providing feedback on this assessment, use the Collaborative Discussion checklist (see Assessment Overview and Resources) to complete the Track Progress recording form. Consider making notes in the appropriate column for each criterion in a different color from student responses. Space is provided to respond to student comments. Since it can be challenging to assess all students’ conversation and analysis skills during a fast-paced discussion, have the checklist prepared and easy to use. Consider video-recording the discussions (even if using the whole-class fishbowl format) to enable multiple viewings and providing targeted feedback.

- In this assessment, students are tracking progress toward anchor standard SL.1: Prepare for and participate effectively in a range of conversations and collaborations with diverse partners, building on others’ ideas and expressing my own clearly and persuasively.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will explore a prompt and a model of an informative essay on how the ideas from one discipline can inform the ideas of another.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – SL.7.1d (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lessons 6–7**. Students may choose whether to share their ideas with a partner.

- Repeated routine: follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students that they have seen these targets before. Tell students that today they will practice these learning targets in an assessment.

Opening

B. Return End of Unit 1 Assessments with Feedback (5 minutes)

- Return students’ **End of Unit 1 Assessments with feedback**, and allow students time to review feedback and write their name on the board if they require support.

Work Time

A. Mid-Unit 2 Assessment, Part I: Read and Analyze Argument: “Are Social Epidemics Real?” (35 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can trace an argument and evaluate its strength.”

- Distribute **Mid-Unit 2 Assessment, Part I: Read and Analyze Argument: “Are Social Epidemics Real?”**

- Tell students that for this assessment, they will independently read a new article about social epidemics and identify and evaluate the claims, evidence, and reasoning as they complete a note-catcher. Then they will engage in a text-based discussion analyzing and evaluating the argument in the article.

- Read aloud the directions for each part of the assessment as students follow along. Answer clarifying questions.

- Before students begin the assessment, ask them to Think-Pair-Share:

“What value does the task of a reading assessment have for you beyond this class? Why?” (Responses will vary, but may include: this task has a lot of value for me because I will have to read and analyze text throughout high school and college.)

“What will help you succeed on this assessment?” (Responses will vary, but may include: reading carefully and completing all parts of the note-catcher will help me participate well in the discussion.)

- Direct students’ attention to the following materials:

- **Academic word wall** and **domain-specific word wall**

- **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart**

- **Print or online dictionaries**

- Remind students to refer to these materials as they read the assessment text and complete the “Are Social Epidemics Real?” argument note-catcher on the assessment.

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence. Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**, and review perseverance, taking initiative, and taking responsibility. Remind students that because they will be reading and answering questions independently for the assessment, they will need to practice these habits.

- Invite students to begin the assessment.

- Circulate to monitor and document their test-taking skills.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- After students read the article, ensure they understand it by allowing time for them to share annotations and the gists of each paragraph with a partner.

For Heavier Support

- After students read the article, ensure they understand it by allowing time for them to share annotations and the gists of each paragraph with a partner.

Work Time

B. Language Dive: “Are Social Epidemics Real?” Paragraph 3 – RI.7.8, L.7.1a (10 minutes)

- Repeated routine: follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to facilitate a Language Dive with this sentence from the assessment article:

- “These examples suggest that it only takes a few people to spread a behavior or idea, just like a disease.”

- Use the accompanying materials to facilitate the Language Dive:

- **Language Dive Guide: “Are Social Epidemics Real?” Paragraph 3 (for teacher reference)**

- **Language Dive: “Are Social Epidemics Real?” Paragraph 3 note-catcher**

- **Language Dive: “Are Social Epidemics Real?” Paragraph 3 sentence chunk strips**

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- During the Language Dive of Work Time B, students analyze the use of the word *that* to combine two clauses. Invite ELLs to remind the class what clauses are (group of words with a subject and verb). Challenge students to provide more example sentences with the word *that* combining two clauses. Teaching others helps students confirm their knowledge of language structures.

For Heavier Support

- During the Language Dive of Work Time B, some students may need additional support as they complete the sentence frame in the Practice section (**I believe that it only takes a few people to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**). Provide a bank of options from which students can select answers to complete the frame. These may include: *start a fad*, *have a good time*, *have a discussion*.

Work Time

C. Mid-Unit 2 Assessment, Part II: Text-Based Discussion: Analyze Argument: “Are Social Epidemics Real?” (25 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can follow discussion norms to have an effective text-based discussion.”

- Direct students to form the predetermined groups and organize themselves into either the fishbowl or small group discussion format. Remind students to show respect, empathy, and compassion as they follow the classroom rules for collegial discussion. They will also take initiative as they participate in a discussion. Refer to the **Work to Become Ethical People** and Work to Become Effective Learners anchor charts as necessary to review respect, empathy, compassion, and taking initiative.

- Remind students to use the following materials during their discussion:

- Argument note-catcher from Mid-Unit 2 Assessment, Part I

- “Are Social Epidemics Real?” article from Mid-Unit 2 Assessment, Part I

- **Discussion Norms anchor chart**

- **Quote Accurately from the Text handout**

- Invite students to begin the discussion, responding to the prompt, “How do the authors of the article ‘Are Social Epidemics Real?’ argue that social epidemics compare to disease epidemics? Is their evidence sufficient and relevant, and is their reasoning sound? Is their overall argument strong? Why or why not?”

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- Before the mid-unit assessment in Work Time C, challenge students to underline key vocabulary in the assessment directions and prompt as you read them aloud together as a class. Also, invite students who need lighter support to restate or clarify information for students who need heavier support. These supports ensure that students understand each task included in the assessment.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time C, read the directions for the assessment aloud slowly, twice, and also post them. This ensures that ELLs who may not be able to easily follow the language of the directions have multiple opportunities to access them.

- Display a “map” of the assessment to reference while explaining directions to the mid-unit assessment. This will reduce ambiguity and give students a clearer picture of what they can expect so that they can better allocate their time and attentional resources. Provide students with colored pencils or highlighters so that they can mark up the “map” as needed. Example:

Part I:

Part II:

Closing and Assessment

A. Track Progress – SL.7.1 (10 minutes)

- Give students specific positive feedback on their completion of the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment. (Example: “I heard a lot of you asking clarifying questions or questions to find out more.”)

- Distribute **Track Progress: Collaborative Discussion, Track Progress folders**, and several **sticky notes** to each student. Tell students that successful learners keep track of and reflect on their own learning and that they will complete a form like this after most of their assessments this year. Remind them that they did this after the End of Unit 1 Assessment.

- Tell students to use the sticky notes to find evidence of the following criteria:

- SL.7.1c

- SL.7.1d

- Guide students through completing the form. Encourage students to orally paraphrase the meaning of the Track Progress criteria, self-assess, and discuss the evidence with a partner before they begin writing.

- Invite students to place the form in their Track Progress folder, and collect students’ folders.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.

B. Read “Crime-Solving Strategies”

- Students complete Homework: Read “Crime-Solving Strategies” in preparation for the practice peer essay they will begin writing in Lesson 8.

For Lighter Support

- In addition to annotating their Homework: Read “Crime-Solving Strategies” handout for central ideas and supporting details, encourage students to use strategies to define vocabulary, take notes such as recording a gist of the paragraph, and illustrate key details in the margins.

For Heavier Support

- In addition to annotating their Homework: Read “Crime-Solving Strategies” handout for central ideas and supporting details, encourage students to use strategies to define vocabulary, take notes such as recording a gist of the paragraph, and illustrate key details in the margins.
