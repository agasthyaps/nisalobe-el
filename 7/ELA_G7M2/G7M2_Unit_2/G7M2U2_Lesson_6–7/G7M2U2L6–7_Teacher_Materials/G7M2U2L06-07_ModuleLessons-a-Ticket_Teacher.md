**Directions**: As you enter class, review the Discussion Norms anchor chart posted in your classroom. Then answer these questions:

Consider the last few discussions you’ve experienced. Have you acknowledged new information expressed by others? Checkmark yes or no:

1.  Yes \_\_\_

2.  No \_\_\_

Consider the last few discussions you’ve experienced. Have you changed your ideas during the course of a discussion, as a result of new information expressed by others? Checkmark yes or no:

3.  Yes \_\_\_

4.  No \_\_\_

If you checkmarked “yes,” describe the experience here:

Answers will vary. Sample response: Yesterday, when we were discussing the “Conflicting Ideas” article, I thought that the more people you knew on Facebook, the more likely you would be to join. My groupmate pointed out that the researchers found out something different: it was actually that the more groups you knew on Facebook, the more likely you would be to join. Weirdly, the more people you knew on Facebook wouldn’t make you more likely to join, but less likely. I didn’t understand this part of the article until my groupmate explained it to me. This changed my ideas about the article and what the researchers discovered.

If you checkmarked “no,” what might you do differently today to push your growth with this discussion skill?

Answers will vary. Sample response: I think I need to spend more time listening. Often, I get so caught up in what I’m going to say next, that I forget to listen to my groupmates. I’m going to try a strategy like asking myself, “Is this really building on others’ ideas?” before sharing my ideas. I might also count to five before jumping in so that others will talk more. If I find my ideas are changing based on what someone is saying, then I’ll jump into the conversation.
