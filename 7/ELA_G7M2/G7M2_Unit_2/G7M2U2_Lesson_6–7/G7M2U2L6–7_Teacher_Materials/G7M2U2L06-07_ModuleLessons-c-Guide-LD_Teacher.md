Language Dive Guide: “Are Social Epidemics  
Real?” Paragraph 3

RI.7.8, L.7.1a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

These examples suggest **<u>that it only takes a few people to spread a behavior or idea,</u>** just like a disease. (from paragraph 2 of “Are Social Epidemics Real?” by EL Education)

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target **(I can trace an argument and evaluate its strength.)** and RI.7.8 by analyzing the language used to express a claim. Supporting Standard: L.7.1a

- Big Idea: The sentence helps students respond to the big idea **(Epidemics can be medical or social. There are similarities and differences between medical and social epidemics.)** by inviting students to compare the way medical and social epidemics spread.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses the conjunction **that** to combine two clauses. It also uses the empty subject **it** for emphasis, allowing the author to order information by what they consider most important. Invite students to discuss each chunk briefly, but encourage extended conversation and practice with the focus structure: **that it only takes a few people to spread a behavior or idea**.

- Practice and Transfer: After discussing the focus structure, students practice using it to discuss something in their lives. Students transfer their understanding of the meaning and structure of this sentence when engaging in a text-based discussion comparing social epidemics to disease epidemics in this lesson, which is the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment.

Deconstruct

- Invite students to put their finger by this sentence from “Are Social Epidemics Real?” on their note-catchers: **These examples suggest <u>that it only takes a few people to spread a behavior or idea,</u> just like a disease.**

- Read aloud the sentence twice, and then ask students to take turns reading the sentence aloud with their partners.

- Ask:

“What does this sentence mean to you?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“How does this sentence add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

These examples suggest

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following sentence chunk: **These examples suggest**

- Ask:

“What does the phrase these examples refer to?” (the examples provided in the paragraph; the specific ideas and facts shared in this paragraph that help explain a claim)

“What does this chunk tell us about these examples?” (They suggest something; they make us think something is likely to be true. We will find out what they suggest in the next chunk.)

that it only takes a few people to spread a behavior or idea,

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **that it only takes a few people to spread a behavior or idea,**

- Underline that in green, and invite students to do the same on their note-catchers. 

- Ask:

“Can you figure out why the author started this chunk with the word that?” (That connects the upcoming chunk to the previous chunk and provides us with more information. What follows the word that will tell us what the examples suggest.)

“What do the examples suggest?” (It only takes a few people to spread a behavior or idea.)

“What does it refer to in this chunk?” (Nothing. It is used to hold the place of a subject in this clause, since the actual subject doesn’t come until later. It is acting as an empty subject, meaning it does not refer to anything mentioned elsewhere in this sentence or paragraph, as the pronoun it does.)

“What is the subject in this clause?” (to spread a behavior or idea; the act of moving a behavior or idea to affect more people)

“Why didn’t the author put the subject first, making the chunk read “to spread a behavior or idea only takes a few people,” so they didn’t have to use the empty subject it?” (Because they wanted to emphasize the information in the first part of this clause.)

- Explain that, in English, whatever comes earlier in a sentence typically has greater focus. Writers sometimes incorporate the empty subject **it** as a way to order information by what they consider to be most important.

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Invite students to practice changing the order of a sentence on their own, to better understand how order affects the focus of a sentence.

- Display the sentence frames:

**I believe that it only takes a few people \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. I believe that**

infinitive verb phrase

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ only takes a few people.**

infinitive verb phrase

- (Example: I believe that it only takes a few people **<u>to make change</u>**. I believe that **<u>to make change</u>** only takes a few people.)

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use this frame to talk with your partners about how word order affects the focus of each sentence.” (The information at the beginning of the sentence has greater focus.)

just like a disease.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **just like a disease.**

- Ask:

“What does this chunk tell us?” (According to the author, the spread of behaviors and ideas is just like, or similar to, a disease.)

“How is the spread of behaviors and ideas similar to a disease?” (It only takes a few people.)

These examples suggest that it only takes a few people to spread a behavior or idea, just like a disease.

Reconstruct

- Point to and read aloud the entire sentence on display: **These examples suggest** **<u>that it only takes a few people to spread a behavior or idea,</u>** **just like a disease.**

- Ask:

“Can we say this sentence in a different order?” (These examples suggest that, just like a disease, it only takes a few people to spread a behavior or idea.)

“What if we were to remove the word that in this sentence? How would that change the meaning?” (Removing the word that would not change the meaning. You could remove that and the sentence would still make sense. However, the word that helps clarify the link between the verb suggest and the next clause: it only takes a few people to spread a behavior or disease.)

- Cover the word **that** with your hand, and invite students to read aloud the sentence without the word **that**, demonstrating how the meaning stays the same.

“How does this sentence help us understand the author’s claim about ideas and behaviors?” (It compares the way ideas and behaviors spread with something we are familiar with \[the way a disease spreads\]).

- If productive, cue students to expand the conversation by saying more:

“Can you say more about that?” (Responses will vary.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- Ask:

“What other questions can we ask that will help us understand this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ suggest that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, just like a disease.**

subject clause

(subject + verb **suggest** + **that** + clause**,** + **just like a disease.**)

- Example: **<u>Theories</u>** suggest that **<u>ideas and emotions can be “caught,”</u>** just like a disease.

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“In your own words and with your partners, use this frame to compare behaviors and ideas to diseases.”

- Remind students that posting the chunks in language categories will help them use the language again for future speaking and writing tasks.

- Say the following, then call on volunteers:

“Now take each chunk and post it to the appropriate section of the Language Chunk Wall. You can refer to these chunks again as you speak and write.”
