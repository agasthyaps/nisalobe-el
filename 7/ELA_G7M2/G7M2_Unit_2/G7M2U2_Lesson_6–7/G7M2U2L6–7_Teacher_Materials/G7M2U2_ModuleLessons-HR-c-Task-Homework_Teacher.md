**Crime-Solving Strategies**

Perhaps you’ve seen it on television or read it in a mystery story: the detective who puts together the clues, finds the criminal, and solves the crime. It’s not always as easy as the movies make it seem. <u>But police detectives do have some tools that help them solve crimes.</u>  
For example, *detectives and their colleagues use scientific methods to examine evidence at a crime scene*. This is known as forensic science. It can help identify physical evidence such as fingerprints or DNA. *Detectives also interview witnesses and people who may know something about the crime. They gather information from people using the “shoe-leather” method, going door to door to learn more about what crimes might be happening and where. Mapping also helps detectives keep track of where crimes are happening, so they can identify patterns and look for trends. Mapping also helps them decide whether they should increase the number of police officers in a certain area. Today, detectives also use computers to keep track of criminals and analyze evidence.* These are just some of the ways detectives solve crimes. What other methods might they use in the future? For now, that’s a mystery!
