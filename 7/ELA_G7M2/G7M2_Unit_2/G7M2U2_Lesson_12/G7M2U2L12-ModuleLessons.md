Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.7.2f – Opening A: On an entrance ticket, students read and annotate a conclusion to note how it effectively follows from and supports the information presented.

- W.7.2f – Work Time A: Students use the Painted Essay® structure to more closely analyze a model conclusion and add to their understanding of an effective conclusion.

- W.7.2f– Work Time B: Students participate in a Language Dive, analyzing the meaning of a sentence from the model informative essay’s conclusion.

- L.7.1a– Work Time B: Students participate in a Language Dive, analyzing the purpose of clauses in the model informative essay’s conclusion.

- W.7.2f– Closing and Assessment A: Students draft the conclusion of their pair informative essay, ensuring that it follows from and supports the information in their essay.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners by collaborating and persevering as they write.

- The Think-Pair-Share and Think-Write-Pair-Share protocols are used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release those students who are ready to read and analyze the conclusion paragraph 2 independently and then to move on to drafting the conclusion of their practice essay with a partner rather than with teacher modeling.

- Consider having students share the conclusions to their favorite informational articles with the class. Invite students to annotate the elements of the strong conclusion, provide a title, and illustrate the conclusion in poster form, hanging these exemplar conclusions around the room.

- Use students’ conclusions found above, or find a set of informational conclusions to use. Invite students to participate in a Gallery Walk protocol in which they read a variety of conclusions posted around the room and record their notices about what makes the conclusions strong. Debrief the protocol with a synthesis discussion of how to write a strong conclusion.

- Invite students to form pairs. Using a set of informational conclusion paragraphs, have students choose a paragraph they find particularly strong. Invite students to share their notices with a partner. Have students switch partners and share a few times.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the second half of this unit, students have been analyzing a model and using their analysis to plan an essay and draft the introduction and Proof Paragraphs. This lesson continues those routines to finish writing the essay.

Support All Students

- Note there is a differentiated version of the Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 12 used in Opening A in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- In Lessons 8–12, students work with the same partner on a pair informative essay. Provide differentiated mentors by purposefully preselecting student partnerships. Consider meeting with the mentors in advance to encourage them to share their thought process with their partner. ▲

- In Work Time A, students should read the model essay paragraph and paragraph sentence strips independently. However, if some or all students need more support, read the paragraph aloud and then release students to read with their partner. Another option is for students to use technology to read the paragraph aloud, such as http://eled.org/0179 or http://eled.org/0220. ▲

- In Work Time A, students may require additional support when putting the conclusion paragraph together. If so, pair students heterogeneously for this activity, or group students who may need additional reading and organizing support together and guide them through the activity. ▲

- In Closing and Assessment A, students draft their conclusion. Some students may need to talk through their conclusion before writing it. Others may dictate their conclusion and then have a teacher, student, or technology record their dictation. Some students may need a movement break, snack, or drink of water before beginning to write. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson includes use of manipulatives to understand the key structures of a conclusion. Also, the collaboration of writing a peer essay supports students.

- ELLs may find it challenging to generate language for writing their conclusion. Encourage students to use oral processing and their home language to assist them in articulating their ideas.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.C.10, and 7.II.C.6.

Assessment Guidance

- Circulate to monitor students’ work organizing the sentences in the conclusion. If many made a similar error, teach it whole-group as a learning opportunity and a key element to focus on with conclusion writing.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will complete the end of unit assessment, in which they draw on the learning from this and previous lessons to plan, draft, and revise an informative essay independently.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Ensure there is a copy of Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 12 at each student’s workspace.

- Cut apart the conclusion paragraph strips, and organize them using envelopes or paperclips so that each pair will have one set.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous modules to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.7.2f (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 12**, using the article **“Kindness Contagion”** and the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 12** ▲ as necessary. The differentiated entrance ticket supports students’ comprehension with a gist. Also, as necessary, draw students’ attention to the conclusion portion of the **Criteria of an Effective Informative Essay anchor chart** to show them criteria of a strong conclusion. ▲

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique to review their responses.

- Repeated routine: follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

- On Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 12, students can first orally rehearse their response to the question in pairs. This pre-thinking supports students in crafting a stronger response.

For Heavier Support

- Invite students to use the Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 12 ▲. The gist and sentence starters in this resource support students in comprehending and responding.

Work Time

A. The Painted Essay®: Sort and Color-Code the Parts of the Conclusion – W.7.2f (10 minutes)

- Move students into the same predetermined pairs as in Opening A.

- Distribute the **Organize the Model: Conclusion strips**. Tell students that each pair has been given only one part of the conclusion, and later on they will find the other parts to create a complete conclusion paragraph.

- Invite students to refer to their **Painted Essay® template** to remember the parts of a conclusion paragraph:

- Restated focus

- Reflection

- Explain that each pair needs to find a pair with the other part of the conclusion and put the two pieces together in the right order.

- Tell students that when they have finished, they will check their work against the **Model Informative Essay**.

- Invite students to begin, and circulate to support students as they find a pair with a strip that will complete the conclusion. Ask pairs whether they have the restated focus or the reflection and to explain how they know. Support students with the **Organize the Model: Conclusion strips (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Refocus whole group.

- Invite students to choral read the conclusion, and to identify the restated focus. Ask students to find sentences in the conclusion that support the information or explanation presented throughout the essay. Have students Think-Pair-Share:

“How do these sentences support the information or explanation presented throughout the essay?” (They repeat the focus statement and main points, reminding the reader of the main points and how they relate to the focus statement.)

- Then focus students on the reflection, and ask them to Think-Pair-Share:

“How does this thinking and reflecting follow from the information presented in the essay?” (The reflection starts with a statement about how computer programs are easier to predict than animal movements. This statement shows another side to the focus statement: computer programs have their limits in explaining animal behavior. Then the next two sentences repeat the focus statement, emphasizing how computer programs can still help us understand how animals move and make choices.)

“How are these two parts of the conclusion similar? How are they different?” (The first part of the conclusion and the last two sentences of the conclusion repeat the focus statement and main points. The first sentence of the reflection shows another side to the focus statement.)

- Invite students to help record the parts of a conclusion on the Criteria of an Effective Informative Essay anchor chart. Refer to the **Criteria of an Effective Informative Essay anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time A, provide students with already color-coded parts of each paragraph, so that they can focus on arranging the sentences in the order that makes the most sense.

Work Time

B. Language Dive: Model Informative Essay, Paragraph 4 – W.7.2f, L.7.1a (10 minutes)

- Repeated routine: follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to facilitate a Language Dive with the following reflection sentence from the text model essay:

- “It seems clear that computer research can help us make sense of how and why animals move.”

- Use the accompanying materials to facilitate the Language Dive:

- **Language Dive Guide: Model Informative Essay, Paragraph 4 (for teacher reference)**

- **Language Dive: Model Informative Essay, Paragraph 4 note-catcher**

- **Language Dive: Model Informative Essay, Paragraph 4 note-catcher (example for teacher reference)**

- **Language Dive: Model Informative Essay, Paragraph 4 sentence chunk strips**

For Lighter Support

- During the Language Dive of Work Time B, students analyze the concluding statement. Invite students to remind classmates what makes a concluding statement effective (reviewing the points of the essay and reflecting on them in a new way). Challenge students to remind classmates what clauses are (group of words with a subject and verb). Encourage students to provide more example sentences with the word *that* combining two clauses. Or, if students are already working confidently with the word *that* to combine clauses, ask them to review and explain passive and active voice, finding examples of both voices in the model essay. Teaching others helps students confirm their knowledge of language structures.

For Heavier Support

- During the Language Dive of Work Time B, some students may need additional support as they complete the sentence frame in the Practice section (**It seems clear that \_\_\_\_\_.**). Provide a bank of options from which students can select answers to complete the frame. These may include: *we are learning a lot in this class; we are becoming good friends; I am enjoying school*.

Closing and Assessment

A. Pairs: Draft Conclusion – W.7.2f (20 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can write the conclusion of my informative essay, restating the focus of the piece and adding a reflection.”

- Remind students that as they draft the conclusion, they should restate the focus statement, provide a reflection, and include sentences that follow from and support the information or explanation presented in the rest of the essay.

- Distribute **lined paper**. Invite students to retrieve the following materials:

<!-- -->

- **Informative Writing checklist**

- **Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer**

- **Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer** ▲

- **Pair Informative Essay**

- Texts: ***Patient Zero*** and **“Crime-Solving Strategies”**

<!-- -->

- As necessary, guide students through writing their conclusion, referencing the **Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer (for teacher reference)** as needed:

- Discuss the following characteristic on the Informative Writing checklist, adding to the Characteristics column as needed:

<!-- -->

- “W.7.2f: I have a conclusion that supports the information presented.”

<!-- -->

- Invite students to read their Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer, their introductory paragraphs, and their Proof Paragraphs from previous lessons to remind them of their focus statement and their ideas.

- Ask:

“What should your conclusion do?” (restate the focus and follow from and support the information or explanation presented throughout the essay). Have students Think-Write-Pair-Share to restate the focus of their essay, recording their ideas on the Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer. (Responses will vary, but may include: interestingly, the same techniques used to solve crimes have made it possible to get answers about disease epidemics.)

- Invite students to refer to the model essay, the Criteria of an Effective Informative Essay anchor chart, and the Informative Writing checklist, as well as the **domain-specific word wall** and **academic word walls**, to write the conclusion.

- Remind students that it is often helpful to verbally rehearse the words they will use when they write. Pairs may want to orally rehearse their ideas for their conclusion paragraph, how it will restate, reflect on, and follow from the information presented in the rest of the essay. Circulate to support students as they write.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target and the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- Challenge students to rephrase the W.7.2f criteria on the **Informative Writing Checklist** into simpler language that their peers who need heavier support can understand. Rephrasing the criteria gives students comprehension and confidence with the writing expectations.

- Encourage students to model orally rehearsing their conclusion for classmates who need heavier support. Also, challenge students to use the word *that* to combine two clauses, or an “empty subject *it*,” or passive and active voice at least once. Oral rehearsal will strengthen their writing, as will using new language structures learned in the Language Dive from Lessons 6–7.

For Heavier Support

- If students are literate in their home language, they can translate the W.7.2f criteria on the Informative Writing Checklist that their peers who need lighter support rephrased. Translating or rephrasing the criteria gives students comprehension and confidence with the writing expectations.

Homework

A. Review Note-Catchers and Articles

- To prepare for the end of unit assessment in the following lesson, students complete **Homework: Review Note-Catchers and Articles**, rereading their note-catchers and articles from Unit 2, Lessons 1–7, and taking notes.

For Lighter Support

- Allow time before the end of class for students to join with a classmate who needs heavier support to review and explain the homework assignment. Students must reread the three articles they read in Lessons 1–7 and review their note-catchers, taking new notes on a new note-catcher. This work is essential for preparing students to write their end of unit assessment essay. Reviewing and explaining the homework will ensure that students understand the task and its importance.
