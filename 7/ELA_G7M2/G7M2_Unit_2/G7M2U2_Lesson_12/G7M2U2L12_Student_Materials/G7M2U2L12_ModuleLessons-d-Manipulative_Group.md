<td>The behavior of these large groups of<br />
animals has always fascinated humans.<br />
It is only recently that scientists can<br />
use their knowledge of computer<br />
programming to understand these ideas.<br />
Using computer models, they can show<br />
how a set of simple rules can produce<br />
complex results. And they can also test<br />
what kind of information animals need to<br />
make choices.</td>

<td>Certainly, it is easier to predict what a<br />
computer will do than the behavior of a<br />
group of fish or birds. Still, there are many<br />
ways in which computer programming<br />
models help us better understand animal<br />
behavior. It seems clear that computer<br />
research can help us make sense of how<br />
and why animals move.</td>
