<td>The behavior of these large groups of<br />
animals has always fascinated humans. It<br />
is only recently that scientists can use their<br />
knowledge of computer programming to<br />
understand these ideas. Using computer<br />
models, they can show how a set of simple<br />
rules can produce complex results. And they<br />
can also test what kind of information animals<br />
need to make choices.</td>

<td>Certainly, it is easier to predict what a<br />
computer will do than the behavior of a group<br />
of fish or birds. Still, there are many ways in<br />
which computer programming models help us<br />
better understand animal behavior. It seems<br />
clear that computer research can help us make<br />
sense of how and why animals move.</td>
