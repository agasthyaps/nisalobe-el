Language Dive Guide: Model Informative  
Essay, Paragraph 4

W.7.2f, L.7.1a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

**It seems clear** that computer research can help us make sense of how and why animals move. (from paragraph 4 of Model Informative Essay by EL Education)

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target **(I can write the conclusion of my informative essay, restating the focus of the piece and adding a reflection.)** and W.7.2f by providing students with a conclusion statement that clearly restates the focus of the Model Informative Essay. Supporting Standard: L.7.1a.

- Guiding Question: The sentence helps students respond to the guiding question **(What methods and tools help people to solve epidemics?)** by inviting students to discuss how people use ideas from other fields to inform the study of epidemics.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses the introductory phrase **it seems clear** to emphasize that evidence has been presented to prove the conclusion statement to be true. **It seems clear** is a compelling phrase because it uses the empty subject it for emphasis, allowing the author to order information by what he/she considers most important. Invite students to discuss each chunk briefly, but encourage extended conversation and practice with the focus structure: **It seems clear**.

- Practice and Transfer: After discussing the focus structure, students practice using it to discuss something in their lives. Students transfer their understanding of the meaning and structure of this sentence when writing the conclusion statement of their informative essay during this lesson, and when writing the conclusion statement for the informative essay during the End of Unit 2 Assessment.

- Delivery: The focus structure practice (**It seems clear that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**) is presented out of order to provide additional context and allow for better understanding and discussion.

- Delivery: Invite students to compare this sentence with the focus statement from the previous Language Dive, which also includes an introductory phrase to emphasize that the information in the sentence is the focus of the piece.

**Time**

10 minutes

Throughout the Language Dive

Refer to the instructions provided in the first three Language Dives of Module 1.

Deconstruct

- Invite students to put their finger by this sentence from the Model Informative Essay on their note-catchers: **<u>It seems clear</u> that computer research can help us make sense of how and why animals move.**

- Read aloud the sentence twice, and then ask students to take turns reading the sentence aloud with their partners.

- Ask:

“What does this sentence mean to you?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“How does this sentence add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

It seems clear

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **It seems clear**

- Ask:

“What does this chunk tell us?” (It seems clear is used to introduce a statement, telling us there appears to be no doubt about the information that follows.)

- Display the first chunk of the focus statement in the Model Informative Essay, from the Module 2, Unit 2, Lesson 9 Language Dive: **It’s fair to say**

- Ask:

“How is this chunk similar to the first chunk in the focus statement of the Model Informative Essay, It’s fair to say?” (They are both used to introduce a statement believed to be true.)

“How are the chunks different?” (It’s fair to say expresses a general likelihood that something is true, making it a strong introductory statement; It seems clear suggests that evidence has been presented to prove that something is true, making it a strong conclusion statement.)

- If productive, cue students to expand the conversation by saying more:

“Can you say more about that?” (Responses will vary.)

- Ask:

“What does it refer to in this chunk?” (Nothing. It is acting as an empty subject, meaning it does not refer to anything mentioned elsewhere in this sentence or paragraph, as the pronoun it does.)

- Remind students of the empty subject it from the previous two Language Dives in Module 2, Unit 2: Lessons 6–7 and Lesson 9. Explain that in this chunk, **it** also does not refer to anything, but is used to emphasize that the idea that follows is important.

- Invite students to discuss in pairs what they think this sentence will tell us, that **seems clear**. Remind students this is the conclusion sentence, restating the focus of the piece. Consider displaying the focus statement to support student discussions: *It’s fair to say that the study of animal behavior has been informed by ideas from computer programming.*

that computer research can help us make sense of

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **that computer research can help us make sense of**

- Ask:

“Can you figure out why the author started this chunk with the word that?” (That connects the upcoming chunk to the previous chunk and provides us with more information. What follows the word that will tell us what seems impossible to doubt.)

“What does this chunk tell us that seems clear?” (computer research can help us make sense of something)

“What does it mean to make sense of something?” (to understand something)

- If productive, cue students to expand the conversation by saying more:

“Can you say more about that?” (Responses will vary.)

- Ask:

“Is there a word that helps us figure out the meaning of the expression make sense of?” (The word sense can mean the ability to understand something, helping us figure out that to make sense of something has to do with understanding something.)

- Invite students to discuss in pairs what they think computer research can help us **make sense of**.

how and why animals move.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following sentence chunk: **how and why animals move.**

- Ask:

“What can computer research help us make sense of?” (how and why animals move)

“What is another way to say this chunk?” (Responses will vary, but may include that animal behavior is another way to say how and why animals move.)

- If productive, cue students to listen carefully and seek to understand:

“Who can tell us what your classmate said in your own words?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Tell students they will now practice the focus structure:

“You’ve played with this chunk and figured out the meaning. Now let’s use the structure in the following sentences for our own speaking and writing.”

**It seems clear that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

dependent clause

(**It seems clear** + conjunction **that** + dependent clause.)

(Example: It seems clear that **<u>the more I learn, the more I realize I have yet to learn</u>**.)

“Use this frame to talk with your partners about something in your life.”

It seems clear that computer research can help us make sense of how and why animals move.

Reconstruct

- Point to and read aloud the entire sentence on display: **<u>It seems clear</u>** **that computer research can help us make sense of how and why animals move.**

- Ask:

“Can you figure out why the author used the phrase it seems clear to introduce the focus in the introduction of the essay?” (It seems clear helps the writer express that what follows supports the information presented throughout the essay. This is important for a conclusion sentence of an informative essay, as the purpose of the conclusion statement is to restate the focus and share that something is true based on all the information gathered.)

“What if we were to remove it seems clear? Would the sentence still make sense? What else would we have to remove or change?” (If we were to remove the phrase it seems clear, we would also have to remove the conjunction that, which connects this expression to the next part of the sentence. The sentence would then read: Computer research can help us make sense of how and why animals move. The sentence would still make sense, but it would have a different meaning. It seems clear placed at the beginning of the sentence tells us there is evidence to support the statement that follows.)

“What is the subject of this sentence?” (The clause that computer research can help us make sense of how and why animals move is the subject of the sentence.)

“Why didn’t the author put the subject at the beginning of the sentence rather than the end, making the sentence read: “That computer research can help us make sense of how and why animals move seems clear”? (Because in English, whatever comes earlier in a sentence typically has greater focus, as noted in the previous two Language Dives: Module 2, Unit 2, Lessons 6–7 and Lesson 9. The author wants to emphasize the information at the beginning of the sentence—it seems clear—giving extra focus to the fact that this sentence will tell us about something that seems impossible to doubt.)

“Who can tell us what your classmate said in your own words?” (Responses will vary.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- Ask:

“What other questions can we ask that will help us understand this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question, What methods and tools help people to solve epidemics?” (Responses will vary, but may include that people use ideas from other fields to inform the study of epidemics.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

**It seems \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ can help us make**

adjective noun phrase

**sense of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

noun phrase

(**It seems** + adjective + conjunction **that** + noun phrase + verb phrase + noun phrase.)

(Example: It seems **<u>obvious</u>** that **<u>the study of crime detection</u>** can help us make sense of epidemics.)

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use this frame to write a conclusion statement for your essay in your own words with your partner, restating the focus of your piece.”
