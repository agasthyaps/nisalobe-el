| Text                         | Main Claim                                                                                                                               |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| “Kindness Contagion”         | **Kindness is contagious and takes on new forms as it spreads.**                                                                         |
| “Conflicting Ideas”          | **Although people want to study ideas as if they were like germs, the research shows that ideas don’t spread like germs.**               |
| “Are Social Epidemics Real?” | **Social contagion is real because social epidemics spread in similar ways to diseases and because people catch behaviors from others.** |

| **Text**                     | According to this article, how do social scientists use epidemics to explain human behavior?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| “Kindness Contagion”         | **In the title, the author says that kindness can spread “like a virus.” The writer of this article talks about the experiments he and his colleagues did to examine how kindness can spread. He talks about kindness in the same way people talk about epidemics. He says kindness is “contagious” and that it “infects” people.** |
| “Conflicting Ideas”          | **Many people use ideas from medical epidemics to study the spread of ideas, but the writer says this is hard to test. Then he/she looks at a specific example of Facebook sign-ups to show that ideas don’t spread in exactly the same way as germs.**                                                                             |
| “Are Social Epidemics Real?” | **The “Law of the Few” shows how ideas spread like germs. “Mirror neuron system” shows that people infect others with their facial expressions and feelings.**                                                                                                                                                                      |
