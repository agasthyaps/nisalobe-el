**Conflicting Ideas: Ideas and Diseases Spread Differently**

Babbage Blog Apr 3rd 2012 by T.C.

\[1\] For many years marketers, pollsters and the like have been borrowing from epidemiology, the branch of medicine that deals with how diseases spread through populations. Ideas, the thinking went, spread in much the same way as a bout of flu or measles.

\[2\] There is nothing wrong with such analogies, of course, and one big advantage of raiding the epidemiologists’ toolbox is that it means that those interested in the spread of ideas rather than germs do not need to re-invent the wheel. If, that is, the analogy between ideas and germs is a good one. That has been hard to test, for, unlike germs, ideas are nebulous and insubstantial and do not lend themselves to rigorous study.

\[3\] A new paper published in the *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,* though, has managed to get around that problem to study exactly how “social contagion” works—in the form of signing up to Facebook, the social-networking behemoth. With the firm’s co-operation, a team led by Johan Ugander, a mathematician at Cornell University in New York, analysed data from the site, including a corpus of 54m e-mails sent out by users inviting friends who had not yet joined the network to do so.

\[4\] Epidemiology-based models suggest that the most important factor in determining whether an idea (in this case, to join Facebook) will spread to a given individual is how many other people the individual knows who have already been exposed to it. Just as someone is more likely to contract the flu if lots of his friends have been infected, the theory was that the more friends someone has that have signed up to Facebook, the more likely he ought to be to join.

\[5\] Instead, the researchers found that the best predictor of whether someone would join Facebook was a subtly different factor: the number of distinct groups that an individual could link up with through the site. Most people have more than one social network: a group of one’s old school friends, for instance, is likely to have little contact with one’s work colleagues, who in turn won’t have much to do with one’s extended family. The more such groups were present on Facebook, the greater the probability that an individual would join. In fact, once they had controlled for this effect, the researchers found that, if anything, users became slightly less likely to join as the number of Facebooked kith and kin rose.

\[6\] As befits a group of physical scientists, the authors do not ponder the possible psychological underpinnings of their result. And it is, admittedly, just a single study. But it suggests that ideas are sufficiently different from diseases that it might not be wise naively to apply models designed for one to probe the other. High time, then, for social psychologists to stop piggybacking on epidemiologists and work harder on their own models.
