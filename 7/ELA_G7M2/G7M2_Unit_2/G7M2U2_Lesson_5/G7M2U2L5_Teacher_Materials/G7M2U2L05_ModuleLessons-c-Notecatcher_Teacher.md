RI.7.1, RI.7.8

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** In the boxes below, record the main claim the author makes in the article, the points into which that claim is broken down, and the evidence and reasoning the author uses to support those points. If a point has multiple pieces of supporting evidence and reasoning, record them all in the boxes below the point. Then evaluate whether the evidence is relevant and sufficient and the reasoning is sound, and underline YES or NO in the right-hand column.

**Directions:** Write to answer the following prompts:

Evaluate whether the argument is strong. Are the points supported by relevant and sufficient evidence and sound reasoning? Are the author’s sources credible?

**Directions:** Underline **is** or **is not**, and complete each sentence starter.

The argument is/is not strong.

The argument is strong. It convinces me that **social scientists need to come up with their own models; the epidemiology model doesn’t work for social contagion.** The author convinces me by using relevant evidence, like **the idea that groups, as opposed to individuals, impact whether or not people sign up to Facebook.** The evidence is also sufficient because **there is evidence in each paragraph.** Lastly, the reasoning is **sound and makes sense.** The author explains how **his evidence connects to his claims.**

**  
Directions:** Record any questions you have to discuss in the text-based discussion.

> Answers will vary, but may include:
>
> In signing up for Facebook, why do different groups influence people more than number of friends?
>
> What about all the other studies we’ve read about that do show that ideas spread like germs?

| **Essay Planning:** How does this article add to your understanding of how social scientists use ideas from the study of epidemics to understand and explain human behavior?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| This article looks at **researchers who study how ideas spread**. The writer tells how **many people use ideas from medical epidemics to study the spread of ideas, but he says that this would be hard to test.** Then he looks at a specific example of **Facebook sign-ups to see how ideas really spread.** He argues that this proves that **ideas don’t spread in exactly the same way as germs, so people who study ideas need to come up with their own theories.** |
