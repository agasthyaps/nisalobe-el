| 3          | epidemiology: “For many years marketers, pollsters and the like have been borrowing from **epidemiology** . . .”                                                                                                                                                            |
| 6          | rigorous: “Ideas are nebulous and insubstantial and do not lend themselves to **rigorous** study.”                                                                                                                                                                          |

| 5          | analogy: “If, that is, the **analogy** between ideas and germs is a good one.”                                                                                                                                                                                              |
