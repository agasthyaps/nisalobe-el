(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Read the prompts, and respond to the questions.

1.  Consider a time you were given feedback and it didn’t go very well. You grew frustrated, defensive, or perhaps sad. What made that feedback experience not work for you?

The feedback experience was bad because it was all negative, and it was said in an unkind tone. It was mean.

I felt hurt and upset when someone told me, “Stop talking so much. You’re being too bossy.” I stopped adding anything to the group, and instead just doodled on my paper.

2.  Now consider a time you embraced feedback, learned, and felt a strong sense of growth mindset. What made that experience go well for you?

The feedback experience was good because it helped me to set goals and recognize where I still had work to do.

I felt cared for, listened to, and understood when my parents and my teacher had a lot of really positive, supportive things to say.

3.  What makes for good feedback, in terms of content and delivery?

Hint: Content is what is said, and delivery is how it is said.

Good feedback content is specific and helpful.

For example, it tells me what I am doing effectively so I know to keep doing it, and it also tells me what I’m not doing so well, so I know what I need to do better next time.

Good feedback delivery is kind and supportive.

For example, it provides suggestions on how I might improve.

4.  What peer critique norms must we follow today to be successful?

The norms we must follow today are be kind, be specific, be helpful, and participate because it will help our peers to improve their work.
