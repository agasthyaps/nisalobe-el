End of Unit 2 Assessment, Part II: Tuning Protocol and Revision

**Name:** **Date:**

**Directions:** Exchange your essays with your partner, and follow the Directions for Tuning Protocol (on a separate handout), focusing on giving feedback on the strength of your partner’s evidence and elaboration in Proof Paragraph 1. If time allows, you can also give feedback on the strength of your partner’s evidence and elaboration in Proof Paragraph 2. (W.7.5)

**REMEMBER:**

- Evidence is the information, details, examples, and quotes used to support a point.

- Elaboration explains the evidence and tells how it supports the point.

Once you have given and received feedback on the strength of the evidence and elaboration in Proof Paragraph 1, revise your Proof Paragraph(s) to improve your evidence and elaboration.

1.  Reread the draft of your essay.

2.  Read the feedback and consider how you can use this feedback to improve your work. You may or may not agree with all the feedback, but you should consider it and incorporate the suggestions that you agree will improve your piece.

3.  Revise your first (and, if applicable, second) Proof Paragraph to improve your evidence and evaluation, clearly marking what revisions you have made using a colored pencil.
