**Directions:** Read the following model essay, written to answer this question: **How do scientists use ideas from computer programming to understand and explain animal movement?**

Most people have probably seen the large flocks of birds in the sky moving as one. Or maybe it was the big blob of fish in the ocean all changing direction faster than we can imagine. But would they think these animals reminded them of computer programs? The comparison might seem strange. However, researchers have started using computer programs to understand how animals move. They use what they know about how computer models work to understand both the movement and choices of animals. It’s fair to say that the study of animal behavior has been informed by ideas from computer programming.

The first idea from computer programming that has informed the study of animal behavior is that a simple set of rules or commands can be used to create something pretty complex. Computer scientists know that they can program objects to do very complicated things if the individual objects follow only a few simple rules. This is how programmers can create characters in video games or movies who interact in complex ways on their own. Animal scientists have used this idea to look for “rules” of animal movement. A scientist named Dmitrii Radakov studied how fish move in large groups. He noticed that “each fish simply coordinates its movements with its neighbors” (Friederici). Fish don’t follow a leader. Instead they just copy the movements of their neighbors. If a fish sees a predator and moves away, his neighbors will copy his movements. Then, the neighbors of those fish will copy those movements. This means that even if a few fish out of a thousand see a predator coming, that is enough. This theory seemed true, but animal researchers used the principles of computer modeling to test it. They used a computer to create a program with “three simple rules” that would tell a group of objects in the program how to move. Once they put these rules in the program, the objects started moving just like a group of birds or fish. The principles of computer modelling helped Radakov prove his theory about how fish move.

Computer programming models have also helped researchers understand more precisely what animals respond to in their environment. Computer programmers can create new rules for their objects just by changing code. This flexibility can inspire animal scientists to try out different ideas about group movement. For example, one animal researcher named Daniel Pearce thought that birds in large flocks might be responding to patterns of light and dark shapes when deciding how to move. The idea is that a bird in a large flock doesn’t want to go toward the darkest shape it sees. If it did, then “looking out from the crowd would become impossible” (Brownstone). On the other hand, birds don’t want to go to the clear bright sky, either. Then they might “detach from the flock entirely” (Brownstone). So Pearce created a computer program using arrows as his objects. He wrote a rule that the arrows should keep a balance between dark and light around them. It worked. Just like birds, the arrows on his computer screen arranged themselves into a flock formation. Creating a model, just like a computer scientist, helped Pearce understand more about the movement of birds.

The behavior of these large groups of animals has always fascinated humans. Only recently have scientists used their knowledge of computer programming to understand these ideas. Using computer models, they can show how a set of simple rules can produce complex results. And they can also test what kind of information animals need to make choices. Certainly, it is easier to predict what a computer will do than the behavior of a group of fish or birds. Still, there are many ways in which computer programming models help us better understand animal behavior, including how and why animals move.
