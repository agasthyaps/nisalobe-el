Track Progress: Informative Writing

**Name:** **Date:**

**Learning Target:** I can write an informative text.

**Standard I’m Tracking:** W.7.2

1.  How am I doing?

- For each criterion, self-assess by putting a check mark in the appropriate column.

- Write the number of each standard on a sticky note or flag. Then, in your own writing, place each sticky note in an area that shows evidence you have met that criterion. Make sure you have evidence for each criterion.

- Strive to be honest with yourself. Remember, your ability grows with your effort, so it’s fine if you aren’t there yet!

You will receive feedback on different colored sticky notes/flags, and in a different colored pen on the checklist.
