(For Teacher Reference)

**Focus Question:**

How do social scientists use ideas from the study of epidemics to understand and explain human behavior?

**Focus**

What is the main idea of your piece?

(What is your essay mostly about?)

It’s fair to say that the study of social behavior has been informed by ideas from epidemiology.

**Introduction**

How will you catch the reader’s attention?

(How will you interest your reader?)

General statement to which many readers can relate: most people would probably admit that their friends and family influence what they do and how they feel.

What context do you need to give your reader?

(What important information does your reader need to know?)

I need to present and define the terms epidemic and social contagion. I need to tell how some researchers think social epidemics are like medical epidemics.

Write your focus statement.

It’s fair to say that the study of social behavior has been informed by ideas from epidemiology.

What are the main points you will be making to support this focus statement?

Point 1: Social/medical epidemics can often be traced back to a common source.

Point 2: Epidemiology has helped researchers think about how people “catch” behaviors.

**  
Proof Paragraph(s) for Point 1**

What is the first point that supports your focus statement?

Social/medical epidemics can often be traced back to a common source.

**Evidence**

What evidence from the texts supports this point?

**Evidence** is events, quotes, or information from the texts.

- **Hush Puppy shoes**

- **“Law of the Few”**

- **Stanley Milgrim’s sidewalk experiment**

How does this evidence support this point?

This evidence shows that a few kids wearing shoes or a few people looking up at a window can get other people to do the same. This is “The Law of the Few” and is like patient zero in a medical epidemic.

**Proof Paragraph(s) for Point 2**

What is the next point that supports your focus statement?

Epidemiology has helped researchers think about how people “catch” behaviors.

**Evidence**

What evidence from the texts supports this point?

**Evidence** is events, quotes, or information from the texts.

- **We have a “mirror neuron system” (EL Education).**

- **allows us to practice others’ behaviors just by watching them (EL Education)**

- **“Kindness Contagion” pen-pal and donation experiments**

How does this evidence support this point?

This evidence shows that just like germs, these emotions seem to “spread” to others, and behaviors sometimes changed as they spread. Using a theory of contagion, just like epidemiologists, helped Zaki understand human behavior.

**  
Conclusion**

Restate your focus statement from the introduction.

The study of epidemics is helpful in understanding human behavior.

What are your further reflections on this topic?

(What other thoughts do you have about this topic?)

It is important to keep in mind that the thoughts, emotions, and behaviors are not exactly like epidemics. The writer of the article “Conflicting Ideas” cautions that “it might not be wise” to compare behaviors to diseases. He or she is right that it is easier to understand how a germ spreads from person to person than how a thought or emotion spreads. Still, there are a lot of examples of how studying epidemics has helped us better understand social behavior. It seems clear that these studies will continue to help us make sense of behavior and emotions in the future.
