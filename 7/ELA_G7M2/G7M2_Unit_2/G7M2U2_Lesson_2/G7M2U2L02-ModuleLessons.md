Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.7.8 – Opening A: Students define vocabulary relevant to tracing and evaluating arguments on an entrance ticket.

- RI.7.8 – Work Time B: Students work in pairs to analyze the argument in “Kindness Contagion.”

- SL.7.1 – Closing and Assessment A: Students engage in a collaborative discussion about the argument in “Kindness Contagion.”

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become ethical people by showing respect as they reflect on how emotions and behaviors can spread between people, and on working to become effective learners by collaborating as they work in triads throughout the lesson.

- This lesson is the first that includes built-out instruction for the use of Goal 3 Conversation Cues. Conversation Cues are questions that promote productive and equitable conversation (adapted from Michaels, Sarah and O’Connor, Cathy. Talk Science Primer. Cambridge, MA: TERC, 2012. http://inquiryproject.terc.edu/shared/pd/TalkScience_Primer.pdf. Based on Chapin, Suzanne, et al. Classroom Discussions: Using Math Talk to Help Students Learn, Grades K–6. 2nd ed., Math Solutions Publications, 2009). Goal 3 Conversation Cues encourage all students to talk and be understood. To review the complete set of cues, refer to Overview–Conversation Cues in the K–5 Language Arts Curriculum section of the Tools Page (http://eled.org/tools). Provide students with a thinking journal or scrap paper. Examples of the Goal 3 Conversation Cues are (with expected responses):

- To help students provide reasoning or evidence:

“Why do you think that?”

“Because \_\_\_\_\_.”

“What in the sentence/text makes you think so?”

“If you look at \_\_\_\_\_, it says \_\_\_\_\_, which means \_\_\_\_\_.”

- To help students challenge their thinking:

“What if \_\_\_\_\_ (that word were removed/the main character had done something different/we didn’t write an introduction)? I’ll give you time to think and discuss with a partner.”

“If we did that, then \_\_\_\_\_.”

“Can you figure out why \_\_\_\_\_ (the author used this phrase/we used that strategy/there’s an - *ly* added to that word)? I’ll give you time to think and discuss with a partner.”

“I think it’s because \_\_\_\_\_.”

- To help students think about thinking:

“What strategies/habits helped you succeed? I’ll give you time to think and discuss with a partner.”

“\_\_\_\_\_ helped me a lot because \_\_\_\_\_.”

“How does our discussion add to our understanding of \_\_\_\_\_ (previously discussed topic/text/language? I’ll give you time to think and discuss with a partner.”

“I used to think that \_\_\_\_\_, and now I think that \_\_\_\_\_.”

- Conversation Cues are similar to discussion norms in that they seek to foster productive and collaborative conversation. Furthermore, Conversation Cues aim to ensure equitable conversation by gradually building students’ capacity to become productive, collaborative participants. Goal 3 Conversation Cues focus on guiding students to deepen their thinking, to thinking with others. (SL.7.1b) ▲

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Ask those partners who more quickly identify evidence and reasoning to join with struggling pairs to help them identify evidence and reasoning.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students continued building their background knowledge about social contagion by reading “Kindness Contagion” for central ideas. In this lesson, students return to the article to begin tracing the argument the author is making. This will allow students to engage more deeply with the text and the ideas it develops and build a foundation for further analysis in upcoming lessons.

Support All Students

- The subject matter in this excerpt includes mentions of homelessness and ungenerous behavior. Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this chapter that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually.

- Note there is a differentiated version of the Argument: “Kindness Contagion” note-catcher used in Work Time B in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Students may need additional support with recording their answers on their note-catchers. Consider grouping those students together for additional support when necessary. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson includes a read-aloud and review of the complex text read in the previous lesson and in preparation for further analysis in this lesson. Other supports include teacher-guided analysis of the argument in the “Kindness Contagion” article.

- ELLs may find it challenging to analyze the argument in a complex text. In addition to the supports suggested below, ensure students who need heavier support are paired with students who need lighter support.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, 7.I.B.6, and 7.I.C.11.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Close Reading note-catchers to ensure they understand how to trace and evaluate the author’s arguments.

- During the discussion, monitor students’ use of the Conversation Cues, which allow them to gather more information from their peers.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue to analyze the argument in “Kindness Contagion,” moving on to evaluating the evidence and reasoning, as well as the validity of the argument overall. This work will prepare them for the mid-unit assessment, when they will do the same for a new article.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.7.4 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 2**. For students who need more support completing the entrance ticket, allow them to use online, print, ELL, or translation **dictionaries** to define the argument terms. ▲

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique to review their responses. Then add *argument*, *claim*, *point*, *evidence*, and *reasoning* to the **academic word wall** with translations in home languages where appropriate, and invite students to add the words to their **vocabulary logs**. Then ask students to Turn and Talk about how these terms relate to one another. Invite volunteers to share their ideas, and explain that the class will examine how these terms relate in the following activity.

- Repeated routine: follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read Aloud “Kindness Contagion” (10 minutes)

- Explain that students will hear the article **“Kindness Contagion”** read aloud again. Although they analyzed this article in the previous lesson, it is important to reread and reconsider their understanding of complex texts. Ask students to retrieve their copies of the article and their **Close Read: “Kindness Contagion” note-catcher**.

- Read aloud “Kindness Contagion” as students follow along. Pause after each paragraph to have students Turn and Talk about the gist of the paragraph and important vocabulary. Invite students to refer to their Close Read: “Kindness Contagion” note-catcher for support with comprehending the article.

- Gists:

- Paragraph 1: Kindness is contagious and changes as it spreads.

- Paragraph 2: Conformity is both good and bad.

- Paragraph 3: Kindness changes as it spreads.

- Paragraph 4: People donate money in a study.

- Paragraph 5: Pen pal task proves kindness changes.

- Paragraph 6: People donate even when hearing about good behavior.

- Paragraph 7: Kindness might spread because people like being on same page as others.

- Paragraph 8: A reminder that conformity can also be bad.

- Paragraph 9: We should emphasize positivity to help kindness spread.

Work Time

B. Analyze Argument: “Kindness Contagion” – RI.7.8 (20 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify the main claim, points, evidence, and reasoning in a text.”

- Ask students to recall what the text was about, specifically the central ideas they identified in the previous lesson and how they relate to one another. (The article is about how conformity can be good or bad, but positive conformity can spread both through specific actions and in broader ways.)

- Tell students that over the next two lessons they will further examine how the author constructs the text as an argument. Remind students that the word *argument* has two meanings. Explain that rather than the common use of the word *argument* or *fight*, this article is a “thinking argument” in which the author is not actually fighting with anyone but sharing his views with the reader about a topic he has learned and thought about a lot, enough to decide his own viewpoint. When he writes an argument about that topic, the writer is sharing his thinking with readers in a logical way. Explain that to do this, the author uses certain tools in his writing, and those tools are what they are going to examine in these next two lessons.

- Ask students to take out their copies of the “Kindness Contagion” article. Display and distribute the **Argument: “Kindness Contagion” note-catcher** and the **Argument: “Kindness Contagion” note-catcher** ▲ as necessary. The differentiated note-catcher supports students’ writing and analysis with sentence frames. ▲

- Explain the design of the note-catcher and how each of the boxes will help students understand and gather evidence about the tools that authors use for arguments. The box for “Main Claim” allows students to capture the overall claim or statement the author makes about how kindness spreads. The spaces for “Points” are for recording the points he makes to support his main claim. The boxes for “Evidence” are for collecting the facts, quotes, or other information the author uses to support his points. “Reasoning” allows students to describe how the author makes connections among the pieces of evidence as well as to explain how they apply to the point and the main claim. In the following lesson, once students have listed all the evidence for a point, they can assess whether it’s sufficient and relevant, underlining yes or no in the right-hand column. Then students can assess if the reasoning is sound, or makes sense, by underlining yes or no in the right-hand column.

- Tell students that in this lesson, they will identify the main claim, two points, and the evidence and reasoning that support the points. Students will have the opportunity to discuss these points and the supporting evidence with their peers. In the following lesson, students will learn to evaluate the evidence and reasoning and make a judgment about the argument overall.

- Check students’ comprehension of argument terms and the note-catcher by asking them to Think-Pair-Share:

“What is an argument? How do the main claim, points, evidence, and reasoning relate to create an argument?” (An argument is made up of a main claim or statement about a topic that an author proves with points he supports with evidence and reasoning.)

- Confirm that an argument has a main claim, like a central idea, with points that support or explain the claim, and evidence and reasoning that support the points.

- Ask:

“What is the main claim the author makes in this article? (The main claim is that kindness is contagious and takes on new forms as it spreads.) If students struggle to identify the main claim, encourage them to retrieve their Close Read: “Kindness Contagion” note-catcher and consider the central ideas they identified in the previous lesson. ▲”

- See the **Argument: “Kindness Contagion” note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** to guide students in adding this claim to their note-catcher.

- Ask:

“What are the different points this claim is broken down into? What does the author need to prove in order to support the main claim?” (Kindness is contagious. Kindness can take on new forms as it spreads.)

- Invite students to record these points in the appropriate boxes on their note-catcher.

- Ask:

“What is one piece of evidence the author uses to support the first point?” (Answers will vary, but may include: People “boost” their own giving when told about others’ donations. The researchers found that “participants who believed others were generous became more generous themselves.” People value “being on the same page with others.”)

- Invite students to note this evidence in the appropriate box on their note-catcher. Explain that sometimes the evidence and reasoning for one point can be found in another paragraph.

- Explain that it is not enough for the writer of an argument to provide the evidence for a point. For an argument to be convincing, it must be clear how the evidence supports the point. Authors show this support through reasoning, either by stating exactly how a piece of evidence relates to a point, or by implying it in their writing.

- Have students Turn and Talk with a partner about what reasoning the author uses to tie the evidence together and support the first point.

- Ask for volunteers to share out their responses to these questions:

“What is the relationship between the evidence the author presents to support this first point that kindness is contagious? How does it relate to the point and the main claim?” (The evidence gives examples where people imitated generous actions of others and explains why this might happen. This provides proof that kindness is contagious, and supports the first half of the main claim.)

- Encourage students to record this reasoning in the correct box. See the Argument: “Kindness Contagion” note-catcher (for teacher reference) for model answers.

- Tell students that they will spend the next lesson delving into the questions of whether the evidence is relevant and sufficient and the reasoning is sound. Today, after identifying evidence and reasoning with their peers, they will practice a whole-class discussion based on their learning.

- Invite students to work in small groups or pairs to identify evidence and reasoning that support the other point in the argument. Circulate and support as necessary.

- After several minutes, ask for volunteers to share out their ideas about the evidence and reasoning. See the Argument: “Kindness Contagion” note-catcher (for teacher reference) as necessary for model answers.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time B, challenge students to work with classmates who need heavier support to write the main claim on a strip of paper and cut it into the two points. Then they can write the evidence and reasoning on strips of paper or cards and arrange them below the point they support. Assisting their classmates with creating and arranging manipulatives will cement their understanding of the argument components.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time B, have students work with classmates who need lighter support to write the main claim on a strip of paper and cut it into the two points. Then they can write the evidence and reasoning on strips of paper or cards and arrange them below the point they support. Creating and arranging manipulatives will increase their understanding of the argument components.

- During Work Time B, invite students to use the **Argument: “Kindness Contagion” note-catcher** ▲. This resource supports students’ writing and analysis with sentence frames.

Closing and Assessment

A. Discuss Argument: “Kindness Contagion” – SL.7.1 (10 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can ask my classmates to explain their thinking.”

“I can explain my own thinking.”

- Remind students of their work generating discussion norms as a class in Unit 1. Refer students to the **Discussion Norms anchor chart**, and ask them to Think-Pair-Share to generate questions they can ask to learn why their classmates think something. (Why do you think that? What in the text makes you think so?) Add student responses to the Discussion Norms anchor chart, in the “Cues” column.

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share on responses they could make to these new questions or cues. (Because . . . If you look at . . . it says, “ . . . ”) Add student responses to the Discussion Norms anchor chart, in the “Responses” column. Refer to **Discussion Norms anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Share with students any of the Conversation Cues listed on the example anchor chart that they have not yet arrived at as a group, and inform students that these Conversation Cues can be used to help one another ask for more information from peers.

- Tell students that they will have a chance to practice these cues today as well as the ones they identified in Module 1 as they engage in a discussion about the article “Kindness Contagion.”

- Ask students to Turn and Talk with a partner about which cues they find most useful in engaging their peers and how they can incorporate those into discussion. (Responses will vary.)

- Inform students that they will now engage in a whole-class discussion about the claims, evidence, and reasoning they identified as a class and with their partners. Tell students that this discussion should provide good opportunities to ask clarifying questions of one another and to inquire as to why their peers made certain statements during the discussion. Encourage students to write new learning in their note-catchers as they discuss with peers.

- Remind students to also use the Conversation Cues they identified to expand conversation and ask peers for more information.

- To guide discussion, ask questions such as:

“What is the overall argument of the article? What is the main claim in this argument? What are the points the author makes, and how does he support the points? What evidence and reasoning does the author use to support his points?” (See the Argument: “Kindness Contagion” note-catcher \[example for teacher reference\] as necessary for model answers.)

- Monitor class discussion, and highlight the use of relevant Conversation Cues.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets and the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- Before beginning the whole-class discussion, post the prompts listed in the lesson and challenge students to orally rehearse with a partner responses to each prompt. Rehearsal gives students confidence with language structures they can use in their discussions.

For Heavier Support

- Before beginning the whole-class discussion, post the prompts listed in the lesson and provide students with the following sentence starters.

- The overall argument of the article is . . .

- The main claim in this argument is . . .

- One point the author makes is . . .

- He supports this point with evidence/reasoning such as . . .

- Another point the author makes is . . .

- Allow time for students to complete the sentence starters in writing and orally rehearse their statements with a partner. Writing down and practicing sentences they can use in a discussion gives students confidence to increase their successful participation.

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.

For Lighter Support

- Allow time at the end of class for students to share with a partner the independent research reading book they are reading. Sharing their reading will ensure students are engaged with their book and give them an opportunity to find a different one if they are no longer interested in their choice.

For Heavier Support

- Allow time at the end of class for students to share with a partner the independent research reading book they are reading. Sharing their reading will ensure students are engaged with their book and give them an opportunity to find a different one if they are no longer interested in their choice. Also, as necessary, review the purpose of independent research reading. Emphasize the benefits of reading multiple texts on the same topic (e.g., repeated exposure to relevant vocabulary).
