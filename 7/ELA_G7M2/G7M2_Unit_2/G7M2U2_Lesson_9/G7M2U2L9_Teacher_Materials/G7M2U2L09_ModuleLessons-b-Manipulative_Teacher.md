| Most people have probably seen the large flocks of birds in the sky moving as one. Or maybe it was the big blob of fish in the ocean all changing direction faster than we can imagine. But would they think these animals reminded them of computer programs? The comparison might seem strange. |
| However, researchers have started using computer programs to understand how animals move.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| They use what they know about how computer models work to understand both the movement and choices of animals.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| It’s fair to say that the study of animal behavior has been informed by ideas from computer programming.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
