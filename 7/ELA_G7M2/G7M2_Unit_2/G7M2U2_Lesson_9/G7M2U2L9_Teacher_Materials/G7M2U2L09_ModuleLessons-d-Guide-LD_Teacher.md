Language Dive Guide: Model Informative  
Essay, Paragraph 1

W.7.2a, L.7.1a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

It’s fair to say **that the study of animal behavior has been informed by ideas** from computer programming. (from paragraph 1 of Model Informative Essay: “Computer Programs and Animal Behavior” by EL Education)

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target **(I can write an introduction for my essay giving context on social epidemics and clearly stating the focus of the piece.)** and W.7.2a by providing students with an example of a focus statement that clearly states a focus from the Model Informative Essay. It also helps to address L.7.1a, by inviting students to explore the function of the clause **that the study of animal behavior has been informed**.

- Guiding Question: To help students respond to the guiding question **(What methods and tools help people to solve epidemics?)**, this sentence invites students to discuss how people use ideas from other fields to inform the study of epidemics.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it is written in the passive voice to place emphasis on the object of the sentence. It also uses the present perfect verb tense (**has been informed**) to express actions that started in the past and continue until now. Invite students to discuss each chunk briefly, but encourage extended conversation and practice with the focus structure: **that the study of animal behavior has been informed by ideas**. Based on student need and time, consider adding days for extended conversation and practice with a new focus structure: **It’s fair to say**.

- Practice and Transfer: After discussing the focus structure, students practice using it to discuss something in their lives. Students transfer their understanding of the meaning and structure of this sentence when writing the focus statement of their informative essay during this lesson, and when writing the focus statement for the informative essay during the End of Unit 2 Assessment.

**Key**

Red

Deconstruct

- Invite students to put their finger by this sentence from Model Informative Essay on their note-catchers: **It’s fair to say <u>that the study of animal behavior has been informed by ideas</u> from computer programming.**

- Read aloud the sentence twice, and then ask students to take turns reading the sentence aloud with their partners.

- Ask:

“What does this sentence mean to you?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“How does this sentence add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

It’s fair to say

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **It’s fair to say**

- Ask:

“What does this chunk tell us?” (It’s fair to say is an expression used in English to introduce a statement believed to be true.)

- If productive, cue students to expand the conversation by saying more:

“Can you say more about that?” (Responses will vary.)

- Ask:

“Is there a word that helps us figure out the meaning of this expression?” (The word fair means reasonable or acceptable, helping us figure out that this expression introduces something that is reasonable or has been accepted as truth.)

- Ask:

“What does it refer to in this chunk?” (Nothing. It is acting as an empty subject, meaning it does not refer to anything mentioned elsewhere in this sentence or paragraph, as the pronoun it does.)

- Remind students of the empty subject “**it**” from the previous Language Dive in Module 2, Unit 2, Lessons 6–7. Explain that in this chunk, **it** also does not refer to anything, but is used to emphasize that the idea that follows is important.

- Invite students to discuss in pairs what they think this sentence will tell us, that is **fair to say**. Students can refer to the model essay prompt (*How do scientists use ideas from computer programming to understand and explain animal movement?*) to support their discussion.

that the study of animal behavior has been informed by ideas

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **that the study of animal behavior has been informed by ideas**

- Ask:

“What does this chunk tell us about what is likely to be true?” (the study of animal behavior has been informed by ideas)

- Explain that this sentence is written in passive voice, which means the object of the sentence comes first (the study of animal behavior), and is the thing that receives the action. The subject, which does the acting (ideas), comes after the verb. To identify passive voice, look for a form of **to be** (**is**, **are**, **am**, **was**, **has been**, **have been**, **had been**, **will be**, **will have been**) followed by a past participle, which is a form of the verb that typically ends in **-ed**. (Form of **to be** + past participle = passive voice.)

- Underline has been informed in red, and invite students to do the same on their note-  
  catchers. 

- Ask:

“What if we were to replace has been with was? How would that change the meaning?” (Replacing has been with was would tell us that the study of animal behavior was informed by ideas from something at a certain point in the past, but is no longer informed by them. Has been informed is written in the present perfect verb tense to tell us that the study of animal behavior started to be informed by something in the past, and continues to be informed by the same thing today.)

- If productive, cue students to expand the conversation by saying more:

“Can you say more about that?” (Responses will vary.)

- Ask:

“What has the study of animal behavior been informed by?” (ideas; we will find out more about the ideas in the subsequent chunk)

- Explain that, when using passive voice, the subject usually appears at the end of the sentence after the word **by**, if it appears at all.

- Display the following chunk, rewritten in active voice, to demonstrate how switching word order changes the chunk from passive to active voice: **ideas have informed the study of animal behavior**

- Ask:

“To create active voice, what did we have to remove or change?” (We removed the word been \[form of to be used to identify passive voice\] and the preposition by; we changed the word order to put the subject \[ideas\] before the verb, and the object \[the study of animal behavior\] after the verb; and we changed has to have for subject/verb agreement.)

“Does the meaning change when we switch from passive to active voice?” (Yes, in passive voice, this chunk emphasizes the object receiving the action \[the study of animal behavior\], while active voice emphasizes the subject \[ideas\]. The author might use passive voice because he or she believes the result is more important than the means.)

- If productive, cue students to listen carefully and seek to understand:

“Who can tell us what your classmate said in your own words?” (Responses will vary.)

- Invite students to discuss in pairs what ideas they think the study of animal behavior **has been informed by**.

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Tell students they will now practice the focus structure:

“You’ve played with this chunk and figured out the meaning. Now let’s use the structure in the following sentences for our own speaking and writing.”

**It’s fair to say that my habits of character have been informed by \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

\[noun phrase\]

(Introductory phrase + conjunction **that** + noun phrase + present perfect form of **to be** + past participle + preposition **by** + noun phrase.)

(Example: It’s fair to say that my habits of character have been informed by <u>actively learning from others</u>.)

- Invite students to change this sentence from passive to active voice by switching the word order.

**It’s fair to say that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ has/have informed my habits of character.**

\[noun phrase\]

(Introductory phrase + conjunction **that** + noun phrase + present perfect verb tense + noun phrase.)

(Example: It’s fair to say that **<u>actively learning from others</u>** has informed my habits of character.)

“Use this frame to talk, in your own words and with your partners, about how your habits of character have been informed. Discuss how the meaning of the sentence changes when you switch from passive to active voice.” (The emphasis is placed on what comes first in the sentence. In the first sentence, my habits of character are emphasized, whereas in the second sentence the noun phrase informed the habits of character is emphasized.)

from computer programming.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following sentence chunk: **from computer programming.**

- Ask:

“What ideas has the study of animal behavior been informed by?” (the ideas from computer programming)

- If productive, cue students to expand the conversation by giving an example:

“Can you give an example?” (Responses will vary.)

- Invite students to reference the upcoming paragraphs in the Model Informative Essay to discuss examples of ideas from computer programming that have informed the study of animal behavior.

It’s fair to say that the study of animal behavior has been informed by ideas  
from computer programming.

Reconstruct

- Point to and read aloud the entire sentence on display: **It’s fair to say** **<u>that the study of animal behavior has been informed by ideas</u>** **from computer programming.**

- Ask:

“Can you figure out why the author used the expression it’s fair to say to introduce the focus in the introduction of the essay?” (It’s fair to say helps the writer clearly state that what follows will be the focus of the essay and what they will work to prove throughout the rest of the piece.)

“What if we were to remove the phrase it’s fair to say? Would the sentence still make sense? What else would we have to remove or change?” (If we were to remove the phrase it’s fair to say, we would also have to remove the conjunction that, which connects this expression to the next part of the sentence. The sentence would then read: The study of animal behavior has been informed by ideas from computer programming. The sentence would still make sense, but the statement wouldn’t be as strong. The idiom it’s fair to say amplifies, or strengthens, the emphasis that this statement is likely to be true.)

- Invite students to discuss in pairs why they think the author wanted to amplify, or strengthen, the emphasis that this statement is likely to be true. (Responses will vary, but may include that the author wanted to emphasize this statement to make it clear it is the focus statement, introducing the focus of this essay.)

“Why didn’t the author put the subject first and write in active voice, making the sentence read “It’s fair to say that ideas from computer programming have informed the study of animal behavior?” (Because he or she wanted to emphasize the information in the first part of this clause: that the study of animal behavior has been informed by something.)

- If productive, cue students to listen carefully and seek to understand:

“Who can tell us what your classmate said in your own words?” (Responses will vary.)

- Remind students that, in English, whatever comes earlier in a sentence typically has greater focus, as noted in the previous Language Dive (Module 2, Unit 2, Lessons 6–7). Explain that sometimes authors use passive voice for this reason.

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- Ask:

“What other questions can we ask that will help us understand this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question: ‘What methods and tools help people to solve epidemics’?” (Responses will vary, but may include that people use ideas from other fields to inform the study of epidemics.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frames:

**It’s fair to say that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ has/have been informed by \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

noun phrase noun phrase

(Introductory phrase + conjunction **that** + noun phrase + present perfect form of **to be** + past participle + preposition **by** + noun phrase.)

(Example: It’s fair to say that **<u>epidemiologists</u>** have been informed by **<u>ideas from the study of crime detection</u>**.)

**It’s fair to say that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ has/have informed \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

noun phrase noun phrase

(Introductory phrase + conjunction **that** + noun phrase + present perfect verb tense + noun phrase.)

(Example: It’s fair to say that **<u>ideas from the study of crime detection</u>** have informed **<u>epidemiologists</u>**.)

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use one of these frames to write a focus statement for your essay in your own words with your partner, responding to the essay prompt: How do epidemiologists use ideas from the study of crime detection to understand and explain epidemics?”

- Invite students to choose one of the sentence frames above, choosing either active or passive voice for their focus statement. Invite them to explain why they chose the one they did, allowing them to distinguish between the meaning of active and passive voice.
