![](media/image1.png) Guiding Questions and Big Ideas

What are epidemics? How do they develop?

- *Epidemics can be medical or social. There are similarities and differences to epidemics, depending on whether they are social or medical in nature.*

- *Social epidemics can be positive or negative.*

- *Epidemics spread through contagion as well as social networks.*

How do people respond to an epidemic?

- *People’s response to epidemics affects their overall impact. When people respond with positive character traits and logic, epidemics can be contained. When people respond with fear and selfishness, epidemics often spread.*

What is the role of character and mindset in solving epidemic crises?

- *Epidemiologists can respond to epidemics with integrity, initiative, responsibility, and perseverance. Doctors or caregivers can respond to patients with compassion, respect, and empathy.*

What methods and tools help people to solve epidemics?

- *People use logic, the scientific method, and innovation to solve mysterious epidemics.*

What will your student be doing at school?

In Unit 2, students transfer the knowledge about how scientists think about and investigate medical epidemics to the study of social epidemics. Some social epidemics students explore are how kindness can be contagious and how emotions and trends spread from person to person. Students explore the topic of social epidemics through various articles that describe the basic terms and theories behind social and emotional contagion. Students practice summarizing the central ideas of the articles as well as analyzing their arguments. In small groups, students participate in discussions in preparation for the mid-unit assessment, a text-based discussion in which students evaluate whether the authors of an article have provided sufficient evidence and reasoning for their claims connecting social and disease epidemics.

In the second half of the unit, students learn and practice the skills necessary for completing their end of unit assessment, an informative essay that answers the question: how do social scientists use ideas from the study of epidemics to understand and explain human behavior? Students engage in the full writing process, from planning to drafting to peer critique to revision. By the end of the unit, students have the skills and knowledge to think critically about the latest research about how emotions, ideas, and behaviors spread. This prepares them for further investigation of the topic in Unit 3, as they engage in their own research and develop a podcast script related to a social or disease epidemic.

Throughout the unit, students continue to focus on respect, empathy, and compassion as they respond to one another’s ideas and skills in written work and in discussions. Students also practice collaboration and taking initiative during discussions. They practice integrity and perseverance as they work independently on assessments. And they take responsibility for their own learning as they track progress on their assessments.

In this unit, students continue to read nonfiction texts at their level as they choose independent research reading texts. Students should complete 20 minutes of independent research reading for homework when they are not reading a chapter from the anchor text. Students should also continue independent research reading over weekends.

How can you support your student at home?

Talk with your student about social epidemics or how ideas, behaviors, and emotions spread among people.

Read books and articles with your student. Discuss the central ideas and the arguments and whether the evidence is relevant and sufficient and the reasoning sound. You may use questions such as the following for your conversations:

- What are the main ideas in this book or article?

- How does the author say ideas spread?

- What evidence do the authors use to support their claims or points? Is the evidence relevant or related to the claim? Is the evidence sufficient (is there enough)?

- Is the reasoning sound? (Do the authors make sense when they explain how the evidence supports the points?)

Unit 2: Homework

In Lessons 1 and 4, students finish the classwork of writing summaries of the articles they read in class. Then they use context and, if necessary, a dictionary to determine the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary in the articles.

In Lessons 2–3, 6–11, and 13–15, homework focuses on research reading for which students read a topic-related book of choice and answer a question related to the unit’s ideas and skills.

In Lessons 3 and 5, students fill out the section on their argument note-catchers about how the author is making connections between medical and social epidemics in the article they read in class.

In Lesson 5, students set character and academic goals and make plans for achieving them in the text-based discussion in the following lesson.

In Lessons 5 and 12, students reread the note-catchers they’ve completed in previous lessons to prepare for the assessment in the following lesson.

Independent Reading

**Directions:** Remember to record responses to research reading in the front of your independent reading journal and responses to choice reading in the back. Try to choose a different prompt each time.

Record any new vocabulary in your vocabulary log. Underline vocabulary found during independent reading.

Record:

- Date

- Title and author of your reading book

- Pages you have read

- Prompt

- Response

Example:

<u>Date:</u> 02/17/19

<u>Book Title and Author:</u> “Kindness Contagion”

<u>Pages Read:</u> whole article

<u>Prompt:</u> What are the central ideas of this text?

<u>Response:</u> Conformity can be good or bad, but positive conformity can spread both through specific actions and in broader ways.

Consider using the following independent reading prompts.[^1]

- What are the central ideas of this text?

- How are the central ideas developed?

- What is the main claim of this text?

- What are the points into which the main claim can be broken down?

- What evidence does the author use to support those points? Is the evidence relevant? Is it sufficient?

- What reasoning does the author use to support or explain the points? Is the reasoning sound?

- Choose one new word from your reading today, and analyze it on a vocabulary square.

|                                               |                                        |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Definition in your own words                  | Synonyms (words with the same meaning) |
| Words with the same affix or root             | Sketch                                 |
| Translation in home language (if appropriate) |                                        |

Vocabulary

**Directions:** In the classroom, you have been recording words from your texts in your vocabulary log. Throughout this unit, you have been research reading topic-related books at home to build your knowledge of social and medical epidemics and recording words in your independent reading journal.

Choose a word from your research reading or from a text you’ve read in class, and add the word to your vocabulary log. Try to choose a different word to add and to practice a different vocabulary strategy each time. For each word, be sure to add the following:

1.  The definition, or meaning, of the word

2.  The vocabulary strategy you used to figure out the meaning of the word

3.  A sketch or diagram that helps you to better understand the meaning of the word

Record new vocabulary in vocabulary logs, and mark academic vocabulary with a symbol—for example, a star:

- Academic vocabulary: Words you might find in informational texts on many different topics. For example, the words *evidence* and *rationale* are words that could be found in books on any topic.

- Domain-specific vocabulary: Words about a particular topic. For example, the words *tadpoles*, *frogspawn*, and *amphibian* are some that would be found on the topic of frogs.

Vocabulary Strategies

As a reminder, the vocabulary strategies we’ve been working on in class are:

- Context: read the sentence around the word.

- Look at the affixes for clues.

- Look at the root of the word for clues.

- Use a dictionary.

- Discuss the word with another person (after attempting some of the above strategies).

[^1]: Some of the prompts will not be appropriate for the text students are reading. Invite students to choose a prompt that works for the text they have just read.
