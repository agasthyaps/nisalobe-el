Close Reading Guide: “Kindness Contagion”

RI.7.2

(For Teacher Reference)

**Purpose and Notes**

- This close read is for students to trace the way the author develops the two central ideas of the article and the connection between them.

- Students will focus only on the selected sections of the text, which are related to the two central ideas.

- For the sake of time, first read aloud the text.

- Have students reread portions of the text as they answer text-dependent questions.

- A note-catcher along with text-dependent questions provides an opportunity for students to determine the two central ideas by first drawing out the common details that are related to each central idea.

- Continue to use discussion protocols (e.g., Think-Pair-Share, Conversation Cues, and total participation techniques) to engage all students in collaborative discussion about the text.

<li><p>Explain that now you will look closely at sections of the text in order to better understand the two central ideas of the article and how they are related. Tell students that authors sometimes develop two closely related central ideas in a text, and through analyzing the text together they will determine what these ideas are and how they are related.</p></li>

<td>Reread the first paragraph.</td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Focus students on the phrase <strong>conformity gets a bad rap</strong> in the first sentence. Remind students that if they are not sure of the meaning of unfamiliar words and phrases, they should “read around” them to look for clues in the sentence in which the words appear or the sentences before and after it. Ask: “What is the meaning of the phrase <strong>conformity gets a bad rap</strong>? What clues from the second sentence help you determine the meaning of the phrase?” (The phrase means conformity has a bad reputation. In the second sentence, the author gives negative examples of people imitating each other in a negative way such as when they “abuse drugs” and “deface national parks.” This shows why the phrase means bad reputation.) Display the Close Read: “Kindness Contagion” note-catcher, and direct students’ attention to the box labeled “Paragraph 1.” Invite students to note the examples of bad conformity they found in the appropriate space.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: What are some examples of good conformity that the author gives? (The author mentions “voting, healthy eating, and environmental conservation efforts” as examples of good conformity.) Invite students to note the examples of good conformity they found in the appropriate space on their Close Read: “Kindness Contagion” note-catchers.</p></li>
<li><p>Reread the final two sentences of the paragraph aloud for students. Invite them to discuss in their triads why the author says good conformity is “promising, but also narrow.” What are the phrases and ideas in the last sentence of the paragraph that help explain what the author means by this? (The author seems to be saying that good conformity is positive, but confined or limited in some way. The author states that other experiments looked at people who “imitate” the same “particular positive action” as others, which would be a narrow way for good conformity to spread.)</p></li>

<td>Reread the first three sentences from paragraph 2, from “In a set of new studies, my colleagues and<br />
I . . .” to “. . . taking on new forms along the way.”</td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Focus students on the first two sentences of this paragraph. Ask them to reread the sentences and Think-Pair-Share with their triads what they think the phrase <strong>broader flavor</strong> means in this context. How does the contrast with “narrow” in the last paragraph help us understand the author’s meaning? (<strong>Broader flavor</strong> means imitating the “spirit” behind actions and not just the acts themselves. Imitating the acts themselves is what the author was calling “narrow.”)</p></li>
<li><p>Direct students’ attention to the prompts for “narrow” and “broad” in the paragraph 2 box of their note-catchers, and ask them to fill in what the author means by each type of “positive conformity.” Hint: Ask students to paraphrase the second sentence of the paragraph to help them understand the difference between narrow and broad.</p></li>
<li><p>Reread the third sentence in the paragraph, beginning “This implies that kindness itself is contagious . . .”</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: What does the phrase <strong>cascade across people</strong> mean in this context? What clues can we use to discover the meaning of the phrase? (<strong>Cascade across people</strong> means spread through people. The author talks about how “kindness is contagious,” which is another way of describing how it spreads easily.)</p></li>
<li><p>Point out the phrases listed on the note-catcher (<strong>kindness is itself contagious . . . it can cascade across people . . . kindness can nonetheless trigger people to spread positivity</strong>). Invite students to work with their triads to locate them in context in the paragraph and answer the relevant question on their note-catcher: how do these phrases develop the author’s ideas about kindness?</p></li>
<li><p>Ask for a student volunteer to read aloud the final sentences of this paragraph and then for students to work in their triads to answer questions 1–4 in their note-catchers.</p></li>
<li><p>Bring the whole class together to review their answers, and ask for volunteers to identify the two main emerging ideas so far. Remind students that “emerging ideas” means they are the most important ideas we are noticing so far, but we’ll probably refine our thinking a bit by the end of the article. (The two main emerging ideas are that conformity can be both good and bad and that kindness can spread in “spirit” and not just through imitating actions.)</p></li>
<li><p>Remind students that they were going to focus on not just identifying the central ideas of the article but also on how they are related. Ask for volunteers to help combine these ideas into a sentence to show how they are related. See the Close Read: “Kindness Contagion” note-catcher (for teacher reference) for examples.</p></li>

Instruct students to fill out prompts 1–5 on the note-catcher together. Inform students that by detailing the steps of his study, the author is elaborating on his evidence. Tell students that authors use evidence to support the development of central ideas as well as support their arguments, which is something they will look at more closely in the following lessons.

<td><ul>
<li><p>Direct students’ attention to the second sentence of the paragraph, and ask them to reread it independently. Ask: “What does the phrase <strong>real question</strong> show to us about this sentence and the ideas to follow?” (It shows that it is important, because the author is saying that it is the thing they really wanted to focus on.) Tell students that although this sentence contains some difficult vocabulary, they can decode the meaning using their understanding from the text so far. Ask students, “What does the author state about how kindness spreads? Is it only through imitation?” (The author thinks kindness can spread even without “particular acts,” so it isn’t only imitation that makes kindness spread.) Ask: “What word can we replace “transcend” with for the sentence to make sense?” (We can replace “transcend” with “go past” or “go beyond.”) Invite students to write their definition of the “real question” in their own words on the appropriate spot on the note-catcher.</p></li>
<li><p>Invite students to Think-Triad-Share in their triads about the following questions: “What was the ‘pen pal’ task? What does this evidence help to show about how kindness spreads?”</p></li>
<li><p>Ask for student volunteers to share their answers, then direct students to individually complete the second question in the paragraph 4 box.</p></li>
<li><p>Direct students’ attention to the emerging central ideas they identified in the paragraph 2 box of the note-catcher. Ask students whether they feel confident identifying these ideas as central ideas in the text. Why or why not? (Yes, these are central ideas. They are the main points of the article, and the author has given evidence to develop both of them.) Invite students to discuss the final prompt on the note-catcher in their triads. After several minutes, invite volunteers to share out from each group with their ideas about how to combine the central ideas into one sentence that describes the central ideas and their relationship to each other. Point out to students how these ideas and relationship have been refined from our original idea of the emerging main ideas earlier in the lesson.</p></li>
