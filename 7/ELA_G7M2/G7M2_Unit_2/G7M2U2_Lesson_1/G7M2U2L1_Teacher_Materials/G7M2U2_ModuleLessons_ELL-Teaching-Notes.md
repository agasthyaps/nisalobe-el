English Language Learners: Grade 7: Module 2: Unit 2: Teaching Notes

Write to Inform: Are Social Epidemics Real?

Teaching Notes for Unit 2

Prioritize Lessons for Classrooms with Many English Language Learners

To prepare for the Unit 2 assessments, prioritize and expand instruction in Lesson 1, which reviews finding central ideas in a text, and Lessons 3 and 4, which first teach analyzing argument in a text. The Language Dives of Lessons 6–7, 9, and 12 support reading abilities for students at all proficiency levels, though are particularly critical for ELLs, as these approaches accelerate language development through a close look at structure and vocabulary.

Language Dives

In Lessons 6–7, students participate in the first Language Dive of the unit, which invites them to analyze the function of phrases and clauses in a sentence from the assessment text “Are Social Epidemics Real?” The Language Dives in Lessons 9 and 12 encourage students to explore how clauses and phrases function in a sentence. A Language Dive empowers students to analyze, understand, and use the language of academic sentences, which often seems opaque to students. During a Language Dive, students slow down for 10–20 minutes to have a conversation about the meaning, purpose, and structure of a compelling sentence from a complex text, or from a learning target, checklist, or rubric included in the curriculum. Following the engaging deconstruct-reconstruct-practice routine of the Language Dive, students play with the smallest “chunks” of the sentence, interpreting them, rearranging them, or using them to talk about their own lives. As a result of paying close attention to how language works, all students begin to acquire the necessary facility with academic English, and ELLs foster their overall language ability. A consistent Language Dive routine is critical in helping all students learn how to decipher complex sentences and write their own.

Most Language Dives implicitly address a wide range of Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening, and Language standards. Once teachers are comfortable with Language Dives, they may choose to supplement the focus standards in a particular Language Dive with additional standards to meet their students’ needs. Note that the Rationale section of each Language Dive also identifies supporting standards that are explicitly addressed but are not the main focus of the Language Dive.

Note that the Language Dive guides have been condensed in Module 2, as a way to reduce the amount of reading expected of teachers. Refer to the general best practices laid out in the Module 1 Language Dive guides.

Language Chunk Wall

Beginning in Module 2 and going forward, create a “Language Chunk Wall” to extend student capacity to use Language Dive structures. The Language Chunk Wall is an area in the classroom where students can display and categorize the academic phrases discussed in each Language Dive. At the end of each Language Dive, students are invited to place the Language Dive sentence chunk strips on the Language Chunk Wall into corresponding categories, such as “Nouns and noun phrases” or “Linking language.” See each Language Dive for suggested categories. Color-code each category for additional support. Examples: blue for nouns and subjects; purple for pronouns; red for predicates and verbs; yellow for adjectives; and green for adverbs, prepositions, and conjunctions. Students can then refer to the wall during subsequent speaking and writing tasks.

Mini Language Dives

Students have an opportunity to participate in Mini Language Dives beginning in Module 2, Unit 1. Mini Language Dives have the same overall purpose and follow the same general process as full Language Dives, but are condensed to 5 minutes, narrowing students’ attention on deconstructing the focus structure, reconstructing the sentence, and practicing the focus structure. Mini Language Dives give ELLs additional support in building language and literacy skills, as well as habits of mind. Mini Language Dives are most often optional and can be found in the corresponding lessons within this guide. When required for all students, Mini Language Dives are built into the body of the lesson in the Teacher Guide. In this Unit, optional Mini Language Dives appear in Lessons 3 and 10.

Diversity and Inclusion

Investigate the routines, practices, rituals, beliefs, norms, and experiences that are important to ELLs and their families. Integrate this background into the classroom as students engage with texts. Consider the values and narratives embedded in class texts, and try to anticipate their relevance to ELLs. Note that the articles read in this unit contain references to sensitive topics such as homeless and insensitivity as well as behaviors that demonstrate the downside of conformity. These issues must be carefully and sensitively discussed to give students context as they read the story. Consult with a guidance counselor, school social worker, or ESL teacher for further investigation of diversity and inclusion.

Conversation Cues

Encourage productive and equitable conversation with Conversation Cues, which are questions to ask students that help achieve four goals:

- (Goal 1) encourage all students to talk and be understood;

- (Goal 2) listen carefully to one another and seek to understand;

- (Goal 3) deepen thinking; and

- (Goal 4) think with others to expand the conversation (adapted from Michaels, Sarah, and Cathy O’Connor. *Talk Science Primer*.

Anderson. \[2009\]. *Classroom Discussions: Using Math Talk to Help Students Learn, Grades K–6*. Second Edition. Math Solutions Publications).

Refer to the Tools Page (http://eled.org/tools) for the complete set of cues. For ELLs, Conversation Cues are especially critical because they improve language processing abilities and increase engagement and participation.

Strategic Grouping

Students work in pairs and small groups to analyze texts, engage in text-based discussions, and plan and write a peer essay. While reading the articles in class, students can read independently, in pairs or small groups, or as a full class. In earlier lessons, match ELLs with a partner who has greater language proficiency. The conversations, reading, and writing support that occur as a result of such strategic pairing will greatly serve the language development of both partners. In later lessons, cultivate ELLs’ autonomy and flexibility by encouraging them to vary their reading habits.

Text-Based Discussions

In Lesson 2, students review the discussion norms they developed in Module 1, adding expectations, cues, and sentence starters for Level 3 Conversation Cues to ask students to explain their thinking. Students then participate in a text-based discussion to collaboratively analyze and evaluate the arguments in two nonfiction articles. In Lessons 3 and 5, students continue practicing text-based discussions in preparation for a cumulative discussion in Lessons 6–7. These informal discussions provide ELLs with the opportunity to practice vocabulary and language structures that they will use during the formal, assessed text-based discussion in Lessons 6–7.

Differentiated Materials

Differentiated materials are available for ELLs and other students who would benefit from an increased level of support. These resources have been modified for the purposes of creating accessibility to content and concepts and supporting language development. Depending upon the task being carried out with a material, images, selected response options, answer banks, sentence frames, or model responses have been embedded to guide students’ thinking without compromising a focus on standards and the skills that students are developing and applying to meet them.

Celebration

Celebrate the courage, enthusiasm, diversity, and bilingual assets that ELLs bring to the classroom. Additionally, students can celebrate their successful attempts at communication and their ability to extend and enhance the discussions.
