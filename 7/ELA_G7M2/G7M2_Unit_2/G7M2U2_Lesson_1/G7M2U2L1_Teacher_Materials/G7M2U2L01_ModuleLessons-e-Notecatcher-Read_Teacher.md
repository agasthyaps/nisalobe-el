<p>The author uses these phrases to describe kindness:</p>
<p>“kindness is itself contagious . . . it can cascade across people . . . kindness can nonetheless trigger people to spread positivity.”</p>
<p>How do these phrases develop the author’s ideas about kindness?</p>
<p>They help convey how kindness can spread among people quickly and forcefully.</p></td>

<p>Conformity can be bad, but it can also result in kindness spreading in action and in spirit.</p></td>

<td><p>How do the evidence and details the author provides develop the central ideas in the article?</p>
<p>The author gives examples of different times when people imitate one another to develop the idea that conformity can be good or bad. The author discusses studies he and his colleagues did to show how kindness spreads in both narrow and broad ways. For example, the pen pal task shows that people can change their behavior just by hearing about people doing a completely different task. Also, people donated more money after hearing that others acted generously. This shows how positive conformity can spread in narrow and broad ways.</p></td>
