5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

W.7.2b, L.7.1a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

For example, one animal researcher named Daniel Pearce thought **that birds in large flocks  
might be responding to patterns of light and dark shapes when deciding how to move**.  
(from paragraph 3 of Model Informative Essay: “Computer Programs and Animal Behavior”  
by EL Education)

**Lesson 10 Placement**

Lead this Mini after students analyze the proof paragraphs in Work Time A.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target (I can write Proof Paragraph 1 of my pair informative essay using evidence from the text to support my ideas.) and W.7.2b by showing how a sentence within a Proof Paragraph develops the topic of a model essay with an example. The sentence also helps students to address L.7.1a by providing an opportunity for students to consider the function of a sentence with a **that** clause. Supporting standard: W.7.2c

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses a **that** clause with the purpose of explaining a researcher’s thoughts.

- Transfer: **that** + subject + verb phrase when writing an informative essay on the End of Unit 2 Assessment

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **For example, one animal researcher named Daniel Pearce thought <u>that birds in large flocks might be responding to patterns of light and dark shapes when deciding how to move</u>.**

- Ask:

“What is this sentence about?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **that birds in large flocks might be responding to patterns of light and dark shapes when deciding how to move**

- Ask:

“What does this chunk tell us?” (It tells us what an animal researcher, Daniel Pearce, thought about how birds move.)

“What do you already know about clauses that start with that?” (We can use that to connect a clause with the information that comes before it in a sentence.)

- Ask:

“Can you figure out if this clause is a subject, verb, or object in the sentence?” (It’s the direct object of the verb, thought.)

- Remind students that clauses that begin with **that** are dependent clauses that can function as nouns or adjectives in a sentence.

- Ask:

“So, what is the function of this that clause in this sentence? How do you know?” (It’s functioning as a noun. We know this because it is the direct object of thought, and direct objects are nouns.)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **For example, one animal researcher named Daniel Pearce thought <u>that birds in large flocks might be responding to patterns of light and dark shapes when deciding how to move</u>.**

- Ask:

“Can you figure out why the writer started this sentence with the linking phrase ‘For example’?” (because this sentence provides an example of one animal researcher’s thinking)

“How does this example support the point the writer is making in this Proof Paragraph?” (This sentence develops the topic by providing an example of one researcher’s findings as a result of using computer programs to see if animals move by responding to different levels of light.)

- As needed, encourage students to refer back to the model essay to remind themselves of the point presented in the second Proof Paragraph.

- Ask:

“What examples will you use to support the points in the Proof Paragraphs of your informative essay?” (Responses will vary.)

- Cue students by saying:

“I’ll give you 30 seconds to discuss this with a partner.”

- Ask:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target: ‘I can write Proof Paragraph 1 of my pair informative essay using evidence from the text to support my ideas’?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

**For example, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ think(s) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

name of source **that** clause

- Say:

“Use this frame to write a sentence for a Proof Paragraph in your informative essay.”

- Responses will vary, but may include:

**For example, <u>crime detectives</u> think(s) <u>that mapping can help them notice patterns</u>.**

name of source **that** clause

**(that** + subject + verb phrase = **that** clause**)**
