Organize the Model: Proof Paragraph Strips

W.7.2b

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:**

1.  Cut apart the evidence strips.

2.  Read and organize the strips. Put the strips of evidence that support Point 1: “Researchers have started using computer programs to understand how animals move.” on the yellow construction paper. Put the strips of evidence that support Point 2: “They use what they know about how computer models work to understand both the movement and choices of animals.” on the blue construction paper.

3.  Check your work against the displayed Model Informative Essay.
