RI.7.1, RI.7.8

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** In the boxes below, record the main claim the author makes in the article, the points into which that claim is broken down, and the evidence and reasoning the author uses to support those points. If a point has multiple pieces of supporting evidence and reasoning, record them all in the boxes below the point. Then evaluate whether the evidence is relevant and sufficient and the reasoning is sound, and underline YES or NO in the right-hand column.

<td colspan="2"><strong>The evidence the author presents supports the point that kindness can take on new forms as it spreads. The fact that people wrote friendlier letters or donated money based on hearing about others’ actions or feelings shows that people can “catch” kindness without having to imitate the exact action. As the author says, the evidence “suggests that kindness evolves as it diffuses, ‘infecting’ behaviors through which new individuals can express it.”</strong></td>

**Directions:** Write to answer the following prompts:

Evaluate whether the argument is strong. Are the points supported by relevant and sufficient evidence and sound reasoning? Are the author’s sources credible?

**Directions:** Underline **is** or **is not** in the first sentence, and then complete each sentence starter.

The argument in this article is/is not strong.

The argument in this article is strong. The writer’s main claim is **that kindness is contagious and can take on new forms as it spreads.** He supports this claim with **evidence from his studies.** For example, **the author shows how people don’t even need to see that person doing something kind to change their behaviors.** The author uses reasoning to **explain that kindness might be contagious because people “value being on the same page with others.”** Therefore, the author’s argument is strong because **he uses sufficient and relevant evidence and sound reasoning.**

**Directions:** Record any questions you have to discuss in the text-based discussion.

Answers will vary, but may include:

What exactly made the people in the study donate more money?

How was the pen-pal task related to the charity task?

Why do people feel rewarded when learning they have the same opinion as others?

| **Essay Planning:** How does this article add to your understanding of how social scientists use ideas from the study of epidemics to understand and explain human behavior?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| The title of the article says that kindness can spread **“like a virus.”** The writer then uses words to describe kindness such as **“contagious” and that it “infects” people.** He also explains about the experiments he and his colleagues did to examine **how kindness can spread.** The scientists used these experiments to see **exactly how it is contagious.** This method of study is very similar to **how people would study disease epidemics.** |
