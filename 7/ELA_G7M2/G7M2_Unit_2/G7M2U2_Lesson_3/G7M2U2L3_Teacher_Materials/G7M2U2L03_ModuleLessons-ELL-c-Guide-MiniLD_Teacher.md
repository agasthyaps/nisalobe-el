5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

RI.7.8, L.7.2a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

People who had watched others donate generously **wrote friendlier, more empathic, and more supportive notes** than those who had watched others behave greedily. (from paragraph 5 of “Kindness Contagion” by Jamil Zaki)

**Lesson 3 Placement**

Lead this Mini after students evaluate argument in “Kindness Contagion” in Work Time A.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target **(I can evaluate whether evidence is relevant and sufficient to support the argument.)** and RI.7.8 by drawing their attention to relevant evidence provided in support of the main argument in the text. The sentence also helps students to address L.7.2a because it contains an example of how commas are used to separate coordinate adjectives.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses commas with the purpose of separating a series of coordinate adjectives.

- Transfer: **more** + adjective/adjective + -**er**/-**ier** used when writing an informative essay on the End of Unit 2 Assessment

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **People who had watched others donate generously <u>wrote friendlier, more empathic, and more supportive notes</u> than those who had watched others behave greedily.**

- Ask:

“What is this sentence about?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **wrote friendlier, more empathic, and more supportive notes**

- Ask:

“Who wrote friendlier, more empathetic and more supportive notes?” (people who had watched others donate generously)

“Can you figure out which words in this chunk are adjectives?” (friendlier, \[more\] empathic, and \[more\] supportive)

“What are these adjectives describing?” (notes; specifically, the notes written by people who had watched others donate generously)

“Why does the writer use commas between each adjective?” (Because these adjectives all describe the same thing: notes. When we use a series of coordinate adjectives to describe a single noun, we separate them using commas. The pauses the commas provide between adjectives help the reader comprehend the description.)

“How can we use commas to separate coordinate adjectives in our speaking or writing?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **People who had watched others donate generously <u>wrote friendlier, more empathic, and more supportive notes</u> than those who had watched others behave greedily.**

- Ask:

“Why does the author use the word friendlier instead of friendly? Why does he use more in front of empathic and supportive?” (Because he is using these adjectives to compare the notes written by two different groups of people: those who had watched others donate generously with the notes written by people who had watched others behave greedily.)

“Does this evidence provide relevant and sufficient support for the author’s main claim that kindness is contagious and takes on new forms as it spreads? How so?” (Yes. This evidence is a clear example of how seeing someone practice kindness can inspire others to be kind.)

“What additional evidence could the author include to support his claim?” (Responses will vary.)

- Ask:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target:  
‘I can evaluate whether evidence is relevant and sufficient to support the argument’?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

**The books I read at home are \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

**than the books I read at school.**

(**more** + adjective = comparative adjective)

(adjective + -**er**/-**ier** = comparative adjective)

- Say:

“Use this frame to talk in your own words and with your partners about the differences between the books you read at home and at school using comparative adjectives.”

- Responses will vary, but may include:

**The books I read at home are <u>longer</u>, <u>more interesting</u>, and <u>funnier</u> than the books I read at school.**

(**more** + adjective = comparative adjective)

(adjective + -**er**/-**ier** = comparative adjective)
