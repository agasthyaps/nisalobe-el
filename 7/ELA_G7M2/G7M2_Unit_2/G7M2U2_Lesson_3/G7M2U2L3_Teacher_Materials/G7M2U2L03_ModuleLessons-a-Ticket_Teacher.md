RI.7.2

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, respond to the following prompt.

In reading and analyzing “Kindness Contagion” for central ideas and argument, what did you notice about the relationship between the central ideas and main claim? What would be the advantage of talking about ideas sometimes as central ideas and sometimes as a main claim?

The central ideas and the main claim in the article “Kindness Contagion” were sometimes the same, but not always. The advantage of talking about ideas in different ways is that we can either look at them as central ideas the author develops or as main claims the author is trying to argue for. If we look at them as main claims, then we can more closely examine the evidence and reasoning to see if we agree with the argument the author is making.
