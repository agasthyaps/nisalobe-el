**Write a Pair Informative Essay**

**Directions:** Throughout this unit, you will work with a partner to plan and write an essay to answer the question: **how do epidemiologists use ideas from the study of crime detection to understand and explain epidemics?**

Most people have heard stories of detectives solving a crime. They might also know that doctors work hard to find the source of a disease. But would they think that these two jobs have anything to do with each other? In fact, both epidemiologists and detectives use mapping to help them. They also rely on the “shoe-leather” method to gather information. It is fair to say that the study of epidemics has been informed by ideas from crime solving.

The first idea from crime solving that has informed the study of epidemics is mapping. Crime detectives use maps keep track of where crimes are happening. This helps them see if there are any patterns. Also, they see whether they should increase the number of police officers in a certain area. Epidemiologists also look for patterns in their maps. In *Patient Zero*, Peters writes about Dr. John Snow. He suspected that the 1854 cholera outbreak in Soho was due to contaminated drinking water. He decided to map where the sick people lived to help him understand the outbreak. Snow “drew a black bar for every case” of cholera he found (49). He also added in the water pump locations. Making this map helped him see that all the cases could be traced back to one water pump on Broad Street (49). Mapping out where epidemics are happening can help epidemiologists determine the cause of epidemics.

The shoe-leather method has also helped both detectives and epidemiologists solve their mysteries. Detectives use the shoe-leather method when they go door to door to collect information from witnesses or people who may know something about a crime. Epidemiologists also gather information in a similar way. For example, John Snow wanted to determine the source of the Soho cholera epidemic. He also wanted to figure out how it spread. He used the shoe-leather method to collect more information about the epidemic. First, he “marched up and down the streets of Soho, taking samples from all the local pumps” to test for cholera (45). He also asked residents whether someone in their home had been infected by cholera. George Soper, who investigated the outbreak of typhoid, did a lot of the same things. He “visited each of the families Mary Mallon had cooked for” (82). This helped him identify Mary as the source. Peters even compares George Soper to the famous fictional detective Sherlock Holmes (81). Gathering information from witnesses, just like a crime detective, has helped epidemiologists learn more about the spread of contagious diseases.

Understanding the cause and spread of diseases has always been fascinating for people. Interestingly, the same techniques used to solve crimes has made it possible to get answers about epidemics. Mapping helps to show larger patterns. The shoe-leather method fills in the gaps. Both techniques have seen upgrades in modern times. In *Patient Zero*, Peters writes about how computer maps “provide doctors and scientists with a real-time map of the outbreak of epidemic disease” (50). Likewise, both crime detectives and epidemiologists can use social media to gather more information. Many factors can contribute to the cause and spread of a disease. Yet the insights from solving crimes can help epidemiologists get to the bottom of them. It seems clear that these techniques will continue to be useful to both detectives and epidemiologists.
