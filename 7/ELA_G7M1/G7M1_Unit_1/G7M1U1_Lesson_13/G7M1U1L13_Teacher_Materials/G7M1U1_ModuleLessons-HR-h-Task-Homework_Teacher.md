Homework: Text-Dependent Questions:  
*A Long Walk to Water*, Chapter 10

(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Answer the following questions to help you discuss theme in chapter 10 of *A Long Walk to Water*.

1.  Reread these sentences:

“Salva reached for his gourd. He knew it to be half full, but suddenly it felt much lighter, as if there was hardly any water left in it” (58).

What does this description say about the water in the gourd?

2.  Salva is just realizing he is carrying the wrong water gourd.

3.  Carrying the water for so long is making some of it evaporate.

4.  Salva is mistaken about how much water was left in the gourd.

5.  <u>The idea of having to give away water makes it seem like there’s less of it.</u>

6.  Reread this sentence:

“Like a miracle, the small amounts of water revived them. They were able to stagger to their feet and join the group as the walking continued” (58).

Based on context, what is the meaning of **revived** as it is used in this sentence?

7.  caused to be tired

8.  made more visible

9.  <u>brought back to life</u>

10. affected in a strong way

11. Reread the text from page 59:

“If he were older and stronger, would he have given water to those men? Or would he, like most of the group, have kept his water for himself?”

What do these questions show about Salva in this part of the story? How does this develop the theme?

These questions show that Salva is thinking about what he would have done if his situation were different. He is wondering what kind of person he is and if he would have been brave and selfless and shared with the men or been like the others who haven’t. This develops the theme that surviving in harsh conditions means making difficult decisions.

12. Look more closely at the ways Salva’s thinking and state of mind are described in the text with these examples:

“He felt sick at the thought of those men” (59).

“. . . a worry that had been growing like a long shadow across his thoughts . . .” (59)

“Salva shook his head, unable to imagine what life would be like in the camp without Uncle” (60).

“I mustn’t act like a baby—I must try to be strong” (60).

How do these descriptions of Salva’s thinking develop a theme in the text? Use evidence from these quotes or other quotes in the book in your response.

These descriptions show that surviving in difficult conditions is just as difficult mentally as it is physically. The author describes how Salva is “sick at the thought” of the men dying of thirst and that his worry “had been growing like a long shadow across his thoughts” (59). It is clear that trying to survive in these conditions is affecting Salva’s mind negatively. But he also knows he has to remain strong in order to survive, and he reminds himself of this when he tells himself that “he mustn’t act like a baby” (60). This helps him to keep going even in these difficult circumstances.

13. Reread this sentence:

“‘Maybe they will leave us alone now that they have robbed us,’ Salva thought” (63).

How does this sentence affect the ending of the chapter?

It makes the ending sadder and more surprising, because it shows that Salva thinks the men will leave, but in fact they kill his uncle.

14. Write a brief, objective summary of chapter 10, following the criteria you established in earlier lessons.

The chapter opens with the men who are visiting Nya’s village walking by her house and looking at the trees. One of the men says that they will find water in between the trees, but Nya doesn’t know what they are talking about because she is sure there is no water there.

Salva’s story continues with him thinking about giving water to the thirsty men, but his uncle stops him. Salva expresses his worry that his family will never find him, and his uncle tells him that they probably did not survive.

Salva is trying his best to stay strong as they make it through the desert.

Just as they are reaching the end of the desert, they run into a group of men with guns, from the Nuer tribe. The men take the belongings from others but leave Salva alone. Just as he is hoping they are going to leave, they tie up his uncle and shoot him. This chapter further develops the theme that people must be strong to survive nature and war.
