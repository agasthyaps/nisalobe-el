Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Instruction of focus assessment standards occurs in the following:

<!-- -->

- RL.7.1 – In Work Time A of this lesson, students use evidence from literary texts to infer the topic of the module.

- RI.7.1 – In Work Time A of this lesson, students use evidence from informational texts to infer the topic of the module.

<!-- -->

- In Work Time B, students encounter the performance task and the guiding questions for the module, as well as the module’s anchor text. The Performance Task anchor chart (for teacher reference) and all performance task materials are included in the Performance Task Overview and Resources.

- In Work Time C, students explore the anchor text *A Long Walk to Water*, noticing and wondering about text and graphic features.

- In Closing and Assessment A, students use the Think-Pair-Share protocol to engage in a collaborative discussion about their academic mindsets.

- In this lesson, students do not collect new vocabulary independently. Instead, the class collects new vocabulary on the academic word wall. Students are introduced to their vocabulary logs in the future, where they will collect vocabulary from the texts they read.

- In this lesson, students engage in a protocol. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. Students engage in the following new protocol in this lesson (instructions for which appear at the first point of use in the lesson and in the Classroom Protocols document online):

<!-- -->

- **Think-Pair-Share** promotes productive and equitable conversations, where all students are given the time and space to think, share, and consider the ideas of others. It ensures that all students simultaneously engage with the same text or topic, while promoting synthesis and the social construction of knowledge.

<!-- -->

- In this lesson, students also engage in several total participation techniques. Total participation techniques are used to solicit answers to questions or prompts from a wide variety of students. Rather than just calling on those students who may have their hands raised, these total participation techniques challenge and hold accountable all students. In this lesson, students engage in the following new total participation techniques (instructions for which appear at the first point of use in the lesson):

<!-- -->

- **Turn and Talk** is one of the easiest, quickest, and most efficient means of creating collaboration among students. It can be used practically at any time, anywhere, in a lesson in any content area.

- **Cold Call** serves as an engaging and challenging yet supportive way to hold students accountable for answering oral questions, regardless of whether a hand is raised. Cold Call requires students to think and interact with the question at hand, even if they’re not sure of the answer. Cold Call also promotes equity in the classroom; students who normally dominate the discourse step back and allow other students to demonstrate their knowledge and expertise.

- **Thumb-O-Meter** helps visualize student comfort level or readiness in relation to a learning target or aspect of their work using their thumb. Adjust the instruction accordingly.

- **Red Light, Green Light** helps visualize student comfort level or readiness in relation to a learning target or aspect of their work, using objects, colors, locations, or shared metaphors. Adjust the instruction accordingly.

- **Equity Sticks** ensure academic equity by physically tracking who has been called upon or interacted with during the course of the class. This is especially useful during whole-class discussions or while working with large groups of students.

<!-- -->

- This lesson is the first that includes built-out instruction for the use of Goal 1 Conversation Cues. Conversation Cues are questions that promote productive and equitable conversation (adapted from Michaels, Sarah and Cathy O’Connor. *Talk Science Primer*. TERC, 2012. http://inquiryproject.terc.edu/shared/pd/TalkScience_Primer.pdf. Based on Chapin, Suzanne, et al. *Classroom Discussions: Using Math Talk to Help Students Learn, Grades K–6*. 2nd ed., Math Solutions Publications, 2009). Goal 1 Conversation Cues encourage all students to talk and be understood. As the modules progress, Goals 2, 3, and 4 Conversation Cues are gradually introduced. To review the complete set of cues, refer to Overview–Conversation Cues on the Tools Page (http://eled.org/tools). Provide students with a thinking journal or scrap paper. Examples of the Goal 1 Conversation Cues are (with expected responses):

<!-- -->

- After any question that requires thoughtful consideration and allows time for students to think and process language internally:

“I’ll give you time to think and write or sketch.”

“I’ll give you time to discuss this with a partner.”

- To help students share, expand, and clarify thoughts:

“Can you say more about that?”

“Sure. I think that \_\_\_\_\_.”

“Can you give an example?”

“OK. One example is \_\_\_\_\_.”

“So, do you mean \_\_\_\_\_?”

“You’ve got it./No, sorry, that’s not what I mean. I mean \_\_\_\_\_.”

- Conversation Cues are similar to discussion norms, which are introduced in a future lesson, in that they seek to foster productive and collaborative conversation. Furthermore, Conversation Cues aim to ensure equitable conversation by gradually building student capacity to become productive, collaborative participants. Goal 1 Conversation Cues focus on the fundamentals of encouraging students to talk and be understood. Goals 2–4 take students to deeper levels of conversation, from listening to others, to deepening their thinking, to thinking with others. (SL.7.1a, SL.7.1b) ▲

- Students are introduced to academic mindsets in Closing and Assessment A of this lesson. Academic mindsets refer to the motivational components that influence a student’s desire and will to engage in learning. Research shows that academic mindsets are a better predictor of student success than any other determining factor. Students will develop an understanding of all four as the module progresses. The Academic Mindsets are listed below:

- I belong in this academic community.

- I can succeed at this.

- My ability and competence grow with my effort.

- This work has value for me.

- At the end of the lesson, distribute the Homework Resources and review the format of the document and this lesson’s specific assignment with students.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- During Work Time A, observe student interaction and allow them to grapple. Provide supportive frames and demonstrations only after students have grappled with the task. Observe the areas in which they need additional support.

- After Work Time B, invite students to reflect on additional examples of stories about refugees.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- If students have worked on EL Education modules in previous grades, this module will build on those foundations.

Support All Students

- Students may need additional support reading the text excerpts in the Infer the Topic protocol during Work Time A. Invite students to help each other by reading the excerpts aloud to each other.

- Note there is a differentiated version of Infer the Topic: I Notice/I Wonder note-catcher used in Work Time A. ▲

- In this lesson, pair ELLs with a native speaker to support their comprehension. In addition, consider strategic grouping for ELLs at this point in the year, and continue to vary grouping according to the task over the year. Pair ELLs with a partner who has more advanced or native language proficiency. The partner with greater language proficiency can serve as a model in the pair, initiating discussions and providing implicit sentence frames, for example. ▲

- *A Long Walk to Water* includes depictions of war, poverty, death, and the experiences of refugees. These issues may be sensitive for students, and some students may connect with these topics personally or deeply. After reading these sections of the text for the gist, students have time to reflect. Monitor students and determine if there are issues surfacing that need to be discussed in more detail as a whole group, in smaller groups, or independently. Reflections may be personal, and students are not required to share them.

- Where possible, invite students to share their own experiences or understandings of Africa, and ensure they recognize that Africa is a huge continent containing many countries. Ensure they recognize that Sudan is just one country in this continent and that this topic is focused on one specific event in the country’s history.

- To support ELLs, this lesson explicitly outlines discussion protocols; allows time for students to investigate academic vocabulary, build background knowledge, and make inferences about the topic of the module; and allows space for diverse perspectives.

- ELLs may find the **Infer the Topic Resources** challenging because of the volume of potentially unfamiliar new language. Encourage students to focus on select resources and language that is familiar or most approachable. Invite them to congratulate themselves for what they do understand.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.B.6 and 7.I.C.10.

Assessment Guidance

- Monitor students’ I Notice/I Wonder note-catchers in Work Time A to ensure they are on the right track for inferring what the module is about at the end of the Infer the Topic protocol.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will spend some time discussing their reflections on the module guiding questions. Students will read and discuss the first chapter of *A Long Walk to Water* and also begin considering what it means to be “ethical” in the context of the classroom and in relation to the materials they are reading. Their engagement with the text and classroom discussions in this lesson will help prepare them for deeper analysis of the novel in the following lessons.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- During all interaction, be aware that partnering with, looking at, talking with, or touching a different gender may be uncomfortable and inappropriate for some students. In addition, some students may believe it is inappropriate to speak with other students of another gender at all during class. In advance, speak with students to determine their needs, and if necessary, seek alternative arrangements for students according to their cultural traditions.

- Prepare the following:

- Academic word wall with blank word cards and markers located close by. This is an area of the classroom in which academic words will be added throughout the year.

- Domain-specific word wall with blank cards and markers located close by. This is an area of the classroom in which domain-specific vocabulary will be added throughout the year.

- Infer the Topic resources. Post them around the room.

- Performance Task anchor chart and the Guiding Questions anchor chart.

- Equity sticks by writing each student’s name on a wooden craft stick. Place them in a container for use during Closing and Assessment A.

- Optional materials (sticky notes, whiteboards, and dry-erase markers) for Closing and Assessment A.

- A large world map showing the countries of the world and pins for the class to begin adding the countries of the people they encounter in the texts they read. Place a pin in your location.

- Small label with the book title and author (*A Long Walk to Water* by Linda Sue Park) to attach to a pin and place on the world map. This needs to be large enough to see, but not too large to cover up too much of the map.

- Ensure there is a copy of Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 1 at each student’s workspace.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Opening A: Post videos on personal devices such as tablets or computers if possible.

- Opening A: Complete the modeling for the Infer the Topic: I Notice/I Wonder note-catcher with the class in a word-processing document such as a Google Doc.

- Work Time A: Students complete their I Notice/I Wonder note-catchers in a word-processing document such as a Google Doc.

- Work Time A: Students complete their note-catchers in a word-processing document using speech-to-text facilities activated on devices or using an app or software such as http://eled.org/0103.

- Closing and Assessment A: Students complete their I Notice/I Wonder note-catchers in a word-processing document such as a Google Doc.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.7.1 (5 minutes)

- As students enter the classroom, have them complete **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 1**.

- Direct students’ attention to the posted learning target, and select a volunteer to read it aloud:

“I can use evidence to infer the topic of this module from the resources.”

- Guide students through an intentional Think-Pair-Share:

- Move students into pairs, and invite them to label themselves A and B.

- Pose the question, and give students time to think independently and silently about their answer to the question.

- Invite partner A to ask partner B the question.

- Give partner B a specified time frame (e.g., 30 seconds, 1 minute) to share his or her response.

- Have partners reverse roles and repeat steps 3–4.

- Using a total participation technique (e.g., cold call, equity sticks), invite students to share their responses with the whole group.

- Repeat this process with remaining questions.

“Why do we have learning targets? What is the purpose of learning targets?” (To give us a goal. The goal is to be able to say “I can . . . ,” which means that the target has been achieved.)

- Underline the word *infer* in the learning target.

- Ensure that students have access to an **online or print translation dictionary**.

- Invite students to Turn and Talk with their partner:

- When prompted, students turn to a partner.

- In a set amount of time, students share their ideas about the question.

- Students may be instructed to share some key ideas from their paired discussions with the whole class.

“What does *infer* mean? If you are going to infer the topic, what does that mean?” (When we make an inference, we make a good guess based on the evidence we have seen. Inferring the topic means making a good guess about the topic based on the content of the resources we will look at.)

- Cold call students using **equity sticks** to share their responses:

- Name the question before identifying students to answer it.

- Call on students regardless of whether they have their hands raised.

- Scaffold questions from simple to increasingly complex, probing for deeper explanations.

- Connect thinking threads by returning to previous comments and connecting them to current ones; model this for students and teach them to do it, too.

- With student support, record the meaning of *infer* on the **academic word wall** with translations in students’ home languages (make a good guess about the topic based on the content of the resources). Consider writing synonyms or sketching a visual above each key term to scaffold students’ understanding.

For Lighter Support

- Invite a student to paraphrase the key points of the learning targets in language that makes sense to them.

For Heavier Support

- When introducing the word *infer*, provide some visuals and ask students to make an inference about them—for example, a broken window with a baseball next to it (someone threw a baseball and it shattered the glass) or a dog that is covered in mud (the dog played in the mud and got dirty).

Work Time

A. Infer the Topic – RI.7.1 (15 minutes)

- Revisit the learning target, relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can use evidence to infer the topic of this module from the resources.”

- Focus students on the **Infer the Topic resources** posted around the room.

- Display and distribute the **Infer the Topic: I Notice/I Wonder note-catcher**, and the **Infer the Topic: I Notice/I Wonder note-catcher** ▲ for students who need extra support. The differentiated note-catcher supports students’ analysis with prompts and sentence starters. ▲ Review the note-catcher with all students to ensure they understand how and why they are completing it.

- Ask:

“What are you going to record in this column? How does that information connect to the information in the next column?” (Possible response: I will record things I notice or see in the first column. I will record things I’m thinking or wondering about and questions I have in the second column. The second column might be questions or wonderings about the things I see. So I will align the questions and wonderings with the the noticings.)

- Focus students on the question at the top, and read it aloud:

“What do you think you will be learning about in this module?”

- Tell students that the purpose of the note-catcher is to take notes to help them remember their thinking. It isn’t something they will hand in for assessment, so they can record in pictures or words. They do not need to write in full sentences.

- Be transparent about why students are noticing and wondering (because it is a helpful way to understand and explore a new topic or text).

- Display, read aloud, and ensure students understand the **Directions for Infer the Topic**. (Refer to the Classroom Protocols document located on the Tools Page http://eled.org/tools for the full version of the protocol.)

- Guide students through the protocol. Allow them to choose what resources to observe, so those who may not be able to read independently have the option to view an image. Mixed-proficiency pairs can choose the resources they want to observe and begin by discussing what the text means. Encourage students to agree or disagree with one another about what the text means using sentence frames. Examples: “I agree because \_\_\_\_\_.” “I disagree because \_\_\_\_\_.” ▲

- Refocus whole group. Think-Pair-Share:

“Now that you have looked at some resources, what do you think this module might be about?” (Responses will vary, but could include: water, war, long journeys, facing adversity.)

“What evidence supports your inference?” (Responses will vary.)

“Can you say more about that? I’ll give you some time to think and write or sketch.” (The resources seem to be about people facing difficult circumstances and searching for peace. Many of the pieces seem to focus on a group of young men from Sudan who were forced to escape from a war.)

- Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the learning target, using a checking for understanding technique—for example, using Thumb-O-Meter or Red Light, Green Light.

<!-- -->

- Thumb-O-Meter:

<!-- -->

- Tell students they are going to use the Thumb-O-Meter strategy to reflect on their comfort level or readiness on the learning target.

- When prompted to reflect on the learning target, students show their comfort level with it by holding their thumb up, down, or sideways. By holding their thumb sideways, they are indicating they will need some support. By holding their thumb down, they are indicating they feel uncomfortable with the learning target.

- Use students’ self-assessment to adjust instruction, and check in with students showing a thumb-down or thumb-sideways.

<!-- -->

- Red Light, Green Light:

<!-- -->

- Provide students with **red, yellow, and green objects** (popsicle sticks, poker chips, cards, etc.).

- When prompted to reflect on the learning target, students place the color on their desk that reflects their comfort level or readiness (red: stuck or not ready; yellow: need support soon; green: ready to move on).

- Target support for the reds first, then move on to the yellows and greens.

- Students change their colors as needed to describe their status.

- Scan student responses, and make a note of students who might need support. Check in with them moving forward.

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time A, fill out a row or two of the I Notice/I Wonder note-catcher as a whole class so that students have a very concrete model of how to do this work independently.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time A, distribute a partially completed copy of the **I Notice/I Wonder note-catcher**. This will provide students with models for the kind of information they should enter while relieving the volume of writing required.

Work Time

B. Introduce the Performance Task and Module Guiding Questions (10 minutes)

- Tell students that they will now look at a few additional artifacts as they continue to hone their understanding of the module topic.

- Direct students’ attention to the **Performance Task anchor chart**, and read the task aloud.

- As students may be overwhelmed by the Performance Task anchor chart, assure them that they will continue to explore the meaning of the chart in subsequent lessons and units.

- Turn and Talk:

“What do you notice?” (We will be creating an illustrated ebook. We will be explaining the stories of the Lost Children as well as telling a story.)

“What do you wonder?” (Responses will vary, but may include: How will our ebooks be different from regular books? Where will we get the information to better understand the Lost Children’s stories?)

“Now that you have analyzed the performance task, has your inference of what this module might be about changed? How?” (Responses will vary.)

- Clarify anything pertinent to this specific performance task. Consider displaying a model performance task from a former student. Ask students to make connections between the model and the performance task.

- Display the **Module Guiding Questions anchor chart**, and read the questions aloud.

- Turn and Talk:

“Why do we have guiding questions for each module?” (Responses will vary, but may include the following: to help focus our learning and to help us think about the performance task.)

- Underline the phrase *habits of character*. Ask students to help break down the phrase by defining *habits* and *character*. Turn and Talk:

“What do these words mean? What strategies can you use to find out?” (*Habits* are actions we do regularly, or routines; *character* means strong moral and ethical qualities; I used the context of the chart and a dictionary as strategies to define these words.)

- Invite students to work in their triads to determine the meanings of the words *habits* and *character*, and use a total participation technique to select a student to share with the whole group.

- Ask for a volunteer to combine the meanings of the words to find what the phrase means. (*Habits of character* are the traits that help us succeed in life and school, like working hard, treating one another well, and helping others.)

- Add these to the **domain-specific word wall**.

- Repeat this process to determine the meaning of the word *haven* (a place of safety or refuge).

- Add the new word to the academic word wall, including translations in home languages.

- Tell students that these are the questions that will guide their thinking and learning throughout the module. Turn and Talk:

“What do you notice?” (Responses will vary, but may include: that we are focusing on the history of the Lost Children as well as their habits of character.)

“What do you wonder?” (Responses will vary, but may include: What were the causes of the Sudanese civil war? What happened to the Lost Children when they came to the United States? Which “lost children” will we be writing about?)

“Now that you have analyzed the guiding questions and performance task, has your inference of what this module might be about changed?” (Responses will vary.)

“What evidence did you find to support your inference?” (Responses will vary.)

Conversation Cue: “How is what \_\_\_\_\_ said the same as/different from what \_\_\_\_\_ said? I’ll give you time to think and write.” (Responses will vary.)

- Clarify that this module will be about the story of the Lost Children of Sudan, who were forced from their home by war.

- Turn and Talk:

“What does this topic mean to you at this point? Why might it be meaningful to study this topic?” (Responses will vary, but may include: The story of the Lost Children might be able to help us understand the experiences of people facing war around the world. The story of the Lost Children will have a lot to teach us about what it takes to survive in difficult circumstances and how to be good people.)

“From what you know so far, what are you looking forward to about this topic?” (Responses will vary, but may include: I am looking forward to discovering how the Lost Children survived and how they found safety. I am looking forward to creating a story that uses my knowledge.)

- Acknowledge that some students may already know something about this topic. Explain that for homework, they will reflect on the guiding questions and how they feel about them based on their own experiences and that this will be discussed more at the beginning of the next lesson. And note that some students may know nothing about the topic—it will be fun to dig in together!

- Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target, using a checking for understanding technique—for example, using Thumb-O-Meter or Red Light, Green Light. Scan student responses, and make a note of students who might need support. Check in with them moving forward.

Work Time

C. Launch the Text: *A Long Walk to Water* (10 minutes)

- Distribute the text ***A Long Walk to Water*** by Linda Sue Park.

- Tell students they will now spend 2 minutes looking through the book with their partner and discussing what they notice and wonder about *A Long Walk to Water*. Partner B will share a notice or a wonder first, then partner A, and then partner B again, and so on.

- Provide **whiteboards** and **dry-erase markers** or **sticky notes** as an option for students to record (in drawing or writing) their ideas. This helps scaffold active listening for key details.

- Use equity sticks to select students to share out what they notice and wonder about the book.

- Pose the question to the class.

- After giving students think time, call on a student for an answer. Then, move the equity stick from one location to another, indicating that the student has participated in class that day.

- Draw and complete an I Notice/I Wonder T-chart on the board as students share. Listen for suggestions such as the following:

<!-- -->

- I notice that each chapter seems to have two different-colored fonts. I wonder how the two fonts are related to each other.

- I notice that the dates are given for each chapter.

- I notice that there is a message from the author and one of the characters from the book.

- I wonder how much of the story is made up and how much is real.

<!-- -->

- Ensure students notice the various text features in *A Long Walk to Water* (map, subtitle, dates in chapter headings, author’s note, and message from Salva). Briefly review the purpose of each text feature.

- Having spent some time looking through the book, invite students to spend 3 minutes reflecting silently. Reflection can include thinking or writing/drawing on paper. Students must be silent when they do this, though. Ask the following question to guide reflection:

“What does what you read or saw in the book make you think about? Why?” (Responses will vary.)

- Focus students on the **world map**. If students have not already mentioned this, explain that *A Long Walk to Water* takes place in Sudan. Using a total participation technique, invite responses from the group:

“Where is Sudan on the map?” (Students can describe or point to the country.)

- Place the labeled pin on Sudan, and explain that it is on the continent of Africa. Show students each of the continents on the map.

- Point to the pin marking your location.

- Ask students to Turn and Talk, and cold call students to share their responses with the whole group:

“Which continent do we live on?” (Responses will vary.)

“Where are we in relation to Sudan?” (Responses will vary.)

“Has anyone had any experience with Sudan that you would like to share?” (Sudan or neighboring countries may be the country of origin for some students.)

- Ensure students understand that Sudan is one country in the continent of Africa, which contains many countries, and this is one story in the history of Sudan. Emphasize that countries in Africa are all quite different and all have their own stories of success and challenge, just like we do in the United States. Help students recognize that what they are going to read about in *A Long Walk to Water* isn’t reflective of other countries in Africa.

Closing and Assessment

A. Reflect on Learning Targets – SL.7.1 (5 minutes)

- Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the learning target, using a checking for understanding technique—for example, using Thumb-O-Meter or Red Light, Green Light. Scan student responses, and make a note of students who might need support. Check in with them moving forward.

- Incorporate reflection on and awareness of the following academic mindsets: “I can succeed at this.” and “My ability and competence grow with my effort.”

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What helped you to be successful at that task? How much effort did you put in on this task? How did your effort affect your learning?” (Possible responses: I was successful at that task because I focused and worked hard. I also worked and talked with my peers, which grew my learning.)

- Distribute the **Homework Resources**, and review the format of the document and this lesson’s specific assignment with students.

For Lighter Support

- Strategically group ELLs with native and proficient English speakers, other ELLs, or by home language when placing them in pairs.

For Heavier Support

- Provide sentence stems to support the Think-Pair-Share, which will help students begin responding to the reflection on the connection between effort and success. Make the same sentence stems available the next time students participate in a similar reflection.

- I was successful at that task because . . .

- My effort helped me to . . .

Homework

A. Read and Reflect

- Students complete **Homework: Module Guiding Questions anchor chart** to read and reflect on the guiding questions for the module. With their family, they talk about how the questions make them feel and why, and what the questions make them think about. Students can sketch or write their reflections.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students should preread chapter 1 of *A Long Walk to Water* in preparation for studying the chapter in the next lesson.
