English Language Learners: Grade 7: Module 1: Unit 1: Teaching Notes

Build Background Knowledge: The Lost Boys of Sudan

Teaching Notes for Unit 1

Prioritize Lessons for Classrooms with Many ELLs

To prepare for the Unit 1 assessments, consider prioritizing and expanding instruction in Lessons 9–12, which introduce identifying and analyzing themes, answering text-dependent questions, and summarizing, and Lessons 13–14, in which students learn about and practice text-based discussion in preparation for the discussion of themes in the end of unit assessment. Prioritizing lessons on identifying theme, answering text-dependent questions, and summarizing is useful to ELLs because all of these tasks related to text analysis require the use of sophisticated academic language. This often needs to be directly taught to ELLs, who may not have as much familiarity with it as native speakers.

Language Dives

In Lesson 5, students are introduced to their first Language Dive, which invites them to use a single sentence to begin making connections between *A Long Walk to Water* and “The Lost Boys of the Sudan.” In subsequent Language Dive in Lesson 10, students are invited to explore the ways in which a single sentence can express themes and habits of characters, traceable throughout the entire novel. A Language Dive empowers students to analyze, understand, and use the language of academic sentences, which can often seem opaque to students. During a Language Dive, slow down for 10–20 minutes to examine the meaning, purpose, and structure of a compelling sentence from a complex text, model, learning target, checklist, or rubric included in the curriculum. This process invites students to unpack complex syntax, or “academic phrases,” as a way to build both literacy and habits of mind. Students then apply their understanding of language structure as they work toward the assessments and performance task. Through the Language Dive’s engaging Deconstruct-Reconstruct-Practice routine, students play with “chunks” of the sentence, interpreting them, rearranging them, and using them to talk about their own lives or lesson content. As a result of paying close attention to how language works, all students begin to acquire the necessary facility with academic English, and ELLs develop their overall language ability. A consistent Language Dive routine is critical in helping all students learn how to decipher complex sentences and write their own.

Diversity and Inclusion

Investigate the routines, practices, rituals, beliefs, norms, and experiences that are important to ELLs and their families. Integrate this background into the classroom as students explore the novel and informational text in the unit. An ideal context for inclusiveness emerges as students are invited to share their thoughts about chapters of *A Long Walk to Water*. Be sensitive to the fact that some ELLs and immigrant students may have firsthand experience of traumatic migration and immigration that mirrors those of the Sudanese characters in *A Long Walk to Water*. Foster inclusivity by creating space for students to express their feelings about sensitive issues embedded in the novel, knowing that these discussions may help create equity or unearth trauma or both. Consult with a guidance counselor, school social worker, or ESL teacher before discussing students’ experiences and for further investigation of diversity and inclusion.

Conversation Cues

Encourage productive and equitable conversation with Conversation Cues, which are questions to ask students that help achieve four goals:

- (Goal 1) encourage all students to talk and be understood;

- (Goal 2) listen carefully to one another and seek to understand;

- (Goal 3) deepen thinking; and

- (Goal 4) think with others to expand the conversation (adapted from Michaels, Sarah and O’Connor, Cathy. *Talk Science Primer*. TERC, 2012. http://inquiryproject.terc.edu/shared/pd/TalkScience_Primer.pdf. Based on Chapin, Suzanne, et al. *Classroom Discussions: Using Math Talk to Help Students Learn, Grades K–6*. 2nd ed., Math Solutions Publications, 2009).

Refer to the Tools Page (http://eled.org/tools) for the complete set of cues. Goal 1 Conversation Cues are introduced in Lesson 1, and suggestions for integrating Conversation Cues into instruction are presented across lessons. For ELLs, Conversation Cues are especially critical because they improve language processing abilities and increase engagement and participation.

Strategic Grouping

Students work in pairs and triads to analyze narrative and informational text and prepare for text-based discussions. Consider matching ELLs with a partner who has greater language proficiency. The conversations that happen as a result of such strategic pairing will greatly serve the language development of both partners. Once ELLs begin to converse with greater ease, change the grouping so that they interact with different students in the class.

Identify and Analyze Themes

Over the course of Unit 1, students receive explicit instruction in how to identify and analyze themes in narrative, using evidence from the text and prompts to guide their inquiry. Because recognizing and describing theme entails sophisticated academic language, which may be tricky for ELLs to understand, try approaching lessons connected to theme from multiple angles. Explain theme in relation to a familiar story, song, or film clip. Practice finding themes in a smaller section of text before asking students to find themes throughout the text. Demonstrate how to use the Common Themes in Literature handout. (Unit 1, Lesson 9) Also, provide multiple opportunities for students to locate recurring habits of character and behavior in *A Long Walk to Water* that can be grouped together and interpreted as themes.

Understand the Relation between Themes and Summaries

Students learn how to write summaries, as well as how to identify and analyze themes in this unit, and it is important for them to understand the relation between these two tasks—both how they are similar and how they are different. Lessons 9 and 10, which introduce the relationship between themes and summaries, are places where the same single paragraph of text from *A Long Walk to Water* could be used for identifying theme and for summarizing. Doing both these processes of text analysis with the same short piece of text enables ELLs to explore these processes in a context where the language demands are more manageable than they would be with multiple pages of text.

Text-Based Discussions

Students participate in two text-based discussions, during which they have the opportunity to discuss themes in *A Long Walk to Water*. Students complete a series of note-catchers to help them prepare for these discussions. This format is ideal for language development, as it invites students to orally negotiate with other students about the meaning of what they are trying to say, pushing them to change their language to be more comprehensible. Additionally, students can celebrate their successful attempts at communication and their ability to extend and enhance the discussions.

Differentiated Note-Catchers

Differentiated note-catchers are available for ELLs and other students who would benefit from an increased level of support. These resources have been modified for the purpose of reducing linguistic barriers that might interfere with processing content and concepts. Depending upon the task being carried out with a note-catcher, images, selected response options, answer banks, sentence frames, or model responses have been embedded to guide students’ thinking without compromising a focus on standards and the skills that students are developing and applying to meet them.

Celebration

Celebrate the courage, enthusiasm, diversity, and bilingual assets that ELLs bring to the classroom.

Selected Illustrations

Text illustrations can be used to support ELLs in many ways. Using illustrations before, during, and after reading can help ELLs match new vocabulary and unfamiliar words to concrete images. Making prelabeled illustrations available to students while they are writing can help ELLs better access the words they may need to describe a particular scene or character in their writing. As a sequence, illustrations can also be used by newcomers and emergent English speakers to elicit oral language through the retelling of the scenes depicted.

Eight illustrations, by Jim Averbeck, starting with the honey tree in chapter 4 and ending with the digging of the well in the close of *A Long Walk to Water*, have been included in the Unit 1, Lesson 6 Teacher Supporting Materials to scaffold ELLs’ comprehension of specific scenes and general understanding of the text.
