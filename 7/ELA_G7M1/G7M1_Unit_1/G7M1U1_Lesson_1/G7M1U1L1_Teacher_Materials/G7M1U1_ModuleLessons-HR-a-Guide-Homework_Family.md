![](media/image1.png) Guiding Questions and Big Ideas

Who are The Lost Boys of the Sudan, and what is their story?

- *The second Sudanese civil war displaced millions of people, including hundreds of thousands of Lost Boys who walked through southern Sudan, Ethiopia, and Kenya in search of a safe haven.*

What are the habits of character the Lost Boys used to survive?

- *The Lost Children persevered to overcome the hardships of war, starvation, thirst, displacement, and threats by wild animals. Many of them show respect, empathy, and integrity as they help each other survive these same hardships. Some of them have also become leaders in the United States or in their home country (like Salva and his organization Water for South Sudan), using their strengths to help others grow, helping care for their environment and shared spaces, and using their learning to do so.*

What will your student be doing at school?

Students begin Unit 1 reading the novel *A Long Walk to Water*.[^1] The focus of the first half of the unit of reading is catching questions about the conflict described, how the setting shapes the characters and plot, and how an author develops and contrasts the points of view of different characters in the text. In the second half of the unit, students begin to analyze how themes have developed throughout the story so far. Students also create discussion norms in order to have productive discussions about the text at the end of the unit.

Central to the EL Education curriculum is a focus on “habits of character” and social-emotional learning. Students work to become effective learners, developing mindsets and skills for success in college, career, and life (e.g., initiative, responsibility, perseverance, and collaboration); work to become ethical people, treating others well and standing up for what is right (e.g., empathy, integrity, respect, and compassion); and work to contribute to a better world, putting their learning to use to improve communities (e.g., citizenship and service).

In this unit, students focus on respect, empathy, and compassion as they respond to one another’s ideas and skills in written work and in discussions. During discussions, students also focus on collaboration and taking initiative. Also, they focus on integrity and perseverance as they work independently on assessments. As they track progress on their assessments, they take responsibility for their own learning.

How can you support your student at home?

Talk with your student about the Lost Boys and Girls of Sudan or other children/people displaced from their homes by war or disasters.

Read chapter books with your student, and discuss how the setting (time and place) develops the characters (people) and plot (events). Also, discuss the different points of view or opinions of the characters in the book and how the author develops those different points of view. Finally, discuss the theme or message the author is communicating through the book. You may use questions such as the following for your conversations:

- What is the setting of this story? How does the setting affect the characters? What must they do and be like to live in this setting?

- From whose point of view or perspective is this story told? How do we know? What is the character/narrator’s point of view of \_\_\_\_ (a topic/idea/character in the story)? How do we know?

- What is the theme of this story? What message is the author communicating? What lesson do the characters learn?

Unit 1: Homework

At the beginning of the unit for homework, students read the module guiding questions (listed above) and discuss them with a family member, talking about how the questions make them feel and why, and what the questions make them think about. Students can sketch or write their reflections. Also, students read chapter 1 of *A Long Walk to Water* to prepare for in-class reading and discussion of the chapter.

For homework in this unit, students answer selected response (multiple choice) questions about the plot (or events) happening in chapter 1 of *A Long Walk to Water*. Also, students read chapters of  
*A Long Walk to Water* to prepare for in-class reading and discussion of the chapters.

For homework in this unit, students use context (the words around a word) and, if necessary, a dictionary to determine the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary in chapters of *A Long Walk to Water*. Then students record the words and their definitions in the correct section of their vocabulary log. Also, students read chapters of *A Long Walk to Water* to prepare for in-class reading and discussion of the chapters.

In Lessons 9 and 15–16, homework focuses on research reading for which students read a topic-related book of choice and answer a question related to the unit’s ideas and skills.

**Research Reading:** When not reading their anchor text, your student is expected to independently research the topic by reading topic-related books of his or her choice for approximately 20 minutes each day and responding to a prompt of choice in the front of the independent reading journal. These are usually books your student will bring home from school; however, they may be topic-related books chosen by the student at the public or your home library. Prompts for independent reading can be found in the homework materials provided below.

Independent Reading

**Directions:** Remember to record responses to research reading in the front of your independent reading journal and responses to choice reading in the back. Try to choose a different prompt each time. Record any new vocabulary in your vocabulary log. Underline vocabulary found during independent reading.

**Record:**

- Date

- Title and author of your reading book

- Pages you have read

- Prompt

- Response

**Example:**

<u>Date:</u> 09/25/20

<u>Book Title and Author</u>: *A Long Walk to Water* by Linda Sue Park

<u>Pages Read:</u> 51–75

<u>Prompt:</u> How does the setting affect (character/person)? What kind of person does he/she have to be in that setting?

<u>Response:</u> The setting of the desert affects Salva by challenging him almost beyond his limits. He feels he cannot go on, but his uncle tells him to just walk “one painful step at a time” (54). Salva survives the desert with this help from his uncle. This setting makes Salva severely challenged and forces him to be strong, persevere, and rely on the support of others.

**Consider using the following independent reading prompts.**[^2]

- How does this text add to your understanding of one of the guiding questions of the module?

- How does the setting affect (character/person)? What kind of person does he/she have to be in that setting?

- What kind of events does (character/person) experience in the setting?

- From whose point of view is this part of the text told? How does the author develop this person’s/character’s point of view?

- How does reading from the author’s/character’s point of view help you understand something about Sudan?

- What theme or central idea is present in the text you read? Give text details that convey that theme or central idea.

- How does (character/person)’s experiences relate to Salva’s?

- How does (character/person)’s experiences relate to Nya’s?

- How does (character/person) grow and change?

- If you were (character/person), what would you do differently?

- Record two or three facts in your own words that you learned from the text.

- Summarize your research reading today in no more than five sentences.

- What questions do you have about the topic after reading?

- Choose one new word from your reading today and analyze it on a vocabulary square.

|                                               |                                        |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Definition in your own words                  | Synonyms (words with the same meaning) |
| Words with the same affix or root             | Sketch                                 |
| Translation in home language (if appropriate) |                                        |

Vocabulary

Directions: In the classroom, you have been recording words from your texts in your vocabulary log. Throughout this unit, you have been research reading topic-related books at home to build your knowledge of Sudan and recording words in your independent reading journal.

Choose a word from your research reading or from a text you’ve read in class and add the word to your vocabulary log. Try to choose a different word to add and to practice a different vocabulary strategy each time. For each word, be sure to add the following:

1.  The definition, or meaning, of the word

<!-- -->

12. The vocabulary strategy you used to figure out the meaning of the word

13. A sketch or diagram that helps you to better understand the meaning of the word

Record new vocabulary in vocabulary logs and mark academic vocabulary with a symbol, for example a star:

- Academic vocabulary: words you might find in informational texts on many different topics. For example, the words evidence and rationale are words that could be found in books on any topic.

- Domain-specific vocabulary: words about a particular topic. For example, the words tadpoles, frogspawn, and amphibian are some that would be found on the topic of frogs.

**Vocabulary Strategies**

As a reminder, the vocabulary strategies we’ve been working on in class are:

- Context: Read the sentence around the word.

- Look at the affixes for clues.

- Look at the root of the word for clues.

- Use a dictionary.

- Discuss the word with another person (after attempting some of the above strategies).

[^1]: *A Long Walk to Water* contains references to sensitive topics such as war (including the violent death of family members and children), displacement, family separation, hunger, thirst (including death from lack of water), refugee camps, violent deaths from wild animals, and serious illness of family members. The issues presented will be carefully and sensitively discussed to give students context as they read the story. You might speak with your student about this at home both before and after reading the book. Raise any concerns with the teacher.

[^2]: Some of the prompts will not be appropriate for the text students are reading. Invite students to choose a prompt that works for the text they have just read.
