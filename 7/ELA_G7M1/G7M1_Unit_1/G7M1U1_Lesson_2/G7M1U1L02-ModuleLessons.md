Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Instruction of focus assessment standards occurs in the following:

- L.7.4c – Opening A: Students practice using a dictionary as a strategy to determine the meanings of unfamiliar words.

- RL.7.1 – Work Time A: Students read the first chapter of the text and, in response to comprehension questions asked as they read, students cite several pieces of text-based evidence.

- In Opening B and Work Time A, students use the Think-Pair-Share protocol to engage in collaborative discussions about the module guiding questions and the habits of character reflected in *A Long Walk to Water*.

- In Work Time B, students also learn to synthesize each section of the chapter into a short gist (or general idea of what happens), which gives students an opportunity to make inferences and draw on the text for evidence. They record these gists on two differently colored sticky notes: one color for Nya’s section and the other color for Salva’s. They will continue to use these two colors to record the gists throughout the module so that they can easily distinguish the gists of different sections and trace plot, character, and theme development by rereading and sorting the gists. Students should record the chapter number and their initials on each sticky note to ensure their being returned to original order and owner.

- In this lesson, students begin the Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart as they focus on showing respect and empathy in response to the feelings of others about the module guiding questions in Opening B. Sharing their reflections is not mandatory—students do so only if they want to. Be sensitive to students’ and families’ feelings and experiences of the subject matter, including stories about refugees and war, and acknowledge that these feelings and experiences may differ greatly, from very positive to somewhat neutral to very negative. The main point students should understand by the end of this module is that people who have faced great adversity have rich and important stories and lessons to share.

- As students begin reading *A Long Walk to Water* in Work Time A, they note unfamiliar vocabulary in their vocabulary logs and they generate questions about the novel. These questions will be answered during research in Unit 2.

- The Think-Pair-Share protocol is used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- As students note vocabulary in the text, invite them to elaborate on the figurative and connotative meanings and uses of the words they find (RL.7.4). Provide opportunities for students to create new sentences using the words in their vocabulary logs.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students were introduced to the module topic by looking at resources in the Infer the Topic protocol. In this lesson, they formally begin to explore the topic by beginning to read *A Long Walk to Water*.

Support All Students

- Note there is a differentiated version of the Academic and Domain-Specific Vocabulary Form used in Opening A in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- In this lesson, students begin to discuss *A Long Walk to Water*. Analyzing a new text may be challenging for some students. To activate prior knowledge, review text structure with a familiar and less complex text such as a previous read-aloud or known text before the lesson. This helps students to generalize this skill with an unfamiliar text. ▲

- Because *A Long Walk to Water* is an unfamiliar text and may be above some students’ independent reading level, students may need supports to facilitate comprehension. If so, chunk parts of the reading selection for this lesson and use the Text Guide: *A Long Walk to Water* to check for understanding after each chunk. ▲

- When introducing the lesson, remind students that this is an unfamiliar text and that it is okay if they do not understand everything at first.

- Consider reading aloud the first several chapters of *A Long Walk to Water* in these first lessons to ensure student comprehension, engagement, and enjoyment of the text. However, if students are all already engaged, determine how students will read chapter 1 of *A Long Walk to Water* to best support their comprehension, or consider giving students choice to build empowerment and engagement in learning.

- Alternatives to read-alouds include the following: another fluent reader (including students or an audiobook) reads aloud to the whole class, small groups, triads, or pairs; individuals read silently; or a combination of any of these.

- The subject matter in this novel includes war, starvation, death, and extreme hardship, among other sensitive topics. Monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this chapter that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually.

- To support ELLs, this lesson introduces a vocabulary log for the systematic investigation of vocabulary, establishes an environment of respect for diverse perspectives, and demonstrates how to determine the gist of a chapter of narrative text.

- ELLs may find it challenging to determine the gist of the first chapter of *A Long Walk to Water* because of the volume of potentially unfamiliar new language in the chapter. Consider how strategic grouping could support this task.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.B.6, 7.I.B.8, 7.II.B.3, and 7.II.B.4.

Assessment Guidance

- Monitor students’ use of the vocabulary logs and the Questions about *A Long Walk to Water* anchor chart to ensure comprehension. Monitor students’ progress on writing gists during Work Time B.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue reading *A Long Walk to Water* and begin analyzing how the setting, characters, and plot interact in the text. Students will review the strategies used to answer the selected response questions assigned for homework from this lesson and also discuss point of view in the text.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare the following:

- Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart.

- Vocabulary logs: Vocabulary logs could consist of a notebook in which students glue forms in the front and back or a folder with several copies of the Academic and Domain-Specific Vocabulary Form clipped into the fasteners. Students will continue to use these logs throughout the year and will only need new ones when they have run out of space. However, to distinguish among the topics they study in each module, they will need to flag where one module ends and a new one begins. If logs are not prepared for students in advance, allot the final 10 minutes of the lesson for students to prepare them.

- Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 2 at each student’s workspace.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended in the first lesson of the module to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.7.4c (5 minutes)

- As students enter the classroom, invite them to respond to the questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 2**.

- Direct students’ attention to the posted learning targets, and select a volunteer to read them aloud:

“I can determine the difference between academic and domain-specific vocabulary.”

“I can show empathy and respect as I listen to my classmates.”

“I can use evidence from the text to find the gist of chapter 1 of *A Long Walk to Water*.”

- Invite students to Turn and Talk about the most important words in the learning targets, and underline or circle those words.

- Distribute **vocabulary logs**, and model the format for noting new words. Use the **Academic and Domain-Specific Vocabulary Form** ▲ **(example for reference)** for students who need extra support. Use the differentiated model to support students’ understanding of how and where to record new vocabulary words. ▲

- Focus students on the word *empathy*. Use total participation techniques to select students to share what they think it means. If they don’t know the meaning, share the strategies they could use to determine the meaning (context, affixes and roots, dictionary).

- Use a sentence frame to boost confidence and encourage participation (e.g., “Another word for *empathy* is \_\_\_\_\_.”). ▲

- Focus specifically on the use of reference materials such as **online or print dictionaries** as a strategy for determining the meanings of words. Ask students if they have experience using dictionaries to look up words. Model the process of looking up a definition, including pointing out the features of the dictionary (definition, etymology or word history, pronunciation). If there are multiple definitions of a word, invite students to share strategies for identifying the definition that best fits the context (identify what type of word it is, see if replacing the word with the definition makes sense in the sentence).

- With student support, record the meaning of the word on the **academic word wall**, with translations in students’ home languages (the ability to understand the feelings of others). Write synonyms or sketch a visual above each key term to scaffold students’ understanding. ▲

- Invite students to record this word in their vocabulary logs.

- Repeat this process with *respect* (consideration for the feelings of others). Provide students the meaning of *gist* (what the text is mostly about), and add the definition to the **domain-specific word wall**.

- At this time, address the prompts from the entrance ticket, and ask students to Turn and Talk:

“What does *academic* mean?” (having to do with school, learning, or study)

“What does *domain-specific* mean?” (relevant to a specific topic)

“What is the difference between the two?” (Academic words can be applied to any topic, while domain-specific words are usually relevant to a particular topic.)

- Ensure that students understand the difference between academic and domain-specific vocabulary by asking volunteers to give examples of academic words (words they might use in any class in school) and domain-specific words (math words, science words, literacy words, etc.).

- Turn and Talk:

“What words about the Lost Boys did you read or hear in Lesson 1? What topic or domain are these words from?” (Responses will vary but may include *war*, *Africa*, and *refugees*.)

“What do you think you will be doing in this lesson based on these learning targets?” (engaging in discussions with my classmates; summarizing chapter 1 of *A Long Walk to Water;* finding new vocabulary)

“Why are we doing this? How is it meaningful to you? How will it help you to be successful?” (We’re learning to listen to one another and show respect so we can learn new things from our classmates. We’re developing our ability to summarize texts to help us understand what the text is about as we read.)

For Lighter Support

- When presenting *empathy* as a sample word for the vocabulary log, display images that demonstrate empathy, and encourage students to use the images to help them infer the meaning of the word.

For Heavier Support

- Adapt work with the vocabulary log by adding other elements that may further help students develop their knowledge of a word. Examples follow below:

- Word and pronunciation: “What is the word, and how do you say it?”

- Forms of the word: “What are the different forms of the word?”

- Translation and cognate: “What is the translation in your home language?” “Does the word look like a similar word in your home language?”

- Synonyms and antonyms: “What words have a similar meaning?” “What words have the opposite meaning?”

- Collocations: “What other words are commonly used with the word?”

- Showing sentences: “Where else have you read or heard this word?” “What does it mean in the new sentence?”

Opening

B. Reflect on the Module Guiding Questions – SL.7.1 (10 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can show empathy and respect as I listen to my classmates.”

- Remind students that in the previous lesson they were introduced to the guiding questions for the module. Invite students to reread the **Module Guiding Questions anchor chart**.

- Explain that not all students will like the topic of the Lost Boys of Sudan or will have had positive experiences with their story. Ensure students understand that it is okay to have differing opinions.

- To help build trust, share a personal story regarding feelings about the Lost Boys of Sudan.

- Remind students that for homework they were asked to reflect on what those guiding questions mean to them and how they feel about them.

- Focus students on the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**. Explain that, as it says at the top of the chart, ethical people are people who treat others well and stand up for what is right.

- Read aloud the habit of character recorded:

“I show respect. This means I appreciate the abilities, qualities, and achievements of others and treat myself, others, and the environment with care.”

- Invite students to Turn and Talk to an elbow partner:

“Using the anchor chart as a guide, what does *respect* mean in your own words?” (appreciating what I and others are good at and treating everyone with care)

- Tell students they will now use the Think-Pair-Share protocol to discuss their ideas with a partner. Remind them that they used this protocol in Lesson 1, and review the steps as necessary.

“What does respect look like? What might you see when someone is showing respect toward someone else?” (See **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart** \[example for teacher reference\].)

“What does respect sound like? What might you hear when someone is showing respect toward someone else?” (See **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart** \[example for teacher reference\].)

- Read aloud the habit of character recorded on the Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart:

“I show empathy. This means I understand and I share or take into account the feelings, situation, or attitude of others.”

- Invite students to Turn and Talk to an elbow partner:

“Using the anchor chart as a guide, what does *empathy* mean in your own words?” (thinking about how others might feel)

- Tell students they will now use the Think-Pair-Share protocol to discuss their ideas with a partner:

“What does empathy look like? What might you see when someone is showing empathy toward someone else?” See **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart** (example for teacher reference).

“What does empathy sound like? What might you hear when someone is showing empathy toward someone else?” See **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart** (example for teacher reference).

- Tell students they will now have the opportunity to share their reflections, if they would like to, with the whole group. Remind students to respond with respect and empathy as necessary.

- Invite volunteers to share their reflections with the whole group. Be prepared to discuss any issues students feel they need to discuss further.

- Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target, using a checking for understanding technique—for example, using Thumb-O-Meter or Red Light, Green Light. Scan student responses, and make a note of students who might need support. Check in with them moving forward.

Work Time

A. Read *A Long Walk to Water*, Chapter 1 – RL.7.1 (20 minutes)

- Invite students to retrieve their copies of ***A Long Walk to Water***, and remind them of what they thought the text might be about.

- Invite students to turn to page 1. Read aloud chapter 1 as students read along silently. If students are able to read independently or in small groups, group students accordingly, and set the time for them to read chapter 1. As some students read independently, read aloud to students who need additional support, using the **Text Guide: *A Long Walk to Water*** for sample vocabulary and comprehension questions. Remind students that as they respond to the comprehension questions, they must use evidence from the text to support their ideas. If students do not finish reading the chapter within the allotted time, use the **Synopsis: *A Long Walk to Water***, **Chapter 1** document to review the key details from chapter 1.

- Ask students to note new vocabulary words in their vocabulary logs as they read the text.

- Give students 2 minutes to silently reflect on the text. Encourage them to consider how the chapter made them feel. They can write or sketch, or just sit and think.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What happened in this chapter?” (In 2008, an eleven-year-old girl named Nya is carrying a plastic container somewhere in southern Sudan, but we don’t know where. Also in southern Sudan in 1985, an eleven-year-old boy named Salva is sitting in a classroom thinking about being back home and playing with his brothers. Suddenly, there is the sound of gunshots outside the classroom and the teacher tells the students to run away. Salva knows that this must be part of the war being fought between the rebels and the government in the North, and he runs away from the school and into the bush.)

- Invite a student to paraphrase the key points in more comprehensible language for those who need heavier support.

- Capture any questions students have about what is happening in the chapter on a **Questions about *A Long Walk to Water*** **anchor chart**. This first day, encourage students to ask any question. As the weeks progress, guide students to refine the questions to better align to research questions. If necessary, for this lesson, provide sentence frames such as the following: “Who is . . . ?” “What is . . . ?” “How does . . . ?” “Why does . . . ?”

- Choose a page from the chapter, and invite students to suggest academic and domain-specific words on that page to check for understanding.

- Direct students’ attention to the Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart, and review respect and empathy as needed before inviting students to share their reflections if they choose.

Work Time

B. Find the Gist: *A Long Walk to Water*, Chapter 1 (5 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can use evidence from the text to find the gist of chapter 1 of *A Long Walk to Water*.”

- Distribute two different-colored **sticky notes** to each student, and explain that they will use one color to record the gist of Nya’s story and the other color to record the gist of Salva’s story. Also explain that students should write the chapter number and their initials on each sticky note. Remind students of their definition of *gist*, created earlier in the lesson (a gist is what something is mostly about.) Lead a whole-class discussion of what gist is and why we find it (to check our understanding of the text and to help us navigate back to places in the text quickly). Invite students to think of these key questions when deciding on the gist of a chapter or story: What are the main events? How is the plot unfolding?

- Model recording gist (key words, not full sentences) on a sticky note, and invite students to do the same, sticking them at the front of the chapter for quick reference. Have students Turn and Talk:

“What is the gist of this chapter? What is it mostly about?” (Nya: walking somewhere with container in the heat; Salva: in school, hears gunshots, runs away)

Closing and Assessment

A. Reflect on Learning Targets (5 minutes)

- Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the learning targets, using a checking for understanding technique—for example, using Thumb-O-Meter or Red Light, Green Light. Scan student responses, and make a note of students who might need support. Check in with them moving forward.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time. Invite students to share specific examples of where they saw other students showing respect and empathy and update the “What Does It Look Like?” and “What Does It Sound Like?” columns of the anchor chart accordingly.

- Incorporate reflection on and awareness of the following academic mindset: “I belong in this community.”

- Ask:

“How do empathy and respect help you feel a sense of belonging in this classroom community?” (Possible response: When my classmates listen to me and show they understand my feelings, I feel like I have a safe place in this classroom.)

For Lighter Support

- Remind students of the definitions of *respect* and *empathy* before asking them to reflect on how they foster a sense of belonging.

For Heavier Support

- Before asking students to reflect on *respect* and *empathy*, briefly describe concrete examples of respect and empathy that you have observed between students in the class during work time or in an earlier lesson. Then, explain that these are the type of interactions that you mean when you are referring to instances of empathy and respect. These concrete examples help ELLs to better understand abstract terms for values which are often difficult to convey in comprehensible language.

Homework

A. Answer Selected Response Questions

- Students complete **Homework: Selected Response Questions: *A Long Walk to Water***, answering selected response questions about plot unfolding in chapter 1 of *A Long Walk to Water* and identifying the strategies used to answer the questions.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students should preread chapter 2 of *A Long Walk to Water* in preparation for studying the chapter in the next lesson.
