- Akeer is taken to the clinic and gets well.

- The nurse explains that Akeer’s illness came from the water, and she suggests boiling it, but there isn’t enough water to do so.

- Salva’s group paddles across the Nile in canoes for hours.

- They arrive at a fishing community on an island in the middle of the Nile.

- Salva’s uncle is offered food because he is the leader of the group or perhaps because he has a gun.

- Salva eats sugar cane, fish, and yams.

- Sucking on a piece of sugar cane reminds Salva of eating mangos with his family.
