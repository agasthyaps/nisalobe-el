Chapter 8 of *A Long Walk to Water* shows good things happening to Nya and Salva, but difficulties still remain. Nya’s sister Akeer gets medicine and starts to feel better. However, the nurse explains that her disease came from the water. She says they need to boil the water to stay safe. This is not possible, though, because there is not enough of it.

This makes him miss his family. Even though there is good news for Salva and Nya, this chapter shows that life is still difficult for them.
