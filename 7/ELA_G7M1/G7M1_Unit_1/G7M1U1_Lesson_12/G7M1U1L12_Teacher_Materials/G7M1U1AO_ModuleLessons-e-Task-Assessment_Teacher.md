Chapter 9 of *A Long Walk to Water* by Linda Sue Park is about how Salva makes it through the desert with his uncle’s help, one step at a time. Crossing the desert was the hardest part of the journey for Salva. His shoes fall apart, his feet get wounded by thorns and stones, and he is so thirsty. Just when he thinks he cannot go on, his uncle appears at  
his side and tells him to walk to a clump of bushes just ahead, then some rocks, then a tree . . . In this way, step-by-step, Salva’s uncle leads him through his first day in the desert. This chapter introduces the theme that in challenging situations, it can be helpful to focus only on small steps.
