Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Repeated routines occur in the following:

- Opening B: Students review learning targets.

- Work Time A: Students read the next chapter of the text, noting unfamiliar vocabulary and the gist of the chapter.

- Closing and Assessment A: Students use the Think-Pair-Share protocol to engage in collaborative discussions about habits of character and academic mindsets.

- New skills are introduced in the following:

- Opening A: Students’ Mid-Unit 1 Assessments are returned with feedback to give students the opportunity to see how they performed in order to improve in their next assessment, and to ask questions if they don’t understand the feedback.

- Work Time B: Students work on Part I of their end of unit assessments, in which they answer questions related to the development of theme in chapter 9 as well as throughout the novel and write a brief summary of the chapter. (RL.7.1, RL.7.2, RL.7.10)

- The Think-Pair-Share protocol is used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- In the chapter of *A Long Walk to Water* read in this lesson, Salva’s uncle helps him continue on through the desert even though it is the hardest thing he has ever had to do, which demonstrates that Salva learns to persevere.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- In Work Time B, encourage those students who finish their end of unit assessments early to revise their short answer responses using the criteria they generated in the Criteria of an Effective Literary Summary anchor chart.

- Invite students to track the development of more than one theme evident in chapter 9. (RL.7.2)

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the lessons leading up to this end of unit assessment, students have answered scaffolded questions to analyze how an author develops theme in a text and support them in their writing of summaries. In this lesson, students continue this work by analyzing theme in chapter 9 and in the text as a whole.

Support All Students

- Students may need additional support with understanding the task and expectations of the end of unit assessment in Work Time B. Ensure understanding of the task before proceeding with individual work. ▲

- At this point, students should be reading the text independently. However, if some or all students need more support, read several pages aloud and then release students to read independently, in pairs, or in small groups.

- The subject matter in this chapter includes passage through a desert, which involves starvation, dehydration, and the deaths of strangers. Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this chapter that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually.

- Note there is a differentiated Synopsis: *A Long Walk to Water*, Chapter 9 ▲ used in Work Time A in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson provides opportunities for students to answer text-based questions about theme, write summaries, and complete a written assessment to demonstrate their understanding of these tasks.

- ELLs may find completing the summary section of the assessment challenging if they are not familiar with some of the language commonly used to connect thoughts. The design of previous lessons, which model and practice writing summaries, provides support for doing so in the context of an assessment.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standard 7.I.B.6.

Assessment Guidance

- All assessment materials (student prompt and teacher checklist) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback on this assessment, use the answer key and sample student responses (see Assessment Overview and Resources).

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue reading *A Long Walk to Water* and generate discussion norms in preparation for their text-based discussion of the first half of the novel, which will take place in Lessons 15–16.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Ensure Mid-Unit 1 Assessments with feedback and Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 12 are available at each student’s workspace.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous lessons to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Return Mid-Unit 1 Assessments (5 minutes)

- As students enter the classroom, invite them to respond to the questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 12** using their **Mid-Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Setting and Plot: *A Long Walk to Water***, **Chapter 6** with feedback.

- Circulate as students review their feedback, and offer guidance and support as necessary.

- Once all students are ready, invite them to share their “stars” and “stairs” with a partner. Remind students that everyone is working toward individual goals and that learning is about continued growth and development.

For Lighter Support

- Invite a student to paraphrase the key points of the distinction between discussing theme and summarizing. After one student has offered a paraphrase, encourage other students to build on his or her paraphrase with the following Conversation Cues:

- Who can repeat what your classmate said?

- She said \_\_\_\_\_.

- Who can tell us what your classmate said in your own words?

- He said that \_\_\_\_\_.

- These opportunities to paraphrase complex ideas provide ELLs with opportunities to stretch their listening and speaking skills and their capacity to manipulate academic language.

For Heavier Support

- To set themselves up for success for the end of unit assessment, students need to generalize the skills that they learned from previous sessions. Before administering the assessment, activate their prior knowledge by recalling the learning targets from previous sessions and the summary writing that they have already completed. Additionally, present the directions for the assessment both visually and verbally. Facilitate comprehension by displaying a map of the assessment parts.

Opening

B. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read *A Long Walk to Water*, Chapter 9 (10 minutes)

- Repeated routine: follow the same process as previous lessons for students to read chapter 9 of ***A Long Walk to Water***, using the **Text Guide: *A Long Walk to Water*** as necessary. For struggling readers only, if they do not finish reading the chapter within the allotted time, use the **Synopsis: *A Long Walk to Water***, **Chapter 9** ▲ as needed to ensure these students are able to practice paragraph writing in the assessment later in the lesson. ▲ Then have students identify the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary, reflect on their reading as they choose, and record the gist on **sticky notes** using the following resources as appropriate: **vocabulary logs**, **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**, and **Questions about *A Long Walk to Water*** **anchor chart**.

- Gists:

- **Nya:** strangers come to village to talk to chief about water

- **Salva:** can’t make it through desert but uncle tells him to walk step by step

- Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**, especially on *persevere*.

- Read aloud the habit of character recorded:

“I persevere. This means I challenge myself. When something is difficult or demanding, I keep trying and ask for help if I need it.” Invite students to Turn and Talk to their partner. Then cold call students to share: “Using the anchor chart as a guide, what does *persevere* mean?” (working hard through difficult tasks; not giving up)

“What does persevering look like? What might you see when a person is persevering?” (See Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart \[example for teacher reference\].)

“What does persevering sound like? What might you hear when a person is persevering?” (See Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart \[example for teacher reference\].)

- As students share, record their responses in the appropriate column on the Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart.

- Then ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“Which characters demonstrate perseverance in this chapter? How do they persevere?” (Salva and the other members of the groups demonstrate perseverance when they don’t give up and keep walking through the desert. Salva’s uncle helps him persevere by encouraging him to go one step at a time.)

Work Time

B. End of Unit 1 Assessment, Part I: Analyze Development of Theme: *A Long Walk to Water*, Chapter 9 (20 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify how themes in *A Long Walk to Water* have developed in chapter 9.” (RL.7.2)

“I can write an objective summary of chapter 9 of *A Long Walk to Water*.” (RL.7.1, RL.7.2)

- Tell students that, for this part of the assessment, they will analyze how themes are developed in chapter 9 of *A Long Walk to Water* and examine how the author develops themes throughout the text. They will also write an objective summary to show their understanding of the chapter.

- Distribute **End of Unit 1 Assessment, Part I: Analyze Development of Theme: *A Long Walk to Water***, **Chapter 9**.

- Read the prompt aloud as students follow along, reading silently. Answer clarifying questions.

- Focus students on the Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart, and review *perseverance* and what this looks and sounds like. Remind students that as they will be reading and answering questions independently for the assessment, they may need to practice perseverance.

- Remind students that since this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence.

- Invite students to begin the assessment. Remind them to refer to the following resources:

- **Common Themes in Literature handout**

- **Criteria of an Effective Literary Summary anchor chart**

- **Strategies to Answer Selected Response Questions anchor chart**

- While students are taking the assessment, circulate to monitor and document their test-taking skills.

Closing and Assessment

A. Reflect on Learning Targets (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

- Incorporate reflection on and awareness of the following academic mindsets: “I can succeed at this” and “My ability and competence grow with my effort.”

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What helped you to be successful at this assessment? How much effort did you put in on this task? How did your effort affect your learning?” (Possible responses: I was successful on the assessment because I focused and worked hard. I persevered even though it was hard.)

Homework

A. Preread Anchor Text

- Students should preread chapter 10 of *A Long Walk to Water* in preparation for studying the chapter in the next lesson.
