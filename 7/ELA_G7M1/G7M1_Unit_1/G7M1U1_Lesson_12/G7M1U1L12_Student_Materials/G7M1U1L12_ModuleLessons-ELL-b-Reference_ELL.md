**Chapter 9**

- Strangers come to Nya’s village to talk to the chief about water.

- Nya thinks the discussion is hopeless because the nearest water is the pond, which is half a morning’s walk away.

- Salva wears through his shoes in the dry desert, so he walks barefoot, struggling to breathe in the heat.

- Salva cries from exhaustion and a toenail injury.

- Salva’s uncles calls him by his full name, “Salva Mawien Dut Ariik,” which reminds him of his family and gives him strength.

- Salva’s uncle also supports him by giving his tamarind to chew on, and by making the journey step-by-step.

- They come across a group of dead and dying travelers.

- One woman from Salva’s group offers the travelers water, but others in the group say that it will do no good.
