<td><p>How do you know? How has the author developed this point of view?</p>
<p><strong>This is developed through the narrator describing Nya’s thoughts in response to her mother’s request, “Akeer, who was only five years old, was too small and walked too slowly.” (20)</strong></p></td>
<td><p>How do you know? How has the author developed this point of view?</p>
<p><strong>This is developed through the direct speech aimed not at Salva, but which Salva can hear. Many Dinka people speak and say things like,<br />
“He is a child. He will slow us down,” and “He is too young to do any real work—he’ll be of no help to us.” (21) It is then shown in Salva’s reaction to the direct speech as he hangs his head.</strong></p></td>
