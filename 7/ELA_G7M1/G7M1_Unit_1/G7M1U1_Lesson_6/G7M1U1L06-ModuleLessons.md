Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Repeated routines occur in the following:

- Opening A: Students review learning targets.

- Work Time A: Students read the next chapter of the text, noting unfamiliar vocabulary and the gist of the chapter.

- RL.7.3 – Work Time B: Students analyze how the setting shapes the characters and plot and add this analysis to the Setting/Characters/Plot anchor chart.

- New skills are introduced in the following:

- L.7.4c – Opening A: Entrance ticket activity provides students with practice in using the dictionary to determine the meanings of unfamiliar words.

- RI.7.10 – Closing and Assessment A: Students begin to read literary nonfiction texts at their level as they choose independent research reading texts. See Independent Reading Sample Plans located on the Tools Page (http://eled.org/tools) for ideas on how to launch independent reading. If there are existing routines for launching independent reading, in this lesson students will choose a research reading text.

- The Think-Pair-Share protocol is used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- In the chapter of *A Long Walk to Water* read in this lesson, Nya listens to her mother and takes her younger sister with her to the pond, which shows respect for her mother and for her sister. Also, the Dinka man and his wife who allow Salva to go with the group show empathy to Salva, understanding how alone and scared he feels.

- The research reading that students complete for homework helps build both their vocabulary and knowledge pertaining to the Lost Boys of Sudan and, specifically, the context of *A Long Walk to Water*. By participating in this volume of reading over time, students will develop a wide base of knowledge about the world and the words that help describe and make sense of this topic.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Allow those students who are identifying the gist and other elements quickly the opportunity to develop their own text-dependent questions about the chapter, related to the setting, characters, and plot as in Lesson 4. Ask these students to share their questions with the group as a way of generating discussion.

- In this lesson, students do not contrast the points of view of Salva and Nya, so students who need an extension could complete a QuickWrite similar to the one in Lesson 5 for chapter 4. (RL.7.6)

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students read chapters 1–3 of *A Long Walk to Water* and discussed the gist of the chapters, as well as how the setting shapes the characters and plot and the different points of view in the novel. Students also read an informational text, “The Lost Boys of Sudan,” related to the war in Sudan in Lesson 5, where they began making connections between the novel and related informational texts. Their independent research reading will allow them further opportunities to build on that work.

Support All Students

- Note there is a differentiated version of Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 6 used in Opening A in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. There is also a set of illustrations by artist Jim Averbeck of *A Long Walk to Water*, beginning with an illustration of the honey harvest scene in chapter 4. These illustrations may be used throughout the module to support ELLs and other students with comprehension of the novel, beginning in chapter 4 of *A Long Walk to Water*. Also, any students may access these images for the Performance Task children’s ebook they create if they cannot draw or find online images they can manipulate. ▲

- At this point, students should be reading the text independently. However, if some or all students need more support, read several pages aloud and then release students to read independently, in pairs, or in small groups.

- The subject matter in this chapter includes hunger and displacement. Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this chapter that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually. Students may need additional support rereading the text to determine the gist. Pair students strategically to ensure that each pair includes at least one strong reader.

- To support ELLs, this lesson introduces the concept of research, enables students to practice finding the gist, provides opportunities for discussion—which encourages students to hear diverse perspectives—and using evidence to support opinions.

- ELLs may find choosing independent reading and research reading for homework challenging if they are not familiar with the options in English. Be prepared to offer more guidance in this area or a variety of recommended options at students’ independent reading level.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.B.6, 7.I.B.7, 7.I.B.8, 7.II.B.3, and 7.II.B.4.

Assessment Guidance

- Check student gist statements to ensure they understand the chapter.

- Listen to student book discussions to identify common issues that can be used as whole-group teaching points against the criteria recorded on the Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue reading *A Long Walk to Water* and also continue their independent research reading for homework. Students will use the information gathered from these sources for the performance task of the module: creating an ebook about a Lost Boy of Sudan for elementary school-aged readers.

- The independent reading journals introduced in this lesson will be referred to throughout the module and the school year.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare independent reading journals.

- Review Independent Reading Sample Plans in preparation for launching independent reading in this lesson (see the Tools page at http://eled.org/tools).

- Ensure there is a copy of Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 6 at each student’s workspace.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous lessons to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing. ▲

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.7.4c (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 6** and **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 6** ▲ as necessary for students who need extra support. The differentiated entrance ticket supports students’ understanding with an image. ▲ Students will review their responses to the entrance ticket in Work Time A.

- Repeated routine: follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

- With students, use the vocabulary strategies on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart** to deconstruct the word *research* (the collecting of information about a topic). Record on the **academic word wall** with translations in home languages, where appropriate, and invite students to record in their **vocabulary logs**.

Work Time

A. Read *A Long Walk to Water*, Chapter 4 – RL.7.1 (15 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can demonstrate my understanding of chapter 4 of *A Long Walk to Water*.”

- Repeated routine: follow the same process as with previous lessons for students to read chapter 4 of ***A Long Walk to Water***, using the **Text Guide: *A Long Walk to Water*** as necessary. If students do not finish reading the chapter within the allotted time, use the **Synopsis: *A Long Walk to Water***, **Chapter 4** document to review the key details from chapter 4. Then have students identify the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary, reflect on their reading as they choose, and record the gist on **sticky notes** using the following resources as appropriate: vocabulary logs, **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**, **Questions about *A Long Walk to Water*** **anchor chart**.

- Gists:

- **Nya:** stops at home, goes back to pond with little sister Akeer

- **Salva:** leaves the old woman’s house, joins a new group of people escaping

- Once students have finished reading and reflecting on the chapter, remind them of the question from the entrance ticket, and use total participation techniques (**equity sticks**, cold calling) to select students to share their responses:

“The terrain changed from scrub to woodland; they walked among stands of stunted trees” (22–23).

“Use a print or online dictionary and copy the meaning of the word *stunted* as it is used in this sentence.” (Possible response: stopped or slowed the growth of)

- Invite a student to model for the group how they found the meaning of the word in either a **print or online dictionary**. Record the meaning on the **domain-specific word wall**. Ensure students understand that when looking up a definition in the dictionary, there are often multiple definitions of the same word, and so they need to read each one and think about which definition makes the most sense in the given context. Add the steps to the Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart.

- Then ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“Which habit of character does Nya show when she listens to her mother and takes her sister to the pond? Which habit of character do the Dinka woman and man show when they allow Salva to join their group?” (Possible response: Nya shows respect for her mother when she listens and takes her sister to the pond. The Dinka man and woman show empathy for Salva, understanding that he is alone and afraid.)

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time A, highlight some key sentences in individual copies of the text in advance. Explain that this keeps the gist in sight for students as they read along.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time A, in addition to highlighting some key sentences to help with finding the gist, read some of the selected sentences aloud and explain how they will help with finding the gist of the chapter.

Work Time

B. Analyze Setting, Characters, and Plot: *A Long Walk to Water*, Chapter 4 – RL.7.3 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: invite students to help complete the **Setting/Characters/Plot anchor chart**. Refer to the **Setting/Characters/Plot anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** for answers.

Closing and Assessment

A. Launch Independent Research Reading – RI.7.10 (20 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can select a research reading text that I want to read.”

- Launch independent reading. There is a suggested independent reading launch in **Independent Reading Sample Plans**.

- At the end of 5 minutes, distribute **independent reading journals**.

- Tell students they will use this journal to log their independent reading, both choice and research reading, and to answer reading prompts.

- Display the independent reading pages of the Unit 1 **Homework Resources (for families)**, and focus students on the information they need to record using the example on the same page.

- Model how to log independent reading without the prompt. Explain that they will log their research reading in the front of the book and choice reading in the back. Ensure that students understand the difference between independent research reading (topical texts) and choice reading (any texts they want to read).

- Explain that they will analyze the points of view of Nya and Salva in Chapter 4 of *A Long Walk to Water* using an organizer like the one they completed in a previous lesson.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- Display a model response for the prompt students will be answering in their journal. Ask students to make connections between the model and the prompt.

For Heavier Support

- For students who will benefit from hearing the texts read aloud multiple times, use a text-to-speech tool such as Natural Reader, SpeakIt! for Google Chrome, or the Safari Reader to record some options for independent and research reading. Note that to use a web-based text-to-speech tool like SpeakIt! or Safari Reader, an online doc will need to be created—for example, a Google Doc, containing the text. Also, offer audiobooks for independent reading. Providing audio support helps ELLs by giving them more than one way to access English text, as listening skills and reading skills in a second language can develop at different rates. For students whose listening skills are more developed in English, the audio supports their reading of the text as they follow along. Audio enables students whose English reading skills are more developed to hone their listening skills with the scaffold of the text. As students listen to the audio, they also learn how to pronounce words.

Homework

A. Analyze Point of View

- Students complete **Homework: Analyze Point of View: *A Long Walk to Water***, **Chapter 4**.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students should preread chapter 5 of *A Long Walk to Water* in preparation for studying the chapter in the next lesson.
