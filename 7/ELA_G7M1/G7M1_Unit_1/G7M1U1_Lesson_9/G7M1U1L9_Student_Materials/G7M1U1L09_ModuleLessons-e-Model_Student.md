Chapter 6 of *A Long Walk to Water* shows Nya and Salva struggling to survive dangerous environments. Both of their families help them, but sometimes this is not enough. Nya and her family have moved to a lake camp where life is difficult. Nya struggles to get water. She also realizes that her mother is afraid that the men in the family will become involved in the fighting near the camp. This shows how her mother is protective of the family. In Salva’s section, the struggle to survive continues. Salva’s uncle shoots an antelope for the group to eat. It is their first real meal in a long time, so it makes them sick. The group wanders a long time looking for water before going to sleep. When Salva wakes, his uncle tells him he has some bad news about his friend. Nya’s and Salva’s struggles show that even when people work together, nature can be overpowering.
