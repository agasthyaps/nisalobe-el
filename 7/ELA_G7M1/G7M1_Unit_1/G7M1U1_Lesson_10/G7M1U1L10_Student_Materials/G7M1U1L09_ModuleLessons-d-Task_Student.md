Common Themes in Literature

What is **theme**?

The **theme** of a book is the message or main idea relevant to the real world that the author wants the reader to take away from reading a literary text.

A theme has the following characteristics:

- It is a message or lesson about life that is broadly applicable—it can be true for situations beyond the story.

- It is a statement, not just a topic. That is, “friendship” is not a theme. However, “Friendship can bring comfort in times of hardship” could be a theme.

- Different books or movies can have similar themes. For example, the stories “Little Red Riding Hood” and “Hansel and Gretel” both convey the message that you should be careful about whom you trust, because people may not share their true intentions. The plots of these fairy tales are quite different, but their themes are similar.
