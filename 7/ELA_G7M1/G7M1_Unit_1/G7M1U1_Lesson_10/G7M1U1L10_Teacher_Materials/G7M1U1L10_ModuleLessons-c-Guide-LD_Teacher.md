(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

Every time Salva delivered a load of reeds, **he would pause for a few moments** to admire the skills of the boat-builders. (*A Long Walk to Water* by Linda Sue Park, p. 44)

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps to address the daily learning target (I can identify how themes in *A Long Walk to Water* have developed in chapter 7) and RL.7.2 by exploring the sentence’s connection to the theme: The Lost Children persevered to overcome the hardships of war, starvation, thirst, displacement, and threats by wild animals. Many of them show respect, empathy, and integrity as they help each other survive these same hardships.

- Supporting Standards: SL.7.1, L.7.4

- Guiding Question: The sentence helps respond to the guiding question (What are the habits of character the Lost Children used to survive?) by showing Salva’s respect for the boat-builders, and his own perseverance in delivering a load of reeds over and over again, as they work together to overcome hardships.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses the phrase **Every time** with a past clause (**Salva delivered a load of reeds**) and a “would” clause (**he would pause for a few moments**) with the purpose of conveying a past routine. Invite students to discuss each chunk briefly, but encourage extended conversation and practice with the focus structure: **he would pause for a few moments**.

- Practice and Transfer: After discussing the focus structure, students practice using it to discuss something in their lives. Students transfer their understanding of the meaning and structure of this sentence when identifying the theme of the text, when determining the habits of character that enabled Salva and others to survive, and during the End of Unit 1 Assessment when they write about themes.

- Delivery: Invite students to compare this sentence and focus structure practice with the previous Language Dive, which also includes a phrase that tells us something happens again and again (**Continually**) and a “would” clause conveying a past routine.

**Time**

10 minutes

Throughout the Language Dive

Encourage rich conversation among students about the meaning of each of the sentence chunk strips, what the academic phrases within each chunk mean, and how they relate to the sentence and the text overall. Monitor and guide conversation with total participation techniques and Conversation Cues.

After asking questions, provide students up to 1 minute of think time to reflect, depending on the complexity of the question. Alternatively, invite partners to discuss, providing an allocated time for each student.

Record and display student responses next to or underneath the target language for visual reference.

Although students should briefly discuss all chunks in each Language Dive sentence, invite them to slow down during one chunk, called the focus structure, to investigate and practice a particularly compelling language structure.

Where possible, place sketches, pictures, or illustrations above key nouns and verbs in the chunks after discussing their meanings. This allows students to quickly access the content of each chunk as they work with the structures in the sentence as a whole.

For translation work, invite students to use their online or paper translation dictionary if necessary. Invite students to add new vocabulary to their vocabulary logs.

Note: Some responses to questions in the Language Dive indicate only that “Responses will vary.” Like one the larger goals of Language Dives, “Responses will vary” is intended to suggest that students should be encouraged to grapple with questions and ideas, develop interest and participation, and not be immediately steered toward “correct” responses. Indeed, even where correct responses are provided, continue to invite a culture of inquiry and grappling.

**Key**

Green

Red

Launch

- Welcome students to their second Grade 7 Language Dive. Display the term **Language Dive**.

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partner. Say:

“Based on your first Language Dive, what do you think a Language Dive is?” (Responses will vary.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- If productive, cue students to clarify the conversation by confirming what they mean. If necessary, prompt students’ responses with sentence frames: “Yes, you’ve got it” or “No, sorry, that’s not what I mean. What I mean is \_\_\_\_\_.” Say:

“So, do you mean \_\_\_\_\_?” (Responses will vary.)

- Confirm or amend and display students’ ideas.

Deconstruct

- Remind students about the first step in the Deconstruct stage:

“When we do a Language Dive, first we read the sentence. We talk about what we think it means and how it might help us understand our guiding question.”

- Invite students to put their finger by this sentence from *A Long Walk to Water* on their note-catchers: **Every time Salva delivered a load of reeds, <u>he would pause for a few moments</u> to admire the skills of the boat-builders.**

- Read aloud the sentence twice, and then ask students to take turns reading the sentence aloud with their partners.

- Say:

“What does this sentence mean to you?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“How does this sentence add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

Every time

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following sentence chunk strip: **every time**

- Underline every time in green, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 🖉

- Tell students that highlighting language can help them notice important structures and patterns.

- Say:

“Why do authors put every time at the beginning of a sentence? What does it tell us about the next part of the sentence?” (Every time tells us that something happens over and over again. We know that whatever action is going to be described is done over and over again).

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- Say:

“Let’s talk about the second chunk.”

Salva delivered a load of reeds,

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **Salva delivered a load of reeds,**.

- Say:

“Who is this sentence about?” (Salva, one of the main characters in the book A Long Walk to Water)

“What did Salva do?” (He delivered something; delivered means to take something to a particular place or person.)

- Invite a student to use the word **deliver** in a context relevant to his or her life. For example, “The mailman **delivers** packages to my house.”

- Say:

“Is this happening now or did it happen in the past? How do you know?” (It happened in the past. We know because of the suffix -ed; -ed is used for regular past tense verbs, signaling that the author is describing something that already happened.)

“What did Salva deliver?” (A load of reeds: load means a large amount or a lot of something; reeds are tall plants like grass that grow in wet places; a load of reeds means a lot of tall grass-like plants.)

- Together with students, sketch **a load of reeds**.

- Say:

“What does this chunk tell us?” (Salva is taking a lot of tall grass-like plants to a place or person.)

- Invite students to pretend to be Salva delivering **a load of reeds**. Together with students, pantomime carrying an armload of invisible sticks from one place to another and dropping them on the ground.

- Focus students on the first two chunks together (**every time Salva delivered a load of reeds**).

- Say:

“Do these two chunks make sense on their own?” (No. They are dependent on the next chunks to make sense. We need to find out what happened every time Salva delivered a load of reeds.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- Say:

“Let’s talk about the third chunk.”

he would pause for a few moments

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **he would pause for a few moments.**

- Say:

“Who is he?” (He refers to Salva; we know because the previous chunk is about Salva.)

- Underline would pause in red, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 🖉

“What did Salva do?” (He would pause; pause means to stop doing something for a short time, before starting it again.)

“Why did the author use the word would?” (Would is used to express a repeated action in the past. It tells us Salva paused over and over again in the past.)

- Say:

“What does the phrase for a few moments tell us?” (For a few moments tells us how long Salva would pause. A few moments means a short amount of time; Salva would pause for a short amount of time.)

- Tell students that movement and acting out can help them figure out the meaning of sentences and chunks. Invite students to walk around the room. Then invite them to **pause for a few moments**. Repeat a few times.

- Say:

“When would Salva pause? How do we know?” (Salva would pause every time he delivered a load of reeds; we know because it told us in the previous chunks.)

“Why do you think Salva would pause for a few moments?” (Responses will vary, but may include that perhaps Salva was tired.)

- Point out that this chunk alone produces a complete sentence, but the first chunks give us more information about when Salva would pause (**every time he delivered a load of reeds**). Point out there is still another chunk left and, if time allows, consider asking students to guess what extra information might be added to the end of this sentence (**the reason Salva is pausing**).

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Tell students that now they have worked with the first three chunks, they will practice the focus structure:

“You’ve played with this chunk and figured out the meaning. Now let’s use the structure in the sentence for our own speaking and writing.”

- Display the sentence frame:

> **Every time I \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, I would \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**
>
> past tense verb
>
> (**Every time** + past clause + would clause.)

- Invite students to use this frame to talk about something they have done many times in the past. Give them time to think and discuss with their partners. Provide an example, “Every time I <u>took an exam</u>, I would <u>meditate first</u>.”

- Display the first Language Dive focus structure practice from the previous Language Dive:

> **Continually \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, I would \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**
>
> adjective phrase verb phrase

(**Continually +** adjective phrase **+ would** clause.)

- Say:

“How is this focus structure practice similar to the Language Dive focus structure practice from a previous lesson? (Both start with a phrase that tells us something happened over and over again \[continually and every time\], followed by a “would” clause to express a repeated action in the past.)

- Say:

“Let’s talk about the fourth chunk.”

to admire the skills of the boat-builders.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **to admire the skills of the boat-builders**.

- Say:

“What extra information does this chunk give us?” (We now know why Salva would pause. He would pause to admire the skills of the boat-builders.)

“What do we think admire means? What are some synonyms of admire?” (Admire means to respect or like someone or something because you think they or it is good. Synonyms for admire include respect, adore, and to hold in high esteem.)

- Focus students on **admire the skills of** and provide an example of someone who has skills you admire.

- Say:

“I admire the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ skills of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ because\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.” (For example, I admire the <u>writing</u> skills of <u>J.K. Rowling</u> because  
<u>I couldn’t put down the Harry Potter books</u>.)

- Say:

“What are the skills of the boat-builders?” (making boats; using reeds to make boats; weaving reeds)

“Why do you think Salva admires the skills of the boat-builders?” (because they make amazing boats and Salva doesn’t know how to build boats like that)

- Help students understand that when we admire someone’s skill, we often can’t do that skill as well as they can, but would like to be able to.

- Invite students to show on their face how they might look at someone they admire.

Every time Salva delivered a load of reeds, he would pause for a few moments to admire the skills of the boat-builders.

Reconstruct

- Say:

“You did well figuring out what all of the chunks mean, and why they’re important.”

- Remind students they will now go from the Deconstruct to the Reconstruct stage:

“Now that you’ve played with the chunks, let’s put them all back together again into a sentence. And let’s see how playing with the chunks adds to our understanding of the meaning of the sentence and our guiding question. Let’s see how reconstructing helps us understand how English works.”

- Point to and read aloud the entire sentence on display: **Every time Salva delivered a load of reeds, <u>he would pause for a few moments</u> to admire the skills of the boat-builders.**

- Say:

“What if we remove to admire the skills of the boat-builders? How would that change the meaning of the sentence?” (We would not know the reason Salva was pausing; we wouldn’t know what he was thinking.)

- Display the first Language Dive sentence from a previous lesson: **Continually under threat, they would flee for their lives, losing their way in the wilderness.**

- Say:

“How is this sentence similar to the previous Language Dive?” (Both sentences start with a phrase that tells us something happened over and over again \[continually and every time\], followed by a “would” clause, to express a repeated action in the past.)

“How is this sentence different from the previous Language Dive?” (The previous sentence started with the reason the boys would flee (they were continually under threat,) whereas this sentence ended with the reason Salva would pause (to admire the skills of the boat-builders.)

“In chapters 6 and 7, a lot of really hard things happen to Salva, including losing his friend Marial. However, he can still pause to admire the skills of the boat-builders. What does this tell us about Salva?” (Salva was still able to admire and respect the work of others, even in difficult times.)

“What habits of character is Salva demonstrating in this sentence?” (respect for the boat-builders; perseverance because he delivers the reeds over and over again)

- If productive, cue students to expand the conversation:

“Can you say more about that?” (Responses will vary.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- Say:

“What other questions can we ask that will help us understand this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses will vary.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

Practice

- Say:

“You did well putting the chunks back together again and talking about how this Language Dive has added to your understanding of the meaning of the sentence and the guiding question.”

- Remind students they will now go from the Reconstruct to the Practice stage:

“You’ve played with the sentence and figured out the meaning, and why it’s important to the guiding question. Now let’s start to use the language in the sentence for our own speaking and writing.”

- Display the sentence frame and highlight for students that **to** has been added to the sentence to mirror the original sentence from *A Long Walk to Water*:

> **Every time I \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, I would \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**
>
> past tense verb infinitive phrase
>
> (**Every time** + past clause + **would** clause + infinitive phrase.)

- Invite students to use this frame to build on the sentence they began earlier about something they have done many times in the past. Give them time to think and discuss with their partners. Build on your previous example, “Every time I <u>took an exam</u>, I would <u>meditate first</u> to <u>enter the exam with a calm mind</u>.”

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- If productive, cue students to clarify their sentences by confirming what they mean:

“So, do you mean \_\_\_\_\_?” (Responses will vary. Ensure that students are using the structure meaningfully.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- Congratulate students on completing the Language Dive to better understand the meaning of this sentence, how it connects to the guiding question, and how to use it in their own speaking and writing.
