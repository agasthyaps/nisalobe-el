Homework: Themes and Summary:  
*A Long Walk to Water*, Chapter 7

(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** An author can use characters, descriptions, and other tools to develop the theme in a chapter. Use the text to answer the questions below about how the author develops a theme in chapter 7 of *A Long Walk to Water*.

1.  Read this sentence from chapter 7:

“If it hadn’t been for Uncle, Salva might have gone crazy with fear” (41).

What theme in the text does this sentence help develop?

2.  Nature can present many challenges to humans.

3.  Dangerous situations can make people become leaders.

4.  <u>People need to depend on one another in order to survive.</u>

5.  People often do not appreciate what they have until it is gone.

6.  How are Nya’s and Salva’s uncles similar in this chapter? How does this develop the theme you identified in question 1?

Both are offering help to their family. Nya’s uncle tells them of a medical clinic for Akeer to go to, in the same way that Salva’s uncle comforts him and promises to protect him.

7.  How does the boat-building scene further develop the theme you identified above? Use examples from the text to support your answer.

The boat-building scene develops the theme that people need to depend on one another in order to survive because it shows everyone in the group playing a part to build the boats to cross the river. The author writes that “everyone was busy” and “some people were cutting down the tall papyrus grass” while others were bringing the stalks to the people who were building the boats (43). This scene shows the group working together to accomplish a goal, which is an example of how people must depend on one another in order to survive.

8.  (Thinking about Thinking) How are writing summaries and discussing themes in a text similar? How are they different? Use the example of the boat-building scene to think of this difference. If you were summarizing the scene, what would you write? What would you say if you were talking about the theme?

They both require you to find the big ideas or big events in a text and the details that are most important for developing them. However, a summary is just a description of events in a text, and discussing the theme requires you to go an “extra step” to find what the message of the text is, or what the author is trying to say in the text. For example, if I were to summarize the boat-building scene, I would say that the group stopped to build boats so they could cross the river. I would mention that everyone helped and maybe that Salva gathered lots of reeds. But when I’m discussing the theme of this scene, I say what the scene is meant to show about the characters and life in general. So, I would say that everyone working together shows that people must depend on one another in order to survive.
