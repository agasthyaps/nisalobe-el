Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Repeated routines occur in the following:

- Opening A: Students review learning targets.

- Work Time A: Students read the next chapter, noting unfamiliar vocabulary and the gist of the chapter.

- New skills are introduced in the following:

- L.7.4 – Opening A: Entrance ticket activity is to practice determining the meanings of words in context and to check their ideas in a dictionary.

- RL.7.3 – Work Time B: Students analyze how setting shapes character and plot as they answer text-dependent questions.

- RL.7.6 – Work Time B: Students analyze how the author develops and contrasts Nya’s and Salva’s points of view as they answer text-dependent questions and write a QuickWrite. This releases students to work more independently in preparation for the mid-unit assessment in the next lesson.

- The Think-Pair-Share protocol is used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- In the chapter of *A Long Walk to Water* read in this lesson, Marial shows he understands Salva’s loneliness and need to find his family, demonstrating empathy.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release more responsibility more quickly to students as they comprehend the tasks or concepts. For example, during Work Time B, release some students to read the chapter independently and record a gist and take notes about setting, character, plot, and point of view in their reading notebooks. These students may also begin to answer the text-dependent questions if they have enough time after finishing the reading and taking notes.

- Invite students to analyze other points of view in the chapter—for example, Marial’s—and to compare them to Salva’s point of view. (RL.7.6)

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students read chapter 4 of *A Long Walk to Water* and noted vocabulary and the gist of the chapter. They also launched independent research reading, which grows their background knowledge about the setting and historical events surrounding the characters in *A Long Walk to Water*. In this lesson, students continue reading and analyzing the novel. Students also continue their independent research reading for homework.

Support All Students

- Students may need additional support with vocabulary acquisition throughout the lesson. Provide ELL and home language online or print dictionaries to support students throughout the lesson. Students may also need support revising sentences in Work Time A. Provide models and guided practice along with gradual release to small group or partner work to support students. Also, students who need support with writing may need to use dictation software or a word processor throughout the lesson.

- At this point, students should be reading the text independently. However, if some or all students need more support, read several pages aloud and then release students to read independently, in pairs, or in small groups.

- The subject matter in this chapter includes war, separation from family, and the threat of wild animals. Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this chapter that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually.

- Note there is a differentiated version of Text-Dependent Questions: *A Long Walk to Water*, Chapter 5 used in Work Time B in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson provides strategic vocabulary instruction, guidance on revising the sentences, and opportunities to answer text-dependent questions.

- ELLs may find it challenging to identify and address problems in written sentence formation, but it is possible to teach this section of the lesson in a more directed format through preselecting specific sentences for students to work with.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.B.6, 7.I.B.7, 7.I.B.8, 7.II.B.3, and 7.II.B.

Assessment Guidance

- During and after the lesson, check students’ responses to text-dependent questions and QuickWrites to identify common issues to use as teaching points.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will complete their mid-unit assessment, focusing on using strategies to determine unfamiliar vocabulary and analyzing how setting shapes character and plot and how the author develops the points of view of different characters.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.7.4 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 7**.

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify strategies to determine the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary.”

- Once all students have completed the entrance ticket, use total participation techniques to select students to share their responses with the whole group.

- Remind students that when using a **dictionary**, there are often multiple definitions of a word, so they need to read each to see which fits best in the given context. Add *luscious* to the **academic word wall** with translations in home languages where appropriate, and invite students to add the word to their **vocabulary logs**.

- Repeated routine: follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read *A Long Walk to Water*, Chapter 5 (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: follow the same process as with previous lessons for students to read chapter 5 of ***A Long Walk to Water***, using the **Text Guide: *A Long Walk to Water*** as necessary. If students do not finish reading the chapter within the allotted time, use the **Synopsis: *A Long Walk to Water***, **Chapter 5** document to review the key details from chapter 5. Then have students identify the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary, reflect on their reading as they choose, and record the gist on **sticky notes** using the following resources as appropriate: vocabulary logs, **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**, and **Questions about *A Long Walk to Water*** **anchor chart**.

- Gists:

- **Nya:** family moves to lake; must dig hole and wait for water

- **Salva:** meets new friend Marial; walk together in lion-country

- Once students have finished reading and reflecting on the chapter, ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“Which habit of character does Marial show when he understands Salva’s loneliness and need to find his family?” (Possible response: Marial shows empathy when he understands Salva’s loneliness and need to find his family.)

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time A, encourage students to share the group consensus on the gist of the text.

For Heavier Support

- N/A

Work Time

B. Analyze Setting, Characters, Plot, and Point of View: *A Long Walk to Water*, Chapter 5 – RL.7.3, RL.7.6 (20 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze how the setting shapes the characters and plot in chapters 4 and 5 of *A Long Walk to Water*.”

“I can explain how the author develops and contrasts the points of view of Marial and Salva in chapter 5 of *A Long Walk to Water*.”

- Group students strategically into triads, and display and distribute **Text-Dependent Questions: *A Long Walk to Water***, **Chapter 5** and **Text-Dependent Questions: *A Long Walk to Water***, **Chapter 5** ▲ as necessary for students who need extra support. The differentiated note-catcher supports students’ analysis with suggested central ideas and sentence starters. ▲

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- N/A

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time B, when setting up triads to answer the text-dependent questions on chapter 5 of *A Long Walk to Water*, pair ELLs with native speakers who can effectively model the language necessary for answering the text-dependent questions. Because answering text-dependent questions often requires academic language, which may be less familiar to ELLs, giving them the opportunity to initially work with native speakers can provide valuable scaffolding. This assistance can be removed in later lessons as ELLs become more familiar with the academic language associated with text-dependent questions.

Closing and Assessment

A. Review: Text-Dependent Questions (5 minutes)

- Refocus the students as a whole group, and use a total participation technique to have students share their responses to the text-dependent questions. If time is tight, only review the QuickWrite and Point of View questions. During the share, record student responses on the **Setting/Characters/Plot anchor chart** and **Point of View anchor chart**. See **Text-Dependent Questions: *A Long Walk to Water***, **Chapter 5 (answers for teacher reference)**, **Setting/Characters/Plot anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**, and the **Point of View anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**.

Homework

A. Determine Meaning of Unfamiliar Vocabulary

- Students use context, word parts, and if necessary, a dictionary to determine the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary in chapter 5 of *A Long Walk to Water*. Then they record the words and their definitions in the correct section of their vocabulary log.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students should preread chapter 6 of *A Long Walk to Water* in preparation for studying the chapter in the next lesson.
