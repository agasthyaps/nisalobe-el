Use a print or online dictionary. Below, copy the meaning of the word **occurred** as it is used in this sentence. (L.7.4c, L.7.4d, L.7.6)

Sample student response: to take place; happen.

7.  Reread this sentence from page 31: “Their region was **inhabited** by large herds of antelope, wildebeest, gnus—and the lions that preyed on them.”

Break this down into affixes and roots, and use your affix list to determine the meaning of the word **inhabited**. (L.7.4b)

|        | Affix     | Meaning                |
|--------|-----------|------------------------|
| Prefix | **in-**   | **into, in, on, upon** |
| Root   | **habit** | **dwell, live**        |
| Suffix | **-ed**   | **past tense**         |

8.  How does the setting shape the characters and plot in chapter 5 of *A Long Walk to Water*? Use details from the text to support your response. (RL.7.1, RL.7.3)

The setting is . . .

In this setting Nya has to . . .

In this setting Nya has to be . . .

So the setting shapes Nya by making her . . .

In this setting Salva has to . . .

In this setting Salva has to be . . .

So the setting shapes Salva by making him . . .

Sample student response: The setting in chapter 5 is southern Sudan in 2008 and 1985. In both times, the setting is dry and dangerous. The setting shapes Nya because it shows her struggle to get water. Page 75 shows how first she has to dig a hole as long as her arm and then wait for the water to seep through the clay. This shows that Nya has to work hard to get water in a harsh setting. The setting shapes Salva’s character because he has to overcome the fear of being attacked by wild animals. The setting shapes the plot in 2008 because we learn about the dirty water Nya and her family have to drink, and it makes the reader wonder what might happen to the family after drinking this water. The setting shapes the plot in 1985 because we wonder whether Salva will be safe from the animals in the setting.
