End of Unit 1 Assessment, Part II: Text-Based Discussion: Themes: *A Long Walk to Water*

**Name:** **Date:**

After reading chapter 12 of *A Long Walk to Water*, you will update your Text-Based Discussion note-catcher with themes and evidence from the chapter in order to have a discussion in response to the following:

**Question:** How do Salva and Nya overcome adversity? What theme might the author be developing through these characters?

Your teacher will then organize you into groups to have this discussion. This discussion will be in a fishbowl, so while one group discusses in the middle, another group will watch around the outside.
