**Chapter 12**

- The villagers and the men work together to drill and make gravel from larger rocks.

- A crane comes.

- Nya still walks to the pond.

- Salva is mistaken—the woman in the orange headscarf is not his mother.

- Salva thinks that he is alone and that his family is dead.

- Salva decides he’ll get through life at the camp bit-by-bit, just like how he got through the desert.

- Six years pass and there are rumors that the camp is closing.

- The rumors turn out to be true and soldiers arrive in long lines of trucks, shooting guns and forcing the refugees to the Gilo River.

- The Gilo River is on the border between Ethiopia and Sudan, and it is filled with crocodiles.
