Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Two lessons have been allocated for this assessment to ensure sufficient time for students to discuss the themes in *A Long Walk to Water*. If these are taught in two separate lessons rather than together as one block, revisit the learning targets and the task at the beginning of the second 45-minute lesson to remind students of the task and purpose.

- Repeated routines occur in the following:

- Opening A: Students review learning targets.

- Work Time A: Students read the next chapter of the text, noting unfamiliar vocabulary and the gist of the chapter.

- SL.7.1 – Work Time A: Students engage in collaborative discussions as they use the Think-Pair-Share protocol to discuss the habits of character demonstrated in *A Long Walk to Water*.

- New skills are introduced in the following:

- Opening A: The entrance ticket activity prepares students to think about goals they have regarding collaborative discussions, including being prepared, following rules, and asking and answering questions relating to the topic.

- Work Time B: Students complete the end of unit assessment, in which they participate in a group discussion about themes in *A Long Walk to Water*, quoting accurately from the text to support their claims about theme development in the novel. (RL.7.1, RL.7.2, SL.7.1a, SL.7.1b, SL.7.1c)

- SL.7.1 – Closing and Assessment A: Track Progress folders and forms are introduced, and students reflect on their learning using the Track Progress: Collaborative Discussion recording form. This exercise is meant to provide them time to formally keep track of and reflect on their own learning. This self-reflection supports metacognition and pride in work and learning.

- Divide the class into two groups, and provide 25 minutes for each group’s discussion. When students are not involved in the discussions, they should assess their peers’ use of discussion norms and cues as well as the strength of their claims and evidence on the Peer Critique note-catcher. Assign each student a peer in the other group that they observe during the discussion.

- The Think-Pair-Share protocol is used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- In the chapter of *A Long Walk to Water* read in this lesson, Nya’s fellow villagers continue to work together to make gravel for the well, which demonstrates collaboration. Also, Salva continues to study, tries to find work, and braves the dangers of the Gilo River, which demonstrates his perseverance through hardships.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- In Work Time B, encourage students who can confidently participate in a discussion to be in the first discussion group so that they can model the discussion norms and cues as well as quoting accurately from the text to support strong claims. Challenge these students to focus on multiple themes that may or may not be related to adversity in order to allow the second group to have fresh material to discuss.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students prepared for this assessment by completing the Prepare for a Text-Based Discussion note-catcher with evidence of themes in *A Long Walk to Water*.

Support All Students

- At this point, students should be reading the text independently. However, if some or all students need more support, read several pages aloud and then release students to read independently, in pairs, or in small groups.

- The subject matter in this chapter includes death of family members, armed soldiers, a refugee camp, and threat of wild animals. Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this chapter that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually.

- Note there is a Synopsis: *A Long Walk to Water*, Chapter 12 ▲ from the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment. Some students may require more than the time allotted to complete the assessment.

- In Work Time B, encourage students to use the cues from the Discussion Norms handout as frames, writing down and rehearsing in pairs sentences and questions they would like to contribute to the discussion. Also, consider placing students who need additional support in the second group, so they have the advantage of seeing the cues and questions modeled. ▲

- To support ELLs, these lessons provide opportunities for students to participate in a Language Dive, continue working with a text-based discussion note-catcher, and participate in a discussion of theme, which serves as part of the end of unit assessment.

- ELLs may find filling out the Peer Critique note-catcher during Work Time B challenging because it may be difficult for them to follow a quick-moving discussion in English while simultaneously taking notes on the discussion. If so, use the lighter and heavier supports below to scaffold this activity.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.1.A.1, 7.1.A.3, 7.I.B.5, and 7.I.B.6.

Assessment Guidance

- Assessment materials (student copy, answer key, student exemplar, teacher checklist) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback to students on this assessment, use the Collaborative Discussion checklist (see Assessment Overview and Resources) to complete the student Track Progress recording form. Optionally make notes in the appropriate column for each criterion in a different color from student responses. There is also space provided to respond to student comments.

- In this assessment, students are tracking progress toward anchor standard:

- SL.1: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: prepare for and participate effectively in a range of conversations and collaborations with diverse partners, building on others’ ideas and expressing my own clearly and persuasively.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will begin Unit 2 by closely reading an informational text about the Lost Girls of Sudan and relating the ideas in the article to the novel *A Long Walk to Water* and to the informational text they read in this unit, “The Lost Boys of the Sudan.”

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare:

- The End of Unit 1 Assessment (see Assessment Overview and Resources)

- Designate the two discussion groups, dividing the class roughly in half. Assign students who are ready for a challenge to the first discussion group and those who need more support to the second discussion group for modeling purposes. ▲ Post the group designations.

- Track Progress folder for each student. This will be a folder with eight tabs, one for each type of Track Progress sheet students will complete: Collaborative Discussion, Informative Writing, Narrative Writing, Opinion Writing, Reading, Understanding and Explaining New Text, Reading Fluency, and Research. Students will keep their Track Progress forms in this folder to refer to the relevant form before completing an assessment.

- Review the Fishbowl protocol (refer to Classroom Protocols document located on the Tools Page at http://eled.org/tools). Arrange the desks with half the chairs/desks in a center circle and the other half in an outer circle.

- Ensure there is a copy of Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 15 at each student’s workspace.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time B: Students may complete their note-catchers

- using a word-processing tool—for example, a Google Doc or

- in a word-processing document—for example, a Google Doc—using Speech to Text facilities activated on devices or using an app or software such as http://eled.org/0103.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 15**. Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique to review their responses.

- Repeated routine: follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

- With students, use the vocabulary strategies on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart** to deconstruct the words *quote* (to repeat a passage or information from a source), *support* (to provide evidence or proof for), *norms* (a model or standard that is generally followed), and *effective* (successful, useful). Record on the **academic word wall** with translations in home languages, where appropriate, and invite students to record words in their **vocabulary logs**.

Work Time

A. Read *A Long Walk to Water*, Chapter 12 – SL.7.1 (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: follow the same process as previous lessons for students to read chapter 12 of ***A Long Walk to Water***, using the **Text Guide: *A Long Walk to Water*** as necessary. If students do not finish reading the chapter within the allotted time, use the **Synopsis: *A Long Walk to Water***, **Chapter 12** ▲ as needed to ensure these students are able to practice paragraph writing later in the lesson. ▲ Then have students identify the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary, reflect on their reading as they choose, and record the gist on **sticky notes** using the following resources as appropriate: vocabulary logs, **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**, and **Questions about *A Long Walk to Water*** **anchor chart**.

- Gists:

- **Nya:** crane comes; villagers making gravel; Nya still walks to pond

- **Salva:** family dead; at camp for 6 years; soldiers chase to river with crocodiles

- Once students have finished reading and reflecting on the chapter, ask them to Think-Pair-Share:

“Which habits of character did you see in this chapter? Who demonstrated them? What did they look or sound like?” (Possible response: Nya’s fellow villagers continue to collaborate to make gravel for the well. Also, Salva perseveres to study, find work, and braves the Gilo River.)

- Invite students to update their **Prepare for a Text-Based Discussion: Themes: *A Long Walk to Water*** **note-catcher** with additional evidence from chapter 12 as appropriate.

Work Time

B. End of Unit 1 Assessment, Part II: Text-Based Discussion: Themes: *A Long Walk to Water* (55 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can quote accurately from the text to support my ideas during a text-based discussion.”

“I can follow discussion norms to have an effective text-based discussion.”

- Distribute **End of Unit 1 Assessment, Part II: Text-Based Discussion: Themes: *A Long Walk to Water***.

- Read aloud the directions for each part of the assessment as students silently follow along. Read, reread, and rephrase. Answer clarifying questions.

- Tell students that while they are waiting to participate in the discussion, they are to assess their peers’ (as a group) use of discussion norms and cues as well as the strength of their claims and evidence on the **Peer Critique note-catcher**. Distribute the note-catcher and read it aloud, asking students to follow along and annotate for new and important ideas. If necessary, model completing the note-catcher by asking volunteers to simulate a discussion, using a Think Aloud and filling in the applicable columns. Ensure students understand that rather than focusing on one individual student, students on the outside of the fishbowl should be looking across the whole group for evidence of norms to provide feedback.

- Focus students on all of the characteristics on the Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart (respect, compassion, and empathy) in preparation for the discussion. Review what each characteristic looks and sounds like.

- Focus students on the **Discussion Norms anchor chart**, specifically on the cues and responses. Remind them that a discussion is not just about saying what they want to say and then they are done. Effective participation is about listening to others and asking and answering questions to be completely clear about what others are saying and to clarify their own points.

- Also, direct students’ attention to the **Quote Accurately from the Text** handout. As necessary, review different examples of quoting accurately from the novel during a discussion.

- Ensure all students understand the assessment directions. Answer their questions, refraining from supplying answers to the assessment questions themselves.

- Begin the fishbowl conversation. Invite the first group of students (roughly half the class) to sit in the center circle with their novels and note-catchers, and begin the discussion. Allocate each group 25 minutes for discussion.

- Invite the remaining students to sit in the outer circle with the Peer Critique note-catcher, and observe and assess the discussion.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time B, when students fill out the Peer Critique note-catcher, give them the option of focusing on a few students or all the students participating in the conversation. Focusing on just a few students will make the task more manageable for ELLs, who may have trouble simultaneously following a fast-paced discussion and recording notes on all the participants.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time B, instead of using the Peer Critique note-catcher, provide students with a short list of things they should be able to observe their peers doing during conversation, and have them check off the behaviors when they notice them. The list might include using examples from the text to support ideas, following discussion norms, adding more about their ideas or others’ ideas, etc. Using the list instead of the Peer Critique note-catcher allows ELLs to focus their attention on understanding the conversation, since they will not need to listen and write simultaneously.

Closing and Assessment

A. Track Progress (15 minutes)

- Give students specific positive feedback on their completion of the end of unit assessment. (Example: “I heard a lot of you asking clarifying questions or questions to find out more.”)

- Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**, especially on *responsibility*.

- Read aloud the habit of character recorded:

“I take responsibility. This means I take ownership of my ideas, my work, my goals, and my actions.”

- Invite students to Turn and Talk to their partner. Then cold call students to share:

“Using the anchor chart as a guide, what does *responsibility* mean?” (taking charge of myself)

“What does responsibility look like? What might you see when a person is taking responsibility?” (See Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart \[example for teacher reference\].)

“What does responsibility sound like? What might you hear when a person is taking responsibility?” (See Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart \[example for teacher reference\].)

- Record students’ responses in the appropriate column on the Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart.

- Tell students that they will take responsibility for their own learning as they track their progress.

- Give students specific positive feedback on their completion of the end of unit assessment. (Example: “I was pleased to see a lot of you referring back to your texts to find details.”)

- Distribute **Track Progress: Collaborative Discussion**, **Track Progress folders**, and sticky notes. Tell students that successful learners keep track of and reflect on their own learning and that they will be completing a form like this after most of their assessments. Tell students that this helps to build responsibility for their work and learning. Select volunteers to read aloud each criterion for the whole group. After hearing each one read aloud, invite students to Turn and Talk with an elbow partner:

“What does that criterion mean in your own words?” (Responses will vary.)

- Read the directions aloud for students, and answer clarifying questions. Explain the scale and what each number represents. They should give themselves a 3 if they think they have achieved that criterion in their reading of new texts, a 4 if they think they have done even more than the criterion asks, a 2 if they think they are nearly there but not quite, and a 1 if they think they still have a lot of work to do.

- Distribute sticky notes. Tell students the sticky notes are for them to find evidence in their assessment work of the following criteria:

- SL.7.1a: I came to the discussion prepared with ideas and evidence to the prompt.

- SL.7.1a: I referred to my evidence in the discussion and reflected on ideas in the discussion.

- Guide students through completing question 1 of the Track Progress form. If this is the first time students have completed this form, they may not be able to answer this question. In this situation, tell students to leave it blank and explain that the next time they fill out the same form, they should be able to answer this question. If students completed these forms in Grade 6, they will be able to look back to their Grade 6 forms.

- Point out the Teacher Response part under question 2, and tell students that after class, each student’s reflection will be reviewed and feedback about their progress toward the skill will be added.

- Direct students’ attention to question 3 on the form, and select a volunteer to read it aloud for the group:

“How can I improve next time?”

- Invite students to reflect on their own or with a partner on how they can improve on this skill in the future. Select volunteers to share with the group. Invite students to record their thinking in the appropriate spot on the Track Progress form. Invite students to place the form in their Track Progress folder, and collect students’ folders.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their independent reading journal.
