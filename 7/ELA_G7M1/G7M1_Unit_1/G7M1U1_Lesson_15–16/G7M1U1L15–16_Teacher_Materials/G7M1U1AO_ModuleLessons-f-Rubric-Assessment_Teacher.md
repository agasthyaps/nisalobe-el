Copy one checklist for each discussion group. Record your observations using the following key:

1 = Beginning 2 = Developing 3 = Proficient 4 = Advanced

Write an objective summary of chapter 9 of *A Long Walk to Water*. (RL.7.1, RL.7.2)

Be sure that your summary:

- introduces the text with the title and author and “wraps up” with a concluding statement,

- uses relevant events and important details from the text to explain what happens, and

- is clear and concise.

Responses will vary. A sample objective summary is included below.

Chapter 9 of *A Long Walk to Water* by Linda Sue Park is about how Salva makes it through the desert with his uncle’s help, one step at a time. Crossing the desert was the hardest part of the journey for Salva. His shoes fall apart, his feet get wounded by thorns and stones, and he is so thirsty. Just when he thinks he cannot go on, his uncle appears at his side and tells him to walk to a clump of bushes just ahead, then some rocks, then a tree . . . In this way, step-by-step, Salva’s uncle leads him through his first day in the desert. This chapter introduces the theme that in challenging situations, it can be helpful to focus only on small steps.

Note: This task is not being assessed against the writing standards. Use the following rubric and the sample response to assess the content of the summary and evaluate the student’s understanding of the chapter.
