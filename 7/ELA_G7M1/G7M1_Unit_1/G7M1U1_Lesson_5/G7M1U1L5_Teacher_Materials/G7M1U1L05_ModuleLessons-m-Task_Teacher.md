Both the article and the book show . . .

Also, the article and book both show . . .

Sample student response: Both the article and the book show the difficulties of the Lost Boys’ journeys. In the article, the author describes how the boys spent four years “wandering in and out of war zones.” In the book, the author writes that the boys tried to avoid the rebels. That is because anywhere the rebels were, “there was sure to be fighting” (12).

Both examples show how the Lost Boys had to face the difficulties of war.
