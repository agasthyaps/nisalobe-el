Close Reading Guide:  
“The Lost Boys of the Sudan”

RI.7.2, RI.7.4

(For Teacher Reference)

**Purpose and Notes**

- The purpose of this close read is for students to trace the way the author develops the two central ideas of the article.

- In this close read, students will focus only on the selected sections of the text, which are related to the two central ideas.

- For the sake of time, first read aloud the text.

- After the text is first read aloud, students reread portions of the text as they answer text-dependent questions.

- A note-catcher along with text-dependent questions provide an opportunity for students to determine the two central ideas by first drawing out the common details that are related to each central idea.

- Continue to use discussion protocols (e.g., Think-Pair-Share, Conversation Cues, and total participation techniques) to engage all students in collaborative discussion about the text.

<td>Reread the first paragraph from “Since 1983, the Sudan People’s Liberation Army (SPLA) and the Sudanese Government . . .” to “The survivors are now in camps in Kenya, the Sudan and Uganda.”</td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Ask: “What is the gist of this paragraph? What purpose does the paragraph serve in the article?” (The gist of the article is that a war in southern Sudan has had an enormous effect on people. It has forced around 20,000 boys to walk “enormous distances” to try and find safety. This paragraph helps provide context for the rest of the article.)</p></li>
<li><p>Display the <strong>Close Read: “The Lost Boys of the Sudan” note-catcher</strong>, and direct students’ attention to the box labeled “Vocabulary” at the bottom of the note-catcher. Focus students on the sentence <strong>“The conflict has already claimed more than 500,000 lives and displaced huge numbers of people.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “What details in this paragraph help you to understand the word <strong>displaced</strong> as it is used in this context? How can you use the parts of the words and your affix list to also help you understand the word?” (Students should mention words like “separated from their families”; “trekked enormous distances”; “crossed from the Sudan into Ethiopia and back”; “now in camps in Kenya, the Sudan, and Uganda.” The word can be broken down into <strong>dis-</strong> and <strong>placed</strong>, meaning to be forced to leave one’s home.) Together, as a class, add these clues and definition to the bottom of the note-catcher, in the box labeled “Vocabulary.”</p></li>

<td>Read paragraph 2.</td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>On the Close Read: “The Lost Boys of the Sudan” note-catcher, direct students’ attention to the box labeled “Paragraph 2.” Focus student attention on the first sentence, <strong>“This extraordinary exodus has its origins in traditional forms of migration,”</strong> and ask them to underline it. Inform students that they will now use context clues and supporting details to clarify the meaning of the sentence and then rephrase it in their own words.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “Which words or phrases in this paragraph provide context clues for understanding the meaning of <strong>extraordinary exodus</strong> in this sentence?” (Students should identify words like <strong>migration</strong>; <strong>mobile</strong>; <strong>leave home</strong>; <strong>head for towns or cities</strong>; <strong>before returning home</strong>; <strong>send their children elsewhere</strong>.) If students need support, remind them to use word parts (<strong>ex-odus</strong> related to <strong>ex-it</strong>) to determine the meaning of the word. (RI.7.4)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “What does the author mean by ‘traditional forms of migration’? What details in the text help you understand this phrase?” (The phrase means common ways of moving around. The author mentions that “young adolescent boys . . . have generally been quite mobile.” These boys “would leave home” before “eventually returning home.”)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “Using this understanding, how would we rephrase this key sentence?” (Refer to the <strong>Close Read: “The Lost Boys of the Sudan” note-catcher [example for teacher reference]</strong> for sample response.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask students which sentence best conveys the main idea in this paragraph. Students should identify the sentence: <strong>This extraordinary exodus has its origins in traditional forms of migration.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “How can you express this main idea in your own words? What details does the author use to support this idea?” (Refer to the Close Read: “The Lost Boys of the Sudan” note-catcher [example for teacher reference] for sample answers.)</p></li>
<li><p>Together, as a class, add the main idea and details to the note-catcher in the Paragraph 2 box.</p></li>

<td>Read paragraph 3 from “But during the war this process has escalated dramatically” to “. . . had to resort to begging or petty crime.”</td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Focus student attention on the sentence <strong>“But during the war this process has escalated dramatically.”</strong> Instruct students to underline it. Tell students that they will now use supporting details to clarify the meaning of the sentence and then rephrase it in their own words.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “What ‘process’ is the author referring to in the first sentence of this paragraph? Where can we look for clues?” (We know that <strong>process</strong> refers to migration because the author is referring to the previous paragraph. The author starts the paragraph with “but” to clarify a previous point. This sentence is about how the migration caused by the war was different than previous kinds of migration. The author clarifies this by writing about how “many boys left their villages” to get away from the fighting.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “What does the phrase <strong>escalated dramatically</strong> say about the migration the boys were participating in?” (That it increased by a lot; it was much different than before.)</p></li>
<li><p>Direct students’ attention to the sections on their note-catcher labeled “Hopes or Expectations” and “Realities.” Invite students to work with a partner to identify the details in this paragraph that show what the Lost Boys’ hopes about their journey were versus what actually happened. Instruct students to add those details to the “Hopes or Expectations” versus “Realities” section. Review student annotations using details added in the Close Read: “The Lost Boys of the Sudan” note-catcher (example for teacher reference). Students may add details they may have missed.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “What is the main idea of this paragraph?” (More boys were forced to migrate than usual. This migration turned out differently than they expected and was very dangerous.) “How does looking at these hopes and expectations versus reality help us better understand the main idea discussed in this paragraph?” (Looking at the details shows that the boys hoped to find work or schooling, like they normally might on a journey, but instead they were forced into “begging” or “petty crime” because of how many boys there were. This shows how this migration was much larger and more difficult.)</p></li>
<li><p>Invite students to write the main idea of paragraph 3 on their note-catcher. Refer to the Close Read: “The Lost Boys of the Sudan” note-catcher (example for teacher reference) for sample response.</p></li>

<td>Read the paragraph 4 from “Others set out for refugee camps. . .” to “. . . to soldiers, swindlers or bandits.”</td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Direct students’ attention to the box labeled “Vocabulary” at the bottom of the note-catcher. Focus students on the sentence: <strong>“They believed the trek would last only a few days and discovered that they faced a harrowing journey of 6 to 10 weeks.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “What clues in this paragraph help you to understand the word <strong>harrowing</strong> as it is used in this context?” (“Continually under threat”; “losing their way in the wilderness”)</p></li>
<li><p>Invite students to work with a partner to identify additional details in paragraph 4 that show what the Lost Boys’ hopes about their journey were versus what actually happened. Instruct students to add those details to the “Hopes or Expectations” versus “Realities” section. Review student annotations using example details in the Close Read: “The Lost Boys of the Sudan” note-catcher (example for teacher reference). Students may add details they may have missed.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask students to underline the sentence in this paragraph that best expresses that the realities of the journey were different from what they expected. (Students should identify the sentence: “Few had any idea of what lay ahead of them.”)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “How can you express the main idea of paragraphs 3 and 4 in your own words? What details does the author use to support this idea?”</p></li>
<li><p>Refer to the Close Read: “The Lost Boys of the Sudan” note-catcher (example for teacher reference) for sample answers.</p></li>
<li><p>Invite students to add the main idea and additional supporting details to the note-catcher in the paragraphs 3 and 4 box.</p></li>
<li><p>Invite students to review their note-catchers to reflect on the following question: “What central ideas has the author introduced in the article so far?”</p></li>
<li><p>Ask students to write a sentence summarizing the two central ideas they’ve identified so far in the appropriate spot on their note-catchers. (Refer to the Close Read: “The Lost Boys of the Sudan” note-catcher [example for teacher reference] for sample answers.)</p></li>
<li><p>Discuss responses as a class. Encourage students to revise as needed.</p></li>

<li><p>Focus students on the key sentences <strong>“The survivors who reached the camps in Ethiopia started to lead a relatively peaceful life. But it was not to last.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Invite students to work with partners to identify and orally share the details in the paragraph that support this idea.</p></li>
<li><p>Instruct students to answer the question on their note-catcher: How do these sentences and supporting details further develop the central ideas you’ve identified in the text?</p></li>
<li><p>Ask students to focus on these sentences in the final paragraph: <strong>“But approximately 17,000 remain in camps in the region. The harsh memories remain as well.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “What do you notice about the verb tenses in these sentences and in this paragraph overall versus the rest of the article?” (“Remain is in the present tense, talking about something that is still happening.
