Language Dive Guide:  
“The Lost Boys of the Sudan,” Paragraph 4

RI.7.2, L.7.4

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

**Continually under threat,** they would flee for their lives, losing their way in the wilderness.  
(“The Lost Boys of the Sudan,” UNICEF)

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps to address the daily learning target (I can determine central ideas and how they are developed in “The Lost Boys of the Sudan” informational text) and RI.7.2 by inviting students to discuss a central idea from the text.

- Supporting Standards: SL.7.1, L.7.4

- Guiding Question: The sentence helps respond to the guiding question (Who are the Lost Children of Sudan, and what is their story?) by illustrating a common experience that The Lost Boys of the Sudan had to endure.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses the adjective phrase **Continually under threat** with a “would” clause (they would flee for their lives) with the purpose of conveying a past routine. Invite students to discuss each chunk briefly, but encourage extended conversation and practice with the focus structure: **Continually under threat,**

- Practice and Transfer: After discussing the focus structure, students practice using it to discuss something in their own lives. Students transfer their understanding of the meaning and structure of this sentence when determining the habits of character that enabled the Lost Boys to survive, and during the end of unit assessment when writing an objective summary.

- Delivery: The focus structure practice (**Continually \[adjective phrase\] \_\_\_\_\_\_, I would \[verb phrase\] \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**) is presented after the second chunk has been deconstructed to provide additional context and allow for better understanding and discussion.

**Time**

10 minutes

Throughout the Language Dive

Encourage rich conversation among students about the meaning of each of the sentence chunk strips, what the academic phrases within each chunk mean, and how they relate to the sentence and the text overall. Monitor and guide conversation with total participation techniques and Conversation Cues.

After asking questions, provide students up to 1 minute of think time to reflect, depending on the complexity of the question. Alternatively, invite partners to discuss, providing an allocated time for each student.

Record and display student responses next to or underneath the target language for visual reference.

Although students should briefly discuss all chunks in each Language Dive sentence, invite them to slow down during one chunk, called the focus structure, to investigate and practice a particularly compelling language structure.

Where possible, place sketches, pictures, or illustrations above key nouns and verbs in the chunks after discussing their meanings. This allows students to quickly access the content of each chunk as they work with the structures in the sentence as a whole.

For translation work, invite students to use their online or paper translation dictionary if necessary. Invite students to add new vocabulary to their vocabulary logs.

Note: Some responses to questions in the Language Dive indicate only that “Responses will vary.” Like one the larger goals of Language Dives, “Responses will vary” is intended to suggest that students should be encouraged to grapple with questions and ideas, develop interest and participation, and not be immediately steered toward “correct” responses. Indeed, even where correct responses are provided, continue to invite a culture of inquiry and grappling.

Launch

- Welcome students to their first Grade 7 Language Dive. Display the term **Language Dive**.

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partner. Say:

“What do you think a Language Dive is?” (Responses will vary.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- If productive, cue students to clarify the conversation by confirming what they mean. If necessary, prompt students’ responses with sentence frames: “Yes, you’ve got it” or “No, sorry, that’s not what I mean. What I mean is \_\_\_\_\_.” Say:

“So, do you mean \_\_\_\_\_?” (Responses will vary.)

- Confirm or amend and display students’ ideas.

Deconstruct

- Tell students about the first step in the Deconstruct stage:

“When we do a Language Dive, first we read the sentence. We talk about what we think it means and how it might help us understand our guiding question.”

- Invite students to put their finger by this sentence from “The Lost Boys of the Sudan” on their note-catchers: **<u>Continually under threat,</u> they would flee for their lives, losing their way in the wilderness.**

- Read aloud the sentence twice, and then ask students to take turns reading the sentence aloud with their partners.

- Say:

“What does this sentence mean to you?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“How does this sentence add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

Continually under threat,

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Display and read aloud the following sentence chunk strip: **Continually under threat,**

- Underline the adjective phrase under threat in yellow, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 🖉

- Say:

“Does anyone know what the phrase under threat means?” (Threat means there is a possibility something very bad will happen. Under threat is a phrase that means someone or something is in a situation where they are being threatened, where something bad could happen).

“Based on your understanding of the article, who or what was under threat? Why were they under threat?” (The “lost boys” of Sudan were under threat; they were under threat because they were likely to be attacked, to starve to death, to get a disease, to be forced to fight.)

- Invite students to discuss in pairs how they would feel and what they would do if they were *under threat*.

- Remind students that movement and acting out can also help them figure out the meaning of sentences and chunks. Say:

“Can you show me with your face and body how it looks to be under threat?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to open their eyes wide, raise their eyebrows, and tense up their bodies.)

- Point to the word *continually*.

- Say:

“What does the word continually tell us? Is there a familiar word or affix in this word that helps us understand its meaning?” (Continue means “to keep happening” or “to not stop.” The suffix -ly tells us that continually is an adverb and describes the adjective phrase under threat. It tells us someone or something is under threat over and over again; they are frequently in a situation where something bad could happen.)

“What if we replace continually in this chunk with rarely? How does that change the meaning?” (Replacing the word continually with rarely would mean that someone or something is almost never under threat.)

- Say:

“Why do you think the author put this chunk at the beginning of the sentence? What does it tell us about the next part of the sentence?” (The author put this chunk at the beginning of the sentence to emphasize that someone or something was under threat over and over again. We know that the next part of the sentence will tell us about someone or something that was constantly in a situation where something bad could happen.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- Say:

“Let’s talk about the second chunk.”

they would flee for their lives,

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **they would flee for their lives**

- Underline they in blue and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 🖉

- Say:

“Who or what does they refer to in this chunk? How do you know?” (They refers to the “lost boys” of Sudan who set out for refugee camps in Ethiopia; it tells us in the beginning of the paragraph.)

- Underline would flee for their lives in red and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 🖉

- Say:

“What did the ‘lost boys’ do?” (They would flee for their lives. Flee means to run away from danger. For their lives means to save their lives. The boys ran away from danger in order to save their lives.)

“Why did the author use the word would?” (Would is used to express a repeated action in the past. It tells us the ‘lost boys’ fled over and over again in the past.)

“Why would the ‘lost boys’ flee for their lives over and over again?” (They would flee for their lives because they were continually under threat, as expressed in the first chunk.)

- Point out that this chunk alone produces a complete sentence, but the first chunk gives us more information about why the boys would flee. Point out there is still another chunk left and, if time allows, consider asking students to guess what extra information might be added to the end of this sentence.

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Tell students that now they have worked with the first two chunks, they will practice the focus structure to use in their own speaking and writing.

- Display the sentence frame:

> **Continually \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, I would \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

adjective phrase verb phrase

> (**Continually** + adjective phrase + would clause)

- Invite students to use this frame to talk about something they have done many times in the past. Give them time to think and discuss with their partners. Provide an example: “Continually <u>excited about learning</u>, I would <u>check out new books from the library</u>.”

- Say:

“Let’s talk about the third chunk.”

losing their way in the wilderness.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **losing their way in the wilderness.**

- Say:

“What does this chunk tell us?” (Losing their way means getting lost, not knowing where they were going. This chunk gives us more information about what happened to the “lost boys” when they would flee for their lives—they would get lost in the wilderness.)

- Underline in the wilderness in green and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 🖉

- Say:

“Does anyone know the meaning of wilderness? Is there a familiar word or affix in this word that helps us understand its meaning?” (Wild is a familiar adjective that means something is in its natural state, not changed or controlled by people. -ness is a suffix that is added to an adjective to make it a noun—a person, place, thing, or idea. The wilderness is a place that is in its natural state, never having been changed or controlled by people.)

“What kinds of places can you think of that might be called the wilderness?” (Responses might include deserts, big forests, the jungle, etc.)

- Tell students that visualization can help them figure out the meaning of sentences and chunks.

- Say:

“Close your eyes and imagine what it would feel like to lose your way in the wilderness.”

- Invite students to open their eyes and share what they visualized and felt with a partner. (Responses will vary, but may include visualizing being in danger with no one to help them and feeling scared.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

Continually under threat, they would  
flee for their lives, losing their way in the wilderness.

Reconstruct

- Say:

“You did well figuring out what all of the chunks mean, and why they’re important.”

- Tell students they will now go from the Deconstruct to the Reconstruct stage:

“Now that you’ve played with the chunks, let’s put them all back together again into a sentence. And let’s see how playing with the chunks adds to our understanding of the meaning of the sentence and our guiding question. Let’s see how reconstructing helps us understand how English works.”

- Point to and read aloud the entire sentence on display: **<u>Continually under threat,</u> they would flee for their lives, losing their way in the wilderness.**

“How could this sentence be rewritten as two sentences? What would you need to add or change?” (The ‘lost boys’ were continually under threat. Because of this, they would flee for their lives, losing their way in the wilderness.)

“What if we remove the chunk, Continually under threat,? How would this change the meaning of the sentence?” (It would still be a complete sentence, but we would not have information about why the boys would flee for their lives.)

- Remind students that central ideas are the key points the author wants the reader to take away from a text. Invite students to discuss in pairs what this sentence tells us about the central ideas of the text, “The Lost Boys of the Sudan.” (Responses will vary, but may include the following: The Lost Boys of the Sudan had to escape because their lives were in danger over and over again.)

- If productive, cue students to expand the conversation:

“Can you say more about that?” (Responses will vary.)

- Say:

“What other questions can we ask that will help us understand this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses will vary.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

Practice

- Say:

“You did well putting the chunks back together again and talking about how this Language Dive has added to your understanding of the meaning of the sentence and the guiding question.”

- Tell students they will now go from the Reconstruct to the Practice stage:

“You’ve played with the sentence and figured out the meaning, and why it’s important to the guiding question. Now let’s start to use the language in the sentence for our own speaking and writing.”

- Display the sentence frame:

**Continually** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, **the “lost boys” would** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

adjective phrase verb phrase gerund phrase

(adjective phrase + independent clause + gerund phrase)

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use this frame to talk about another central theme in your own words with your partners.”

- If productive, cue students to clarify their sentences by confirming what they mean:

“So, do you mean \_\_\_\_\_?” (Responses will vary. Ensure that students are using the structure meaningfully.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- Congratulate students on completing the Language Dive to better understand the meaning of this sentence, how it connects to the guiding question, and how to use it in their own speaking and writing.

Continually under threat, they would  
flee for their lives, losing their way in the wilderness.
