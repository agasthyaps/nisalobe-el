The setting in chapter 2 is southern Sudan in 2008 and 1985. In both times, the setting is dry and dangerous. Nya has to walk a long way on a dry, dangerous path. The text states that “spiky plants grew along the path” and “their thorns littered the ground everywhere” (8). This shows that Nya has to overcome obstacles in a harsh setting. The setting also shapes the plot in 1985. The war forces Salva to flee his village and become separated from his family. Salva scans the faces of the other people who are fleeing, but “there was no one from his family” (10). This shows that the setting has forced Salva to flee his home and lose his family.
