Point of View Anchor Chart

RL.7.3, RL.7.6

(Example for Teacher Reference)

The **point of view** in narrative texts is the narrator’s position in relation to the story being told. It shows the opinions or feelings of the individuals involved in a situation. Point of view is the way the author allows the reader to “hear” and “see” what is happening.

Point of view focuses on who is telling the story or who is speaking. The ways in which one’s perspective about or attitude toward a subject is revealed depends on how the author develops the speaker’s point of view.

**Author:** the person who wrote the text

**Narrator:** the character or speaker telling the story

**First person point of view:** Comes from the perspective of a character in the story; uses the pronouns **I**, **me**, and **my**; character tells the story as it’s happening, or recalls a story that happened in the past.

**Third person point of view:** Not told by a character in the story; uses the pronouns **he**, **she**, and **they**. Reader might know information that not all characters know.

| Chapter | What is Nya’s point of view of her current situation? What is Salva’s point of view? How do you know?                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | How does Linda Sue Park develop the points of view of Nya and Salva?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | How does Linda Sue Park contrast the points of view of Nya and Salva?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| 2       | **Nya: Wants to be brave despite pain. Developed through narrator describing event in detail, so reader infers and understands the pain. Narrator’s description of her pressing her lips together against pain tells us that she knows she has to be brave about it and carry on.**                                             | **Salva: Wants to be brave and “act like a man” as his father told him to. (11) Developed through narrator describing what Salva is thinking and feeling, and describes his actions as he stepped forward toward the men and said, “Hey!” The narrator describes how Salva strengthened himself by thinking about his family when approached with the gun.**                                            | **N/A**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 3       | **Nya: Relief at the pond both in the seeing life after walking alone, and in the water to drink. Developed for us to infer through Nya’s observations described by narrator. Observations appear positive (“so much life”). (14) Also from description of feeling cooler inside, we infer she felt uncomfortably hot before.** | **Salva: Developed through building suspense when narrator describes how he held his breath and crept closer when he saw the woman. Also naming relief directly (“Salva let out his breath in relief”) once Salva realizes she is Dinka. (16)**                                                                                                                                                         | **Author contrasts by developing a common emotion that both characters are feeling. The points of view are actually more similar than different, but how they are developed is different, which highlights the seriousness (life or death) of Salva’s situation and therefore the intensity of his relief compared to Nya’s.** |
| 4       | **Nya: Feels burdened because she thinks her younger sister is going to slow her down. This is developed through the narrator describing Nya’s thoughts in response to her mother’s request, “Akeer, who was only five years old, was too small and walked too slowly.” (20)**                                                  | **Salva: Feels like a burden because the Dinka people say so. This is developed through the direct speech aimed not at Salva, but which Salva can hear. Many Dinka people speak and say things like, “He is a child. He will slow us down,” and “He is too young to do any real work—he’ll be of no help to us.” (21) It is then shown in Salva’s reaction to the direct speech as he hangs his head.** | **A common theme of this chapter is being a burden. Linda Sue Park contrasts the perspectives of Nya and Salva by showing the two different sides—we see the burdened and the burden. Nya is being burdened with her younger sister, while Salva is seen by the Dinka as a burden.**                                           |
| 5       | **Marial: Confident and he is taking everything in his stride. This is developed through his responses to Salva and the narrator’s description of how he says it (“firmly”). (30)**                                                                                                                                             | **Salva: Worried and upset that he’s going farther and farther from his family. Developed through description of actions and words in response to Marial’s answers (“stopped walking”) and through the description of his thoughts (“I can’t go to another country, Salva thought. If I do, my family will never find me…”). (30)**                                                                     | **By developing two different reactions to a discussion on the same topic. Marial is clearly more confident and calm than Salva and ultimately helps to calm Salva when he understands Salva is upset.**                                                                                                                       |
