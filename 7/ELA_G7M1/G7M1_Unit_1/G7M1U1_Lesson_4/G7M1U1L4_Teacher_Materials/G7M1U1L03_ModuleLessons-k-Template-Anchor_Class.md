Point of View Anchor Chart

RL.7.3, RL.7.6

The **point of view** in narrative texts is the narrator’s position in relation to the story being told. It shows the opinions or feelings of the individuals involved in a situation. Point of view is the way the author allows the reader to “hear” and “see” what is happening.

Point of view focuses on who is telling the story or who is speaking. The ways in which one’s perspective about or attitude toward a subject is revealed depends on how the author develops the speaker’s point of view.

**Author:** the person who wrote the text

**Narrator:** the character or speaker telling the story

**First person point of view:** Comes from the perspective of a character in the story; uses the pronouns **I**, **me**, and **my**; character tells the story as it’s happening, or recalls a story that happened in the past.

**Third person point of view:** Not told by a character in the story; uses the pronouns **he**, **she**, and **they**. Reader might know information that not all characters know.
