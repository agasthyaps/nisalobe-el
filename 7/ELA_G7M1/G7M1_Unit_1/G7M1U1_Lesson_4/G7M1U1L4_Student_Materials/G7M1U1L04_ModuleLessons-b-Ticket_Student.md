**Directions:** As you enter class, answer the following questions.

1.  Read this learning target:

*I can identify strategies to determine the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary.*

**Part A**

Use context to determine the meaning of the word **determine**.

**Part B**

Is this an academic or domain-specific word?

2.  Read the following quote from *A Long Walk to Water*:

“Salva watched as one man protested that he did not want to go with the rebels.”

What is the root of the word **protested**? What does the root mean? What do the affixes mean? What is the origin of each part of the word? Use the affix list at your work space to break the word down into its affixes and root using this chart:

<table style="width:100%;">

<tr class="odd">
