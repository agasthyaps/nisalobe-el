Mid-Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Setting, Plot, and Point of View: *A Long Walk to Water*, Chapter 6

(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Part I**

**Directions:** Reread the passages below from chapter 6 of *A Long Walk to Water*. Then answer the questions below each passage.

1.  “They had no house and had to sleep in **makeshift** shelters.”

Based on word parts and context, what is the meaning of **makeshift**? (RL.7.4, L.7.4, L.7.4a, L.7.4b, L.7.6)

2.  permanent

3.  <u>made to fit a need</u>

4.  comfortable

5.  built to last a while

6.  “*Uncle must know about the war and the fighting! Maybe he will know where my family is!* But his hopes were **dashed** as soon as Uncle spoke.”

What does **dashed** most likely mean in this sentence? (RL.7.4, L.7.4, L.7.4a, L.7.6)

7.  thrown or tossed

8.  <u>ruined or destroyed</u>

9.  done with great speed

10. hit with great force

11. “His face became very **solemn** when Salva told him that he had not seen nor heard a single word of his family in all that time.”

Use a print or online dictionary. Copy the meaning of the word **solemn** as it is used in this sentence. (L.7.4c, L.7.4d, L.7.6)

not cheerful or smiling; serious

12. **Part A**

“At one point, Salva found himself in a line of half a dozen people, all in an **identical** pose—bent over, holding their stomachs, and waiting for the next wave of nausea.”

Complete the chart below to break up the word **identical** into a Latin root and suffix. You may use your affix list as a resource. (L.7.4b)

|        | Affix         | Meaning                                     |
|--------|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Root   | **identitas** | **the same**                                |
| Suffix | **-al**       | **of or pertaining to; having the form of** |

**Part B**

Use what you know about these word parts to write a definition of **identical** in your own words. (RL.7.4, L.7.6)

“Identical” means being the same. (see [Wordsmyth.net](http://wordsmyth.net/))

13. Carefully read these two sentences:

“As he opened his eyes, he heard **wailing**.”

As he opened his eyes, he heard **crying**.

The words in bold have very similar meanings. How does the author’s choice to use the word **wailing** affect our understanding of the first sentence? (RL.7.4, L.7.4, L.7.4c)

14. It implies that the person making the sound is in danger.

15. <u>It emphasizes that the person making the sound is in great pain or grief.</u>

16. It implies that the person making the sound is feeling afraid or confused.

17. It emphasizes that the person making the sound is trying to be quiet.

**Part II**

**Directions:** Use evidence from chapter 6 of *A Long Walk to Water* to complete the chart about Nya’s and Salva’s points of view.

In Chapter 6, the narrator describes how Nya and Salva feel about an adult. We see Nya’s point of view of her mother on page 33, and Salva’s point of view of his uncle on pages 35 and 37. How does Linda Sue Park contrast Nya’s and Salva’s points of view of their family members in this chapter? (RL.7.1, RL.7.3, RL.7.6, RL.7.10)

Tip: How do Nya and Salva see the adult family members differently?

<p><strong>Thinks her mother is afraid about losing the men in her family and she doesn’t like to see the fear.</strong></p></td>

<p><strong>Feels that his uncle is strong and will protect him, but also has fear about losing his uncle.</strong></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>How has the author developed this point of view? What evidence from the text supports your answer above?</p>
<p><strong>The narrator tells us directly that Nya sees fear on her mother’s face and the language the narrator uses (“But the worst…”) on page 33 tells us that Nya doesn’t like to see that fear, and through this we can infer that perhaps she is worried for her mother and sees her as vulnerable.</strong></p></td>
<td><p>How has the author developed this point of view? What evidence from the text supports your answer above?</p>
<p><strong>When Uncle first joins them (35) it describes how the group saw him as a leader, and it also says (37), “Salva always tried to keep Uncle in sight. And he slept near Uncle at night” (37).</strong></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td colspan="2"><p>How does Linda Sue Park contrast Nya’s and Salva’s points of view?</p>
<p><strong>Nya and Salva have contrasting points of view on the adults described in the chapter. We infer that Nya is worried for her mother and sees her as vulnerable, while Salva sees his uncle as a protector. We understand these contrasting points of view through the narrator’s descriptions of what Salva and Nya are thinking and feeling.</strong></p></td>
