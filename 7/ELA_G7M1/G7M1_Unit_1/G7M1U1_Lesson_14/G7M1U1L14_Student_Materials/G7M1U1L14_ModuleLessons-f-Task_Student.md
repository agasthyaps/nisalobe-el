Quote Accurately from the Text

RL.7.1, RI.7.1

**Name:** **Date:**

Sometimes in writing, you will need to include a direct quote from a text.

When quoting from a text:

- Copy the exact words that are in the text.

- Give the page number that the quote is from.

- If the page number is not in the sentence, then put it after the quote in parentheses: “Quote” (75).

- If you quote more than one author, use the authors’ names in parentheses with the page number: “Quote” (Park 75).

- Use quotation marks (“quote”) to show the words that have come word for word from the text.

- If using “he said,” “she said,” or “it says,” for example, put a comma before the quotation marks. (On page 30 Miguel said, “Quote.”)
