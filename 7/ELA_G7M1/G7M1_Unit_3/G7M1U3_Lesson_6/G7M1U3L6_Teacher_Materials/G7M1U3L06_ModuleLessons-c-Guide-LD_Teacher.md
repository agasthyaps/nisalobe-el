(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

Now she can see **blue sky beyond those dark clouds.** (from page 22 of *Nasreen’s Secret School* by Jeanette Winter)

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the Daily Learning Target (I can determine the meaning and impact of figurative language.), RL.7.4 and L.7.5 by providing an example of figurative language to describe a feeling of hope. The sentence also helps students to address W.7.3e by providing an example of an effective conclusion that reflects on the narrated experiences and events in the story.

- Guiding Question: The sentence helps students respond to the guiding question (What are the habits of character the Lost Children used to survive?) by sharing a reflection of a character who demonstrates perseverance amidst hardship, similar to the Lost Children of Sudan.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses figurative language for the purpose of providing an example of an effective narrative conclusion. Invite students to discuss each chunk briefly, but encourage extended conversation and practice with the focus structure: **blue sky beyond those dark clouds.**

- Practice and Transfer: After discussing the focus structure, students practice using it to discuss something in their lives. Students transfer their understanding of the meaning and structure of this sentence when planning for their narratives in this lesson, and when writing a reflection and ending for their narrative during the End of Unit 3 Assessment.

Now she can see

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following sentence chunk strip: **Now she can see**

- Say:

“Who does she refer to in this chunk?” (Nasreen; we know because the previous page was about Nasreen.)

“What can Nasreen see?” (We aren’t sure yet; it will tell us in the next chunk)

- Underline Now in green, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 🖉

- Say:

“Can you figure out why the author uses the word now?” (Now means at this time, or in this moment. It tells us that Nasreen can see something in this moment that she couldn’t see before.)

- Invite students to revisit the words and pictures on pages 14–21 of *Nasreen’s Secret School*.

- Say:

“What changed in Nasreen’s life?” (She started going to school).

“What do you think Nasreen can see that she couldn’t see before?” (Responses will vary, but may include that Nasreen can now see hope in her future.)

blue sky beyond those dark clouds.

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **blue sky beyond those dark clouds.**

- Say:

“What does this chunk tell us?” (This chunk tells us what Nasreen can see; she can see blue sky beyond those dark clouds.)

- Underline blue sky and those dark clouds. in blue, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 🖉

- Then, display the picture on page 22.

- Say:

“Does the author mean that Nasreen can literally see blue sky and dark clouds?” (No, the author is using figurative language to help us imagine the way Nasreen is feeling. The blue sky represents the hope Nasreen feels from learning in school and those dark clouds represent the hardships in her life, including losing her mother and father.)

“What in the picture helps us understand that the author is using figurative language?” (The image of Nasreen’s parents holding hands among the blue sky helps us understand that the blue sky is figurative language, representing hope.)

- If productive, cue students to expand the conversation by elaborating on their response:

“Can you say more about that?” (Responses will vary.)

- Invite students to discuss in pairs where the **blue sky** and **dark clouds** are in the picture. (Responses will vary, but may include: The **blue sky** is behind the **dark clouds**. The **dark clouds** are in front of the **blue sky**.)

- Underline beyond in green, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 🖉

- Say:

“Can you figure out why the author uses the word beyond?” (Beyond means in the distance, on the further side of something. In the picture the blue sky is beyond, or in the distance past those dark clouds, telling us the dark clouds are still there, but there is blue sky just past them.)

“How can we say this chunk in a more literal way?” (Responses will vary but may include a sense of hope, even though the hardships haven’t gone away.)

- Invite students to take 30 seconds in pairs to share other examples figurative language expressing hope amongst hardship. (Responses will vary, but may include **the light at the end of the tunnel**, **a rainbow in somebody’s cloud**.) Encourage students to share expressions of figurative language in their home language.

- Then, invite students to sketch the figurative meaning of this chunk: **blue sky beyond those dark clouds** on their note-catcher. 🖉

- Then, invite them to sketch the literal meaning next to it (hope among hardship) to demonstrate their understanding of the difference between figurative and literal language.

- After inviting responses, write and display student ideas.

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Display the sentence frame:

> **Now I can see \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ beyond \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**
>
> (**Now** + **I can see** + figurative noun phrase + **beyond** + figurative noun phrase.)

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use this frame to talk about something you feel hopeful about, even amidst hardship. Use figurative language in your own words with your partners.”

Now she can see <u>blue sky beyond those dark clouds.</u>

Reconstruct

- Point to and read aloud the entire sentence on display: **Now she can see <u>blue sky beyond those dark clouds</u>.**

“What if we replace beyond in this chunk with the phrase instead of? How would that change the meaning of the sentence?” (Replacing beyond with instead of would tell us that Nasreen no longer saw those dark clouds, that her hardships had gone away. Rather than seeing hope even though she still has hardships, the phrase instead of would imply that Nasreen’s hope has replaced all of her hardships.)

- If productive, cue students to expand the conversation by elaborating on their response:

“Can you say more about that?” (Responses will vary.)

- After inviting responses, write and display student ideas.

- Invite students to briefly discuss in pairs how this sentence serves as the reflection and ending of the book, *Nasreen’s Secret School*. (Responses will vary, but may include the following: this sentence serves as both the reflection and ending because although much of the book portrays the many hardships Nasreen has suffered throughout her life, her ability to go to school gives her hope for the future.)

- If time allows, consider reinforcing students’ understanding of figurative language by displaying the sentence on page 18: **Windows opened for Nasreen in that little schoolroom.** Invite students to discuss in pairs how the figurative language on page 18 is similar to the figurative language on page 22. (Responses will vary, but may include that the phrase **windows opened for Nasreen** represents hope just like the phrase **blue sky**.)

- Say:

“What other questions can we ask that will help us understand this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses will vary.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

> **Salva saw \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ beyond \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**
>
> (independent clause + beyond + noun phrase)

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Now that we have looked at an effective narrative conclusion sentence from Nasreen’s Secret School, let’s try to write our own concluding sentences. Use the sentence frame to make up your own concluding sentence about Salva’s story in A Long Walk to Water. Make sure your concluding sentence connects to what happened to Salva in the story, reflecting on both his hardship and his hope.”

“Use this frame to reflect on Salva’s story in your own words with your partner.”
