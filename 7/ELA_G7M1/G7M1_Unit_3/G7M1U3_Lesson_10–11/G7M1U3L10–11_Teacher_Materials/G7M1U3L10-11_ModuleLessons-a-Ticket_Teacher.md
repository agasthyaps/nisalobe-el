Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lessons 10–11

(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Answer the following questions.

Now that you are ready to convert your narratives into ebooks, think about some of the different ways you’ve read text (books, phones, computers, magazines). How do those ways of reading affect your experience? What do you think will be most interesting or useful about an ebook?

Responses will vary. Possible response: Reading on my phone is good for quick, short text. I don’t like reading books or articles on my phone because I can’t see the text and pictures at the same time and I have to scroll a lot. Reading magazines and books on a computer or digital reader is good unless I want to relax on the couch or at the beach, then I like the print version. The ebook will be cool because any kid can read it online, but working with a new digital platform may be hard for me.
