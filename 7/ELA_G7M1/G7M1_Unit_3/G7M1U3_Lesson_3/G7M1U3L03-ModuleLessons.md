Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Repeated routines occur in the following:

- RL.7.7 – Opening A and B: In the entrance ticket activity, students analyze the techniques authors use to show readers how to read texts.

- Opening B: Students review the learning target.

- Closing and Assessment A: Students use the Think-Pair-Share protocol to engage in a collaborative discussion about academic mindsets.

- New skills are introduced in the following:

- Work Time A: Students complete the mid-unit assessment, in which they compare an excerpt from the audio version of *A Long Walk to Water* with an excerpt of the text from chapter 1, comparing the effects of the techniques in the versions (RL.7.1, RL.7.7)

- Students focus on working to become effective learners and ethical people by reading and answering questions independently with perseverance and integrity for the mid-unit assessment.

- The Think-Write-Pair-Share protocol is used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Students who finish early can engage in further reflection on the relationship between written text and text that is read aloud. Encourage those students to write variations on sentences or paragraphs from the book to suggest different ways that the sentences can be read.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the first half of this unit, students began comparing and contrasting audio and text versions of *A Long Walk to Water*. This lesson continues those routines in an assessment.

Support All Students

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment.

- At this point, students should be reading the text independently. However, if some or all students need more support, read several pages aloud and then release students to read independently, in pairs, or in small groups. ▲

- Some students may need the text read aloud before they work on the questions. Invite students who require this to sit in a group away from the rest of the students, so as not to be distracting.

- The subject matter in this chapter includes descriptions of war and displacement. Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this lesson that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually.

- For some students, this assessment may require more than the 30 minutes allotted. Provide time over multiple days if necessary.

- To support ELLs, this lesson challenges students to extend their understanding of spoken English and its relation to written English with a mid-unit assessment that entails comparing and contrasting audio and written text.

- ELLs may find coordinating the dual processes of listening to and writing in a new language challenging when completing the mid-unit assessment. Therefore, additional supports such as the ones below, which present strategies for “getting unstuck” and persevering, may be useful.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.B.6 and 7.I.B.7.

Assessment Guidance

- All assessment materials (student prompt and teacher checklist) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback on this assessment, use the answer key and sample student responses (see Assessment Overview and Resources) to help complete students’ Track Progress recording form.

- In this assessment, students are tracking progress toward anchor standard:

- R.1: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue reading *A Long Walk to Water*, building on the reading and analysis they have done in this and the previous lessons. Students will also examine a children’s picture book narrative as a model for the narratives they will write for their end of unit assessment.

- Students’ mid-unit assessments will be returned in a future lesson with feedback.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Return End of Unit Assessments with Feedback (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 3**. Students will review their responses in Opening B.

- Return students’ **end of unit assessments** with feedback, and allow students time to review feedback and write their name on the board if they require support.

Opening

B. Engage the Learner – RL.7.7 (5 minutes)

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique to review their responses.

- Repeated routine: follow the same routine as in previous lessons to review the learning target and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any similarities between this learning target and those from previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Mid-Unit 3 Assessment: Compare Audio to Text (30 minutes)

- Review the learning target:

“I can compare and contrast a written story to the audio version of the story and analyze the effect of the techniques.”

- Distribute **Mid-Unit 3 Assessment: Compare Audio to Text: *A Long Walk to Water***, **Chapter 1**, and invite students to take out their copies of ***A Long Walk to Water***.

- Read the directions for the assessment aloud as students follow along silently. Answer clarifying questions.

- Tell students that for this assessment, they will listen to a new excerpt of the audio version of *A Long Walk to Water*, from a part of the book they’ve already read and compare it to the text version of the book. Remind students of their work comparing the audio and text versions of A Long Walk to Water in the previous two lessons. Ask student volunteers to refer to their notes from the activity when they entered class and share key strategies for comparing the audio and text versions of the novel. ▲ Also, students may consult the **Strategies to Answer Selected Response Questions anchor chart** to guide them in answering the assessment questions. ▲

- Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners** and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor charts**. Remind students that because they will be reading and answering questions independently for the assessment, they will need to practice perseverance and integrity.

- Invite students to reflect on academic mindsets before beginning the assessment:

“What value does comparing an audio to a text have for you? What does this mean to you beyond the work you are doing in the classroom? What will help you to feel you can succeed at this?” (Responses will vary. Possible response: In life, we spend a lot of time listening. We learn by listening. It’s important to see how authors captivate readers through audio, as well as through the written text. I can succeed at this by working really hard and trying my best.)

- Invite students to preview the questions on the mid-unit assessment before playing the **Audiobook version of *A Long Walk to Water*** **(05:17–7:40)** on the **device** for the first time. Inform students that they will now listen to the clip on which they will be assessed. Instruct students that they will have a chance to take preliminary notes after listening and to preview the questions before their next listen. Tell students that they will listen to the clip again so that they can complete this portion of their mid-unit assessment. Explain to students that they will listen to the clip four times in all. Allow time for students to review the questions before playing the clip each time.

- Invite students to begin the assessment.

- While they are taking the assessment, circulate to monitor and document their test-taking skills.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time A, when introducing the assessment, have students share what they do to get unstuck and keep going when they do not understand words or sentences on an assessment or are having trouble knowing what to write. This sharing of strategies for getting unstuck helps ELLs in two ways. First, it builds efficacy and language skills by allowing students to verbally help their peers. Second, it provides useful strategies and encouragement for those who may struggle with the language of the assessment.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time A, when introducing the assessment, model methods to help keep going if stuck on an item in the assessment. Talk about strategies to understand unfamiliar language in the text or the audio or ways to think of words to write. Modeling getting unstuck helps ELLs to persist and keep going if they are having difficulty accessing or producing language in English.

Closing and Assessment

A. Review Learning Target (5 minutes)

- Give students specific positive feedback on their completion of the mid-unit assessment (e.g., “I noticed a lot of you were taking good notes on the differences between the audio and text versions of the book”).

- Focus students on the Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart. Remind students that they will take responsibility for their own learning as they assess their progress toward the learning target.

- Review the learning target:

“I can compare and contrast a written story to the audio version of the story and analyze the effect of the techniques.”

- Ask students to Think-Write-Pair-Share about how well they progressed toward the learning target and areas in which they still need to grow. Discuss as a class plans or strategies for growing in this learning target.

- Incorporate reflection on and awareness of the following academic mindsets: “I can succeed at this” and “My ability and competence grow with my effort.”

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What helped you be successful with the mid-unit assessment?” (Sample response: I worked really hard, I took my time, and I put in my best effort.)

For Lighter Support

- When providing students with positive feedback about their work on the mid-unit assessment, be as specific as possible with ELLs about instances where they attempted to expand their written language skills, even if the attempt was not wholly successful (i.e., resulted in sentence fragments, jumbled syntax, or incorrect spelling and grammar). Encouraging students to try out new language structures without undue fear of critique or failure is crucial to fostering the growth of ELLs’ skills in English, and any attempts at reaching beyond previous levels of English acquisition should be.

For Heavier Support

- When providing students with positive feedback about their work on the mid-unit assessment, recognize attempts beginning English speakers made to expand their written language skills by explaining how the attempt made will help them continue to improve their writing. For instance, if a student has moved from writing isolated sentences to paragraphs, one might point out the progress they have made in extending their writing.

Homework

A. Preread Anchor Text

- Students should preread chapter 18 of *A Long Walk to Water* in preparation for studying the chapter in the next lesson.
