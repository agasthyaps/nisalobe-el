**Name:** **Date:**

**Directions:** As you enter class, answer the following prompts.

1.  Read this learning target, and rewrite the learning target using your own words in place of the words **version**, **audio**, **techniques**, and **effect**:

- I can compare and contrast a written story to the audio version of the story and analyze the effect of the techniques.

2.  Write a learning target for yourself for today using a character trait.

3.  Return to chapter 9 of *A Long Walk to Water*, and select a paragraph or sentence that you would like to read aloud for the class. Mark it with a sticky note. Think about how you will read the paragraph or sentence to emphasize emotion and action in the text. Only volunteers will read. If you would rather not read in front of the class, select a paragraph or sentence and think about how it would be read aloud. What can a reader add to the written text?
