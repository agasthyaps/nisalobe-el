(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

**When at last** she was able to speak, it was only in a whisper. (from page 103 of *A Long Walk to Water* by Linda Sue Park)

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the Daily Learning Target (I can compare and contrast a written story to the audio version of the story and analyze the effect of the techniques.) and RL.7.7 by inviting them to discuss how techniques readers use, such as changes in voice, can portray emotional states in a way that is different from the print version.

- Big Idea: The sentence helps students respond to the big idea (In Sudan there are water scarcity issues, which means many people do not have easy access to clean water. As a result, most girls and women persevere to walk all day to get water.) by portraying Nya’s amazement in having the opportunity to attend school after a lifetime of walking all day to get water.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses the conjunction **when** with the purpose of connecting the first chunk to the last chunk of this sentence, signaling that we will find out about something that happened at a particular time. Invite students to discuss each chunk briefly, but encourage extended conversation and practice with the focus structure: **when at last**.

- Practice and Transfer: After discussing the focus structure, students practice using it to discuss something in their lives. Students transfer their understanding of the meaning and structure of this sentence when comparing written and audio text during the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment, and when developing characters in a narrative during the End of Unit 3 Assessment.

- Delivery: The focus structure practice (**When at last I \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, I \_\_\_\_\_\_.**) is presented after all of the chunks are deconstructed to provide additional context and allow for better understanding and discussion.

**Key**

Green

Deconstruct

- Invite students to put their finger by this sentence from *A Long Walk to Water* on their note-catchers: **<u>When at last</u> she was able to speak, it was only in a whisper.**

- Read aloud the sentence twice, and then ask students to take turns reading the sentence aloud with their partners.

- Say:

“What does this sentence mean to you?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“How does this sentence add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

When at last

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **When at last**

- Underline When in green, and invite students to do the same on their Language Dive: *A Long Walk to Water*, Page 103 note-catcher. 🖉

- Say:

“What does the word when tell us?” (When is used to tell us about time. In this sentence, when is used to mean at or during the time that something happens; it is used as a conjunction to connect this part of the sentence with the next part of the sentence and signal that we will find out about something that happened at a particular time.)

“Can you figure out why Park wrote at last?” (Park wrote at last to point out that it took a long time to lead up to something.)

- Invite students to take 30 seconds in pairs to list synonyms for **at last** (**finally**, **ultimately**).

- Say:

“What is another way to say this chunk?” (finally, at the time)

she was able to speak,

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **she was able to speak,**

- Say:

“Who does she refer to in this chunk?” (Nya; we know because the previous two sentences were about Nya.)

“What does this chunk tell us about Nya?” (She was able to speak; that Nya could speak or talk.)

- Place the first chunk next to this chunk and invite students to read aloud the two chunks together: **When at last she was able to speak,**

- Say:

“What do these two chunks tell us when we place them together?” (Responses will vary, but may include the following: Together, the first two chunks tell us that Nya could finally speak, meaning that she was unable to speak before. The conjunction when tells us that, in the next chunk, we will find out about something that happened at the time Nya could finally speak.)

“Think about what just happened in the story.” Reread previous sentences if necessary.  
“Why was Nya previously unable to speak?” (Responses will vary, but should include she was surprised and amazed that a school was being built, which she would be able to attend.  
This was a dream come true for Nya, and something that was unheard of before, especially for girls.)

- Invite students to discuss in pairs a time when they were unable to speak because they were so surprised or happy about something.

it was only in a whisper.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **it was only in a whisper.**

- Say:

“What does it refer to?” (It refers to Nya’s voice—we know from context in the first chunk. It could be replaced with Nya’s voice without changing the meaning.)

“What does this chunk tell us about Nya’s voice?” (Nya’s voice was in a whisper. In a whisper means to speak or say something very quietly, with your breath rather than your voice.)

“Why does the author include the word only?” (Only means no more than, merely. The author includes the word only to emphasize how soft Nya’s voice was; it was no more than a whisper.)

- Invite students to read this chunk aloud: **only in a whisper.**

- Say:

“How does reading this chunk in a whisper help us understand Nya’s emotional state?” (Responses will vary, but may include the following: reading this chunk in a whisper helps us understand that Nya was so amazed about the opportunity to go to school that she could hardly speak.)

- Invite students to listen to the audio recording of this paragraph once again, and to discuss the effect of the whispered dialogue that follows this sentence: “*All* the children, Papa? The girls, too?” Invite students to discuss how the change in the reader’s voice in the audio version helps convey Nya’s emotional state in a way that is different than the print version.

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Display the sentence frame:

> **When at last I \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, I couldn’t stop smiling.**
>
> (**When at last** + **I** + predicate + independent clause) (e.g., When at last I <u>learned how to ride a bike</u>, I couldn’t stop smiling.)

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use this frame to talk about something you were finally able to do that made you smile in your own words with your partners.”

When at last she was able to speak, it was only in a whisper.

Reconstruct

- Point to and read aloud the entire sentence on display: **<u>When at last</u> she was able to speak, it was only in a whisper.**

“Can you say this sentence in a different order? How?” (Yes; you could rearrange to chunks to be “It was only in a whisper, when at last she was able to speak.”)

- Invite three students to each hold a chunk and switch places to show the sentence in a different, correct order: **It was only in a whisper, when at last she was able to speak.**

“What is another way to say this sentence?” (Responses will vary, but may include the following: at the time Nya was finally able to speak, her voice was merely a whisper.)

- Remind students of one of the big ideas in this module: In Sudan there are water scarcity issues, which means many people do not have easy access to clean water. As a result, most girls and women persevere to walk all day to get water. Invite students to close their eyes and imagine they are Nya, walking every day to get water. Then, invite them to imagine someone coming to tell them they never had to walk to get water again, and could start going to school to learn.

- Invite students to open their eyes and discuss in pairs why they might be unable to speak in this situation. (Responses will vary, but may include feeling so amazed that they became speechless or feeling so in shock that they wouldn’t know what to say.)

- After inviting responses, write and display student ideas.

- Say:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses will vary.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

> **When at last Nya went to school, she \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**
>
> (When + at last + subject + predicate + independent clause.)

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use this frame to talk about how you think Nya felt when she finally went to school in your own words with your partners.”
