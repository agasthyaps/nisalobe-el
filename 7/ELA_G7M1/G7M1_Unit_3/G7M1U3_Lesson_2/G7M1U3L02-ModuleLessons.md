Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Repeated routines occur in the following:

- RL.7.7 – Opening A: In the entrance ticket activity, students look at a paragraph from *A Long Walk to Water* and note ways they would read it to add emphasis.

- Opening A: Students review the learning target.

- Work Time A: Students read the next chapter of the text, finding the gist, and adding to the Questions about *A Long Walk to Water* anchor chart.

- RL.7.4 – Closing and Assessment A: Students analyze the structure and meaning of a sentence from chapter 17 of *A Long Walk to Water* in a Language Dive to support analyzing the effects of connotative language and the description of characters’ facial gestures to convey emotion and meaning, so students can use these techniques in their own narrative writing. ▲

- New skills are introduced in the following:

- RL.7.7 – Work Time B: Students listen to an audiobook excerpt from the chapter and complete a note-catcher to support analysis of how the techniques in the audiobook create certain effects.

- The Think-Pair-Share and Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocols are used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- In chapter 17 of *A Long Walk to Water*, read during this lesson, Nya’s father demonstrates compassion for the children by building them a school. Salva demonstrates perseverance as he turns his idea into a reality, respect for his father, and responsibility as he speaks to audiences.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- In addition to analyzing the audiobook in this lesson, students will have an opportunity to reflect on how their analysis will support them in the writing of their narratives for the end of unit and performance tasks at the end of the module. Therefore, encourage those students who are proficient at analyzing the audio to begin considering ways to apply their learning to their own narratives. This may take the form of analyzing parts of the text that the note-catcher didn’t cover or asking students to experiment by writing their own sentences or paragraphs and finding opportunities to show emphasis.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students extended their understanding of the novel *A Long Walk to Water* to include an analysis of the audio version. This lesson gives students the opportunity to continue to engage with the text through the audio version and, in the process, consider elements of the storytelling from a fresh perspective.

Support All Students

- Students may need additional support engaging with the comparison of audio to text. Create deliberate partnerships where one student can assume a mentoring role with the other. For those students with difficulty discerning tones of voice and their emotional context, focus on the objective qualities of the voice, such as volume or accent, to help them make the connection between changes in voice and emotional states. ▲

- At this point, students should be reading the text independently. However, if some or all students need more support, read several pages aloud and then release students to read independently, in pairs, or in small groups.

- The subject matter in this chapter includes girls just gaining access to education, serious family illness, and water insecurity issues. Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this lesson that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually.

- Note there is a differentiated version of Compare Audio to Text: *A Long Walk to Water*, Chapter 17 note-catcher used in Work Time B in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson extends the opportunities to compare and contrast written and audio text begun in the previous lesson, providing the chance for ELLs to further hone their capacity to understand spoken English and recognize its relationship to written English.

- ELLs may find comparing and contrasting the audiobook and the novel challenging because of the demands of juggling the relationship between audio and text in a new language. Therefore, additional supports such as the ones listed below, which were also used in Lesson 1, may be useful.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standard 7.I.B.6.

Assessment Guidance

- In addition to asking student pairs to share out as they complete the note-catcher, move about the room to monitor discussion between partners to ensure comprehension and correct misunderstanding.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will compare the text *A Long Walk to Water* to the audio version in their mid-unit assessments, drawing on the comparison practice in this and the previous lesson.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RL.7.7 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 2**. Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique to review their responses. Invite a few volunteers to read aloud their chosen paragraph to the class.

- Repeated routine: follow the same routine as in previous lessons to review the learning target and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any similarities between this learning target and those from previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read *A Long Walk to Water*, Chapter 17 – SL.7.1 (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: follow the same process as previous lessons for students to read chapter 17 of ***A Long Walk to Water***, using the **Text Guide: *A Long Walk to Water*** as necessary. If students do not finish reading the chapter within the allotted time, use the **Synopsis: *A Long Walk to Water***, **Chapter 17** document to review the key details from chapter 17. Then have students identify the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary, reflect on their reading as they choose, and record the gist on **sticky notes** using the following resources as appropriate: **vocabulary logs**, **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**, and **Questions about *A Long Walk to Water*** **anchor chart**.

- Gists:

- **Nya:** making a school for boys AND girls

- **Salva:** visits with dad, has idea to help Sudan, asks many people for help

- Once students have finished reading and reflecting on the chapter, ask them to go Back-to-Back, Face-to-Face:

“Which habits of character did you see in this chapter? Who demonstrated them? What did they look or sound like?” (Responses will vary. Possible response: Nya’s father demonstrates compassion for the children by building them a school. Salva demonstrates perseverance as he turns his idea into a reality, respect for his father as he comforts him, and responsibility as he speaks to audiences.)

Work Time

B. Compare Audio to Text – RL.7.7 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target:

“I can compare and contrast a written story to the audio version of the story and analyze the effect of the techniques.”

- Inform students that they will now listen to an audio version of a section of chapter 17 from *A Long Walk to Water*, which they just read. Tell students that they will be comparing the text and the audio to look for ways that the audio adds to the text or is different from it.

- Distribute the **Compare Audio to Text: *A Long Walk to Water*** **Chapter 17 note-catcher** and **Compare Audio to Text: *A Long Walk to Water*** **Chapter 17 note-catcher** ▲ as necessary for students who need extra support. The differentiated note-catcher supports students’ analysis with sentence starters. ▲

- Tell students that they will now listen to an excerpt of the audiobook from pages 103–104. Place students in pairs for listening to the audio and answering the questions on the note-catcher. Ask students to only listen to this first reading, paying attention to what they notice about the reader’s voice or technique. Invite students to write down what they notice in the first section of the note-catcher, under “First Listen.” Play the **Audiobook version of** ***A Long Walk to Water*** **(2:15:30–2:17:04)** on the **device**. Consult **Compare Audio to Text: *A Long Walk to Water***, **Chapter 17 note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Ask students to share out some of what they noticed. (Responses will vary but may include: There is music at the beginning of the chapter. The speaker is a female. She uses different accents and ways of changing her voice to show emotion or what is happening.)

- Now inform students that they will listen to the audio again, and this time, they should focus on the first two questions on the note-catcher. Invite students to reread these silently before starting the audio. Replay the audio, and invite students to answer the first two questions with their partners. Ask for volunteers to share their responses, and correct any misunderstandings before moving forward.

- Inform students that they will listen to the audio one more time to answer the remaining questions on the note-catcher with their partners. Inform or remind students about what *mood* means when discussing texts: the feelings or emotions that a passage conveys. Place *mood* on the **domain-specific word wall**, allowing time for students to record it in their vocabulary logs. Explain that the tone of voice for a speaker can also develop a mood or emotion. Tell students that for the reflection question, there is no “right” answer, but students should think about how the audio affected their understanding of the text. Direct students’ attention to the graphic organizer. Ask students to Turn and Talk:

“What are you going to record in this first column? How does that information connect to the information in the next few columns?” (Possible response: All of the columns relate to the same kind of effect, so the effect must show up in the text and in the audio, and have an example that is about both the text and the audio. Each item in each row relates to the next.)

- Once students have completed the Compare Audio to Text: *A Long Walk to Water*, Chapter 17 note-catcher, invite them to share their responses to the “Reflection” section. Remind students that they will be writing a narrative for elementary school students that is meant to be read aloud. Ask for volunteers to share their thoughts about how written books and audiobooks are both similar and different. (Responses will vary but may include: The words in both the audio and text versions are the same. An author can describe how things are said, but a reader can actually say them. In text versions, the reader imagines the voices of the characters, but in the audio version the reader chooses how they sound.)

- Invite students to Think-Pair-Share about the following question:

“What have you learned so far from comparing the text and audio versions of *A Long Walk to Water* that will help you write your own texts that are meant to be read aloud?” (We’ve learned about how readers say words that are in italics or followed by exclamation points differently from other words. We’ve also learned that readers say dialogue in different ways to make the story clearer.)

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the learning target.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time B, as in the previous lesson, preview the audio recording by pointing out particular sections students should pay attention to that add to the text or are different from it. Letting students know which sections of the recording to pay close attention to in advance makes the task of following the recording more accessible for ELLs and others.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time B, as in the previous lesson, let students control how many times they listen to, pause, stop, start, and replay the audio recording if they are using individual laptops and headphones. This repeated listening strategy supports ELLs by allowing them to improve their comprehension by repeating language they may not understand and thinking it through again.

Closing and Assessment

A. Language Dive: *A Long Walk to Water*, Page 103 – RL.7.4 (10 minutes)

- Repeated routine: follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to facilitate a Language Dive with the following sentence:

“When at last she was able to speak, it was only in a whisper.”

- Use the accompanying materials to facilitate the Language Dive:

- **Language Dive Guide: *A Long Walk to Water***, **Page 103 (for teacher reference)**

- **Language Dive: *A Long Walk to Water***, **Page 103 sentence chunk strips**

- **Language Dive: *A Long Walk to Water***, **Page 103 note-catcher**

- **Language Dive: *A Long Walk to Water***, **Page 103 note-catcher (for teacher reference)**

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- Before inviting students to share their responses to the “reflection” section of the note-catcher, encourage them first to share their reflections with an elbow partner sitting close to them, enabling ELLs to practice their responses in a more supportive context before sharing them with the whole class. Such pre-sharing with partners prior to whole-class sharing builds ELLs’ speaking confidence, making them more willing to speak up in whole-class settings because they have already had a chance to rehearse what they wish to say.

For Heavier Support

- When doing the partner share recommended in Lighter Support, provide students with sentence stems for responding to their partner, based on the following Goal 1 Conversation Cues:

- Can you say more about that?

- Can you give an example?

- Using these Conversation Cues with their partners helps ELLs in two ways. It provides ELLs with the language they need to keep a conversation going with a partner and also fosters the development of their oral language skills by allowing them to elaborate on and extend their initial comments.

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their independent reading journal.
