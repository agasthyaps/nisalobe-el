Write to Raise Awareness: The Lost Children of South Sudan

Teaching Notes for Unit 3

Prioritize Lessons for Classrooms with Many ELLs

To prepare for the Unit 3 assessments, prioritize and expand instruction in Lessons 4–7, which introduce how to write a picture book narrative. Depending on students’ needs, expand work on developing plot, setting, and character through doing more work with the Narrative Writing Plan graphic organizer and providing lists of relevant words related to character, setting, and plot that students can use to help them fill out their graphic organizers and write their narratives. Such lists might include words used to describe a character’s appearance and attributes, words used to depict the setting in Africa, and/or words used to move a plot along.

Language Dives

In Lesson 2, students do a Language Dive in which they learn how to interpret and use connotative language and facial expressions to depict a character’s emotions (**RL.7.4**). In a subsequent Language Dive, in Lesson 6, students do a Language Dive that explores the ways in which figurative language can be used to craft an effective conclusion to a story (**W.7.3e**). During a Language Dive, slow down for 10–20 minutes to examine the meaning, purpose, and structure of a compelling sentence from a complex text, model, learning target, checklist, or rubric included in the curriculum. This process invites students to unpack complex syntax, or “academic phrases,” as a way to build both literacy and habits of mind. Students then apply their understanding of language structure as they work toward the assessments and performance task. Through the Language Dive’s engaging Deconstruct-Reconstruct-Practice routine, students play with “chunks” of the sentence, interpreting them, rearranging them, and using them to talk about their own lives or lesson content. As a result of paying close attention to how language works, all students begin to acquire the necessary facility with academic English, and ELLs foster their overall language ability. A consistent Language Dive routine is critical in helping all students learn how to decipher complex sentences and write their own.

Diversity and Inclusion

Investigate the routines, practices, rituals, beliefs, norms, and experiences that are important to ELLs and their families. Integrate this background into the classroom as students explore the novel and informational text in the unit. An ideal context for inclusiveness emerges as students are invited to share their thoughts about chapters of *A Long Walk to Water*. Be sensitive to the fact that some ELLs and immigrant students may have firsthand experience of traumatic migration and immigration that mirrors those of the Sudanese characters in *A Long Walk to Water*. Foster inclusive action by creating space for students to express their feelings about sensitive issues embedded in the novel, knowing that these discussions may help create equity or unearth trauma or both. Consult with a guidance counselor, school social worker, or ESL teacher before discussing students’ experiences and for further investigation of diversity and inclusion.

Conversation Cues

Encourage productive and equitable conversation with Conversation Cues, which are questions to ask students that help achieve four goals:

- (Goal 1) encourage all students to talk and be understood;

- (Goal 2) listen carefully to one another and seek to understand;

- (Goal 3) deepen thinking; and

- (Goal 4) think with others to expand the conversation (adapted from Michaels, Sarah and O’Connor, Cathy. *Talk Science Primer*. TERC, 2012. http://inquiryproject.terc.edu/shared/pd/TalkScience_Primer.pdf. Based on Chapin, Suzanne, et al. *Classroom Discussions: Using Math Talk to Help Students Learn, Grades K–6*. 2nd ed. Math Solutions Publications, 2009).

Refer to the Tools Page (http://eled.org/tools) for the complete set of cues. Goal 1 Conversation Cues are introduced in Unit 1, Lesson 1. For ELLs, Conversation Cues are especially critical because they improve language processing abilities and increase engagement and participation.

Compare and Contrast Written Text with an Audio Rendition

Over a series of three lessons, students learn how to compare and contrast a written text with an audio rendition of the same text. This work with the relation between a written text and its audio rendition is valuable to ELLs because it challenges them to stretch their capacity for understanding the relationship between spoken and written English in the academic context of literary analysis.

Write and Illustrate a Picture Book Narrative

In the second half of the unit, students learn how to write a picture book narrative, which they will eventually turn into an ebook. The writing of this narrative is particularly valuable to ELLs because stories are a very accessible genre of writing that can often be more readily undertaken in a new language than other forms of more academic writing. Furthermore, if it is possible to work with an art teacher and have students do illustrations for their books, the opportunity to do so could benefit ELLs by providing them with more than one medium of expression, allowing them to convey details in pictures that they may not know how to convey in English words.

Differentiated Note-Catchers

Differentiated note-catchers are available for ELLs and other students who would benefit from an increased level of support. These resources have been modified for the purpose of reducing linguistic barriers that might interfere with processing content and concepts. Depending upon the task being carried out with a note-catcher, images, selected response options, answer banks, sentence frames, or model responses have been embedded to guide students’ thinking without compromising a focus on standards and the skills that students are developing and applying to meet them.

Celebration

Celebrate the courage, enthusiasm, diversity, and bilingual assets that ELLs bring to the classroom. Additionally, students can celebrate their successful attempts at communication, focusing on progress, rather than perfection.
