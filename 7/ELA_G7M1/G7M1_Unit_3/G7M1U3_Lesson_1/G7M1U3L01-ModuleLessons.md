Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Repeated routines occur in the following:

- Opening A: In the entrance ticket activity, students use strategies to determine the meaning of unknown vocabulary in the learning targets.

- Opening A: Students review the learning target.

- Work Time A: Students read the next chapter of the text, finding the gist, and adding to the Questions about *A Long Walk to Water* anchor chart.

- Closing and Assessment A: Students engage in a collaborative discussion about how comparing the audio to text will help them create their own narrative e-books.

- New skills are introduced in the following:

- RL.7.7 – Work Time B: Students listen to an audiobook excerpt from the chapter and complete a note-catcher to support analysis of how the techniques in the audiobook create certain effects.

- Throughout this unit, if possible, partner with an art teacher for students to begin creating illustrations for their narratives in art class. ▲ If necessary for context, share with the art teacher the illustrations from the children’s book *Brothers in Hope: The Story of the Lost Boys of Sudan* by Mary Luana Williams. Or, if students have access to or can be given access to art supplies, they can create their illustrations for homework. Students will have a sense of the illustrations they want to create beginning in Lesson 4. Encourage them to use any medium to create the illustrations (paint, marker, crayon, colored pencil, torn paper, photographs, etc.) For the performance task, students will have to scan their illustrations in order to include them in their ebook. Another option is for students to modify photographs by changing size, shape, and coloring to match the tone and content of their narratives. These images can be found online. Finally, if none of these options work, students can use the illustrations for *A Long Walk to Water* by Jim Averbeck provided in the Unit 1, Lesson 6 Teacher Supporting Materials.

- Also, consider partnering with an elementary school class so students can share their narrative ebooks with an actual audience, giving the assignment real context and purpose.

- The Think-Pair-Share and Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocols are used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- In chapter 16 of *A Long Walk to Water*, Salva demonstrates perseverance with the English language and with the challenges he faced in returning home. He also demonstrates courage to return to Sudan and initiative in creating travel plans.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- In addition to analyzing the audiobook in this lesson, students will have an opportunity to reflect on how their analysis will support them in the writing of their narratives for the end of unit and performance tasks at the end of the module. Therefore, encourage those students who are proficient at analyzing the audio to begin considering ways to apply their learning to their own narratives. This may take the form of analyzing parts of the text that the note-catcher didn’t cover or asking students to experiment by writing their own sentences or paragraphs and finding opportunities to show emphasis.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Students have been analyzing *A Long Walk to Water* and deepening their understanding of its context with informational sources over the previous two units. This lesson gives them the opportunity to engage with the text through a different medium and in the process consider elements of the storytelling from a fresh perspective.

Support All Students

- Students may need additional support engaging with the comparison of audio to text. Create deliberate partnerships where one student can assume a mentoring role with the other. ▲ For those students with difficulty discerning tones of voice and their emotional content, focus on the objective qualities of the voice, such as volume or accent, to help them make the connection between changes in voice and emotional states.

- At this point, students should be reading the text independently. However, if some or all students need more support, read several pages aloud and then release students to read independently, in pairs, or in small groups.

- The subject matter in this chapter includes struggles to assimilate and to find family members separated in war. Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this lesson that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually.

- Note there is a differentiated version of Compare Audio to Text: *A Long Walk to Water*, Chapter 16 note-catcher used in Work Time B in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson explicitly guides students through the processes of comparing and contrasting audio text and written text. The use of note-catchers and sequenced, modeled steps in this task enables ELLs to successfully perform the task, and extend their understanding of the relationship between spoken and written English.

- ELLs may find comparing and contrasting the audiobook and the novel challenging because of the demands of juggling the relationship between audio and text in a new language. Therefore, additional supports such as the ones listed below may be useful.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standard 7.I.B.6.

Assessment Guidance

- In addition to asking student pairs to share out as they complete the note-catcher, move about the room to monitor discussion between partners to ensure comprehension and correct misunderstanding.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue comparing the text and audio versions of *A Long Walk to Water*, drawing on their work in this lesson and in preparation for their mid-unit assessment, which assesses the same skills. Make arrangements for students to read their ebooks to a real third-grade audience.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.7.4 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: students respond to prompts on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 1**.

- Repeated routine: follow the same routine as in previous lessons to review the learning target and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any similarities between this learning target and those from previous lessons.

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique to review their responses (except for prompt 3, which will be shared during Work Time B). With students, use the vocabulary strategies on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart** to deconstruct the words *techniques* (specific methods for doing something), *version* (a particular form of something), *audio* (related to or using sound), and *effect* (something produced by something else) in the learning target. Record on the **academic word wall**, with translations in students’ home languages where appropriate, and invite students to revise the definitions in their **vocabulary logs**.

For Lighter Support

- Write or type the words while deconstructing them so students have both a visual and aural representation of the words. This supports ELLs by giving them more than one mode through which to understand and recall the word.

For Heavier Support

- Instead of deconstructing all of the words on the list with students, directly define some of the words, and then carefully deconstruct one or two words. The reduction in the amount of metacognitive language makes it easier for ELLs and others to grasp the definitions of all the words covered but still provides opportunities for all students to practice deconstructing the meanings of words.

Work Time

A. Read *A Long Walk to Water*, Chapter 16 – SL.7.1 (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: follow the same process as previous lessons for students to read chapter 16 of ***A Long Walk to Water***, using the **Text Guide: *A Long Walk to Water*** as necessary. If students do not finish reading the chapter within the allotted time, use the **Synopsis: *A Long Walk to Water***, **Chapter 16** document to review the key details from chapter 16. Then have students identify the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary, reflect on their reading as they choose, and record the gist on **sticky notes** using the following resources as appropriate: vocabulary logs, **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**, and **Questions about *A Long Walk to Water*** **anchor chart**.

- Gists:

- **Nya:** men clearing land for new building

- **Salva:** 6 years in Rochester: study business, play volleyball; finds father, goes to visit

- Once students have finished reading and reflecting on the chapter, ask them to go Back-to-Back, Face-to-Face:

“Which habits of character did you see in this chapter? Who demonstrated them? What did they look or sound like?” (Responses will vary. Possible response: Salva demonstrates courage \[to travel back home\], perseverance \[to deal with the challenges\], and initiative \[to create a plan\].)

Work Time

B. Compare Audio to Text – RL.7.7 (20 minutes)

- Review the learning target:

“I can compare and contrast a written story to the audio version of the story and analyze the effect of the techniques.”

- Inform students that they will now listen to an audio version of a section of chapter 16 from *A Long Walk to Water*, which they just read. Tell students that they will be comparing the text and the audio to look for ways that the audio adds to the text or is different from it. Invite students to retrieve their entrance tickets. Ask for volunteers to share their thoughts in response to the entrance ticket questions:

“What are some ways that listening to something read is different from reading it? What can a reader do that words on a page can’t do alone?” (Responses will vary, but may include: When listening to something, you can hear different voices or different emotions. A reader can change how loud or soft or fast or slow they read the text to create different effects.)

- Distribute the **Compare Audio to Text: *A Long Walk to Water***, **Chapter 16 note-catcher** and **Compare Audio to Text: *A Long Walk to Water***, **Chapter 16 note-catcher** ▲ as necessary for students who need extra support. The differentiated note-catcher supports students’ analysis with sentence starters and images. ▲ Tell students that they will now listen to a minute of the audiobook from pages 100–101. Place students in pairs for listening to the audio and answering the questions on the note-catcher. Ask students to only listen to this first reading, paying attention to what they notice about the reader’s voice or technique, so that they can grapple with what is new and different about the audio version of the text. Invite students to write down what they notice in the first portion of the Compare Audio to Text Chapter 16 note-catcher, under “First Listen.” Consult **Compare Audio to Text: *A Long Walk to Water***, **Chapter 16 note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Ask for student responses. (Responses will vary but may include: The reader was a man. He changed his voice for certain parts. He became excited and louder as he read.)

- Now inform students that they will listen to the audio again, and this time, they should focus on the first two questions on the note-catcher. Read these questions aloud. Replay the audio, and invite students to answer the first two questions with their partners. Ask for volunteers to share their responses, and correct any misunderstandings before moving forward.

- Inform students that they will listen to the audio one more time to answer the remaining questions on the note-catcher with their partners. Read the questions aloud. Tell students that for the reflection question, there is no “right” answer, but students should think about how the audio affected their understanding of the text. Direct students’ attention to the graphic organizer. Ask the following questions:

“What are you going to record in this first column? How does that information connect to the information in the next few columns?” (Possible response: All of the columns relate to the same kind of effect, so the effect must show up in the text and in the audio, and have an example that is about both the text and the audio. Each item in each row relates to the next.)

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the learning target.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time B, preview the audio recording by pointing out particular sections students should pay attention to that add to the text or are different from it. Letting students know which sections of the recording to pay close attention to in advance makes the task of following the recording more accessible for ELLs and others.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time B, let students control how many times they listen to, pause, stop, start, and replay the audio recording if they are using individual laptops and headphones. This repeated listening strategy allows ELLs to repeat language they may not understand and think it through again to improve their comprehension.

Closing and Assessment

A. Review Student Answers – SL.7.1 (5 minutes)

- Invite students to share their responses to the “Reflection” section of the Compare Audio to Text Chapter 16 note-catcher. Remind students that they will be writing a narrative for elementary school students that is meant to be read aloud. Invite students to Think-Pair-Share about the following questions:

“How will comparing the audio and text versions of *A Long Walk to Water* help you write your own stories that are meant to be read aloud?” (Since our stories are going to be read aloud for elementary school students, listening to audio versions of the text will help us write in ways that could be more exciting or interesting to listeners.)

- Incorporate reflection on and awareness of the following academic mindset: “My ability and competence grow with my effort.”

- Think-Pair-Share:

“How much effort did you put into comparing the audio to the text? How did your effort affect your ability?” (Possible response: I tried really hard, and that helped me grow my ability to compare audio to text. If I hadn’t tried as hard, I wouldn’t have learned as much.)

- Distribute the **Homework Resources**, and review the format of the document and this lesson’s specific assignment with students.

Homework

A. Preread Anchor Text

- Students should preread chapter 17 of *A Long Walk to Water* in preparation for studying the chapter in the next lesson.
