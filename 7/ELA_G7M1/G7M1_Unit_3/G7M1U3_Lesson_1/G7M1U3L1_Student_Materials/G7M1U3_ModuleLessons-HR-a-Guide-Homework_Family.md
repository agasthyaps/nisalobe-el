**Unit 3:** Write to Raise Awareness: The Lost Children of South Sudan

Common Core State Standards addressed:

- RL.7.1, RL.7.7

- W.7.3, W.7.3a, W.7.3b, W.7.3c, W.7.3e, W.7.4, W.7.6, W.7.10

![](media/image1.png) Guiding Questions and Big Ideas

Who are the Lost Boys of Sudan, and what is their story?

- *The second Sudanese civil war displaced millions of people, including hundreds of thousands of Lost Boys who walked through southern Sudan, Ethiopia, and Kenya in search of a safe haven.*

What are the habits of character the Lost Boys used to survive?

- *The Lost Children persevered to overcome the hardships of war, starvation, thirst, displacement, and threats by wild animals. Many of them show respect, empathy, and integrity as they help each other survive these same hardships. Some of them have also become leaders in the United States or in their home country (like Salva and his organization Water for South Sudan), using their strengths to help others grow, helping care for their environment and shared spaces, and using their learning to do so.*

- *In Sudan, there are water scarcity issues, which means many people do not have easy access to clean water. As a result, most girls and women persevere to walk all day to get water. They also show empathy and respect as they care for others as many people get sick from the only water available, dirty water.*

What will your student be doing at school?

Students will begin Unit 3 comparing *A Long Walk to Water* to the audiobook version of the text, exploring how authors and readers develop tone, mood, and expression. Students will draw on this exploration as they start the second half of the unit, planning and then writing a narrative children’s book about a Lost Boy or Girl of Sudan. Through mini lessons and independent planning work, students focus on developing characters, settings, plot points, and narrative techniques such as pacing, description, and dialogue. Once students complete a draft of their narrative, they convert it into an ebook and publish it by sharing it with others, especially elementary school children.

Central to the EL Education curriculum is a focus on “habits of character” and social-emotional learning. Students work to become effective learners, developing mindsets and skills for success in college, career, and life (e.g., initiative, responsibility, perseverance, and collaboration); work to become ethical people, treating others well and standing up for what is right (e.g., empathy, integrity, respect, and compassion); and work to contribute to a better world, putting their learning to use to improve communities (e.g., citizenship and service).

In this unit, students focus on respect, empathy, and compassion habits of character as they respond to each other’s ideas and skills in written work and in discussions. Also, students focus on integrity and perseverance as they work independently on assessments. Then as they track progress on their assessments, they take responsibility for their own learning. Finally, as students develop an ebook about a Lost Boy or Girl of Sudan, they help others in the class grow as they assist with technology and writing. Also, because students will share their ebooks with an elementary school child in their community, they focus on using their learning to improve their community.

How can you support your student at home?

Talk with your student about the Lost Boys and Girls of Sudan or other children/people displaced from their homes by war or disasters.

Discuss with your student about the habits of character that the Lost Boys and Girls or other children/people need in order to survive hardships.

Talk with your student about the habits of character that the Lost Boys or other children/people need in order to be successful in a new country.

Read and listen to stories (audiobooks are available at the library), discussing how the audio is different from the text and how the audio uses sounds, tones of voice, and other techniques to make meaning.

Unit 3: Homework

Throughout the unit, homework focuses on research reading and determining the meaning of unfamiliar words using context and reference materials.

**Research Reading:** When not reading their anchor text, your student is expected to independently research the topic by reading topic-related books of his or her choice for approximately 20 minutes each day and responding to a prompt of choice in the front of the independent reading journal. These are usually books your student will bring home from school; however, they may be topic related books chosen by the student at the public or home library. Prompts for independent reading can be found in the homework materials provided.

**Create Illustrations:** Additional homework beginning in Lesson 4 involves students creating illustrations for the narrative children’s book they are writing. Students will create these illustrations either in art class or at home and materials (art supplies) will be provided as necessary. Students can use any medium to create the illustrations (paint, marker, crayon, colored pencil, torn paper, photographs, etc.).

Independent Reading

Directions: Remember to record responses to research reading in the front of your independent reading journal and responses to choice reading in the back. Try to choose a different prompt each time. Record any new vocabulary in your vocabulary log. Underline vocabulary found during independent reading.

**Record:**

- Date

- Title and author of your reading book

- Pages you have read

- Prompt

- Response

**Example:**

<u>Date:</u> 10/15/2020

<u>Book Title and Author</u>: *A Long Walk to Water* by Linda Sue Park

<u>Pages Read:</u> 97–121

<u>Prompt:</u> Which habits of character are demonstrated in the text? Explain.

<u>Response:</u> Salva shows perseverance by not giving up learning English, adapting to the very different life in the United States, and working through all the problems of working on his project. Salva also demonstrates empathy, compassion, and improving his community by returning to Sudan and bringing people water.

**Consider using the following independent reading prompts.**[^1]

- How does this text add to your understanding of one of the Guiding Questions of the Module?

- If you listened to audio or watched video, what techniques were used and how did these techniques create meaning?

- Which habits of character are demonstrated in the text? Explain.

- How does (character/person)’s experiences relate to Salva’s?

- How does (character/person)’s experiences relate to Nya’s?

- How does (character/person) grow and change?

- If you were (character/person), what would you do differently?

- Record two or three facts in your own words that you learned from the text.

- Summarize your research reading today in no more than five sentences.

- What questions do you have about the topic after reading?

- Choose one new word from your reading today and analyze it on a vocabulary square:

| Definition in your own words                  | Synonyms (words with the same meaning) |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Words with the same affix or root             | Sketch                                 |
| Translation in home language (if appropriate) |                                        |

Vocabulary

Directions: In the classroom, you have been recording words from your texts in your vocabulary log. Throughout this unit, you have been research reading topic-related books at home to build your knowledge of the Lost Children of Sudan and recording words in your independent reading journal.

Choose a word from your research reading or from a text you’ve read in class and add the word to your vocabulary log. Try to choose a different word to add and to practice a different vocabulary strategy each time. For each word, be sure to add the following:

1.  The definition, or meaning, of the word

<!-- -->

8.  The vocabulary strategy you used to figure out the meaning of the word

9.  A sketch or diagram that helps you to better understand the meaning of the word

Record new vocabulary in vocabulary logs and mark academic vocabulary with a symbol, for example a star:

- Academic vocabulary: words you might find in informational texts on many different topics. For example, the words evidence and rationale are words that could be found in books on any topic.

- Domain-specific vocabulary: words about a particular topic. For example, the words tadpoles, frogspawn, and amphibian are some that would be found on the topic of frogs.

**Vocabulary Strategies**

As a reminder, the vocabulary strategies we’ve been working on in class are:

- Context: Read the sentence around the word.

- Look at the affixes for clues.

- Look at the root of the word for clues.

- Use a dictionary.

- Discuss the word with another person (after attempting some of the above strategies).

[^1]: Some of the prompts will not be appropriate for the text students are reading. Invite students to choose a prompt that works for the text they have just read.
