Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 9

RI.7.6

(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Reread the final sentence from the author’s note of *A Long Walk to Water*: “Keep reading . . . and walk the walk!” (121) Answer the following questions:

What did these words mean to you when you read them? How do they help to explain the purpose of the book?

Possible response: By writing “walk the walk,” the author wants us to do the things that are important to us. In her note, she talks about all the good work Salva has done creating his nonprofit to bring water to people in South Sudan. She also mentions how students like us have helped him in his mission, so these words seem like they are meant to encourage us to do what is right and keep helping those around us.
