**Most Narratives**

- Narratives tell a story about real events or imagined experiences. They can be told from a first person (I) or third person (he/she) point of view.

- Narratives have a clear sequence of events that makes sense and is easy to understand. These texts have the following:

- A beginning that establishes the situation and introduces the characters and/or narrator

- A middle that describes the central problem and explains how the character(s) respond to the problem

- An ending that has a solution/resolution to “wrap up” the problem

- Narratives use pacing to slow down important events in the story and speed up parts of the story that are less important. Authors control the pacing in a narrative in these ways:

- Using dialogue and descriptions to slow down time

- Using transition words and phrases to span time

- Narratives help you understand another’s experience.

**Some Narratives**

- Some narratives use descriptive language.

- Some narratives tell of events far in the past or in very different places.

- Some narratives try to show the habits of character that allow people to do extraordinary things.
