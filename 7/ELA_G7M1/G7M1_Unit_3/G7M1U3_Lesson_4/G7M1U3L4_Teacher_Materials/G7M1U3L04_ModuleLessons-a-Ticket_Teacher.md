(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, answer the following prompts.

“Little Kuol . . . Salva closed his eyes for a few moments, trying to picture his brothers through a **haze** of time and grief.” (106)

What does the word **haze** tell you about what Salva was experiencing? What is the connotation of the word **haze**?

Salva felt the whole atmosphere of the room change. In consulting a dictionary, *haze* is defined as a collection in the air of very fine particles, as of mist, smoke, or dust, that partly obscures vision of distant objects. So, the connotation of the word *haze* is that it is hugely impactful, affecting not just Salva’s mood, but the entire room.
