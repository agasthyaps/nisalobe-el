Homework: Add Transition Words

(For Teacher Reference)

In class, you received and reviewed a handout on narrative transitions words. These words can be used to show the change from one time or space to another. Add transitions to your Narrative Writing Plan graphic organizer in the pacing section. These transitions are notes to remind you to use these transitions or similar ones when you draft your narrative in Lesson 8 for the End of Unit 3 Assessment. (W.7.3c)
