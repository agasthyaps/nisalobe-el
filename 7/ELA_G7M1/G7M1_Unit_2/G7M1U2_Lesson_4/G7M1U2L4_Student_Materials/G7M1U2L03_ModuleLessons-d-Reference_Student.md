Choose and Use Credible Internet Sources

W.7.8

**Name:** **Date:**

You can determine whether an internet source is reliable by identifying the publisher, author, bias, accuracy, and timeliness of the source.

- **Publisher:** A reliable internet source is usually published by the government (.gov), educational institutions (.edu), or nonprofit organizations (.org). Sometimes internet sources published by commercial organizations (.com) are reliable, but not always.

- **Author:** You can tell whether an internet source is accurate by looking at who wrote it and checking the writer’s credentials.

- **Bias:** An internet source that presents both sides of an argument or does not have any bias and that presents facts is also usually reliable.

- **Accuracy:** A reliable internet source should be visually appealing, clean, and uncluttered, with links that work. It should not have many errors in spelling or grammar.

- **Timeliness:** An internet source that is reliable is timely; it does not have out-of-date information.
