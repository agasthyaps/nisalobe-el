Close Reading Guide:  
“The ‘Lost Girls’ of Sudan”

RI.7.1, RI.7.2, RI.7.4, L.7.4

(For Teacher Reference)

**Purpose and Notes**

- The purpose of this close read is for students to trace the way the author develops the two central ideas of the article. Students will use information from this article in the writing of their end of unit assessment as they answer the question, “How has the author of *A Long Walk to Water* used or altered history in the novel?”

- The article has been modified to exclude most of the section “Living in Fear.”

- For the sake of time, the teacher first reads aloud the text. After the text is first read aloud by the teacher, students are prompted by the teacher to reread portions of the text as they answer text dependent questions.

- A note-catcher along with text-dependent questions provide an opportunity for students to determine the two central ideas by first drawing out the common details that are related to each central idea.

- Although there is a lot of challenging vocabulary in this text, this close read focuses only on words needed to understand the main idea and details of each section. Support with definitions of additional words as needed for basic comprehension.

- The vocabulary questions in this close read have been designed to reinforce the strategies introduced in previous lessons. Encourage students to make these connections and to use a wide range of strategies to understand key words and phrases.

- Continue to use discussion protocols (e.g., Turn and Talk, Cold Call, and total participation techniques) to engage all students in collaborative discussion about the text.
