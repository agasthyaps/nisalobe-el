The article “The ‘Lost Girls’ of Sudan” by Ishbel Matheson reports on the girls who fled Sudan during the civil war. Unlike the boys, they have been forgotten by the world.  
After they fled Sudan for Kenya, the “Lost Girls” continued to face many challenges.  
The girls were forced into slavery by those who were supposed to take care of them.  
They were unable to receive the education they desired. Some were sold off to be married to men they didn’t wish to be married to. Often, they became a way for their guardians to make money. The girls were also treated very differently from the boys. While the boys were kept together in a group, the girls were separated and placed with guardians. The guardians often ended up abusing them. Many of the boys were resettled in the United States, but the girls have stayed behind. Even after fleeing their homes to find safety, the Lost Girls of Sudan ended up facing more hardship and abuses.
