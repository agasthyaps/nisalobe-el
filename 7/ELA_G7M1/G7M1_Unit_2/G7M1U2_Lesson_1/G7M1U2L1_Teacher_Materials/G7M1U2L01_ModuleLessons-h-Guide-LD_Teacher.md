Language Dive Guide:  
“The ‘Lost Girls’ of Sudan,” Paragraph 10

RL.7.2, L.7.1a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

But **while many of the boys**—who became known as the ‘Lost Boys’—were resettled in the United States, the girls’ claim for equal treatment was overlooked. (from “The ‘Lost Girls’ of Sudan” by Ishbel Matheson)

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps to address the daily learning target (I can determine two or more central ideas in “The ‘Lost Girls’ of Sudan” article and analyze their development over the course of the text.) and RI.7.2 by inviting students to discuss a central idea from the text. Supporting Standard: L.7.1a

- Guiding Question: The sentence helps respond to the guiding question (Who are the Lost Children of Sudan, and what is their story?) by sharing an experience of the ‘Lost Girls’ of Sudan, who were also impacted greatly by the civil war in Southern Sudan, but not often mentioned. Supporting Standards: W.7.2c

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses the coordinating conjunction but with the purpose of expressing contrast between this sentence and the previous sentence in the text, and the subordinating conjunction **while** to express contrast within the sentence itself. Invite students to discuss each chunk briefly, but encourage extended conversation and practice with the focus structure: **while many of the boys**.

- Practice and Transfer: After discussing the focus structure, students practice using it to discuss how the ‘Lost Boys’ and ‘Lost Girls’ of Sudan were treated differently. Students transfer their understanding of the meaning and structure of this sentence when using transition words to create cohesion and clarify the relationship among ideas during the writing portion of the end-of-unit assessment.

**Time**

10 minutes

Throughout the Language Dive

Encourage rich conversation among students about the meaning of each of the sentence chunk strips, what the academic phrases within each chunk mean, and how they relate to the sentence and the text overall. Monitor and guide conversation with total participation techniques and Conversation Cues.

After asking questions, provide students up to 1 minute of think time to reflect, depending on the complexity of the question. Alternatively, invite partners to discuss, providing an allocated time for each student.

Record and display student responses next to or underneath the target language for visual reference.

Although students should briefly discuss all chunks in each Language Dive sentence, invite them to slow down during one chunk, called the focus structure, to investigate and practice a particularly compelling language structure.

Where possible, place sketches, pictures, or illustrations above key nouns and verbs in the chunks after discussing their meanings. This allows students to quickly access the content of each chunk as they work with the structures in the sentence as a whole.

For translation work, invite students to use their online or paper translation dictionary if necessary. Invite students to add new vocabulary to their vocabulary logs.

Note: Some responses to questions in the Language Dive indicate only that “Responses will vary.” Like one the larger goals of Language Dives, “Responses will vary” is intended to suggest that students should be encouraged to grapple with questions and ideas, develop interest and participation, and not be immediately steered toward “correct” responses. Indeed, even where correct responses are provided, continue to invite a culture of inquiry and grappling.

Launch

- Welcome students to their third Grade 7 Language Dive. Display the term **Language Dive**.

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partner. Say:

“Based on your second Language Dive, what do you think a Language Dive is?” (Responses will vary.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- If productive, cue students to clarify the conversation by confirming what they mean. If necessary, prompt students’ responses with sentence frames: “Yes, you’ve got it” or “No, sorry, that’s not what I mean. What I mean is \_\_\_\_\_.” Say:

“So, do you mean \_\_\_\_\_?” (Responses will vary.)

- Confirm or amend and display students’ ideas.

Deconstruct

- Remind students about the first step in the Deconstruct stage:

“When we do a Language Dive, first we read the sentence. We talk about what we think it means and how it might help us understand our guiding question.”

- Invite students to put their finger by this sentence from “The ‘Lost Girls’ of Sudan” on their note-catchers: **But <u>while many of the boys</u> —who became known as the ‘Lost Boys’—were resettled in the United States, the girls’ claim for equal treatment was overlooked.**

- Read aloud the sentence twice, and then ask students to take turns reading the sentence aloud with their partners.

- Say:

“What does this sentence mean to you?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“How does this sentence add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

But

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following sentence chunk strip: **But**

- Remind students that highlighting language can help them notice important structures and patterns.

- Underline But in green, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 🖉

- Say:

“Can you figure out why the author wrote but?” (But links the idea in the previous sentence to the idea that will be presented in this sentence and signals a contrast between them.)

- Invite students to take 30 seconds in pairs to discuss the idea presented in the previous sentence (**It was an epic march, which captured the attention of the world**) and then predict what contrasting idea might be presented in this sentence. (Responses will vary, but may include there was an epic march where many children persevered through dangerous and difficult times to reach safety. This sentence might be about children who did not reach safety.)

while many of the boys

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Display and read aloud the following sentence chunk strip: **while many of the boys**

- Remind students that highlighting language can help them notice important structures and patterns.

- Underline while in green, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 🖉

- Say:

“Can you figure out why the author uses the word while?” (While tells us the author is going to give two ideas or thoughts that contrast with each other. While connects the two ideas and signals they will not agree. We know the idea in the next chunk will contrast with another idea in the sentence. Other words for while include on the other hand, even though, and although.)

“Who is this chunk about?” (The boys refers to the boys from Sudan who were seeking safety during the civil war in Southern Sudan after losing their parents; we know because it tells us in the first part of this text. Many tells us it was a lot of the boys, but not all of them.)

“What questions does this chunk raise for you?” (Responses will vary, but might include the following: What did many of the boys do? What will we will learn in this sentence that contrasts with what many of the boys did?)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Tell students they will now practice the focus structure:

“You’ve played with this chunk and figured out the meaning. Now let’s use the structure in the sentence for our own speaking and writing.”

- Display the sentence frame:

> **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ I like learning, I get sad about some of the things I learn about.**
>
> (**While** + independent clause + independent clause with contrasting idea.)

- Tell students to use this frame to talk about learning with their partners. Give them time to think and discuss.

- Say:

“Let’s talk about the second chunk.”

—who became known as the ‘Lost Boys’—

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **—who became known as the ‘Lost Boys’—**

- Underline who in green, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 🖉

- Say:

“Can you figure out why the author wrote who?” (Who refers back to many of the boys in the previous chunk and signals that the author will give us extra information about many of the boys.)

“Why does the author include single quotation marks around the ‘Lost Boys’?” (The single quotation marks signal an unofficial title given to the boys who lost their families during the Southern Sudan civil war. While they became known as the ‘Lost Boys’ to the world, the quotation marks tell us this is not their official name, but more of a well-known nickname.)

“Can you figure out why this chunk has dashes around it?” (The dashes are called em dashes and are sometimes used in place of commas. The em dashes are used in this chunk to emphasize the information inside the dashes.)

“Can we figure out why the author included this chunk?” (To give us more information about the boys from the previous chunk. This chunk tells us the boys in the previous chunk are the ‘Lost Boys’ of Sudan, who are well-known. It’s important we know the boys being described are the well-known boys we may have heard of.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- Say:

“Let’s talk about the third chunk.”

were resettled in the United States

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **were resettled in the United States**

- Say:

“What does the word resettled mean? Is there a familiar word or affix in this word that can help us understand the meaning?” (Settle means to start living somewhere. The prefix re- means again. Resettle means to settle somewhere again; to start living in a new place.)

“Who does this chunk tell us about?” (The ‘Lost Boys.’)

“What does this chunk tell us about the ‘Lost Boys’?” (That they started living in the United States; they moved to the United States to resettle.)

- Display and read aloud the first three chunks: **But while many of the boys—who became known as the ‘Lost Boys’—were resettled in the United States,**

- Remind students that **while** signals a contrast between one idea in the sentence and another. Invite students to take 30 seconds to discuss the first idea in the sentence with a partner. (Many of the ‘Lost Boys’ resettled in the United States.)

- Invite students to take another 30 seconds to discuss what they think the contrasting idea will be in the upcoming chunk. (Responses will vary, but may include that the ‘Lost Girls’ were not able to resettle, that the ‘Lost Girls’ were not able to move to have a better life.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- Say:

“Let’s talk about the fourth chunk.”

the girls’ claim for equal treatment was overlooked.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **the girls’ claim for equal treatment was overlooked**.

- Underline the girls’ claim in blue, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 🖉

- Say:

“What do we think the girls’ claim means?” (Claim means a legal right to something. The apostrophe at the end of girls’ tells us the claim, or legal right, belonged to the girls—The ‘Lost Girls’ of Sudan had a legal right to something.)

“What did the girls have a legal right to?” (Equal treatment; the girls had a legal right to be treated the same as the boys)

“What does this chunk tell us about the girls’ claim for equal treatment?” (Overlooked means something was ignored or not paid attention to; this chunk tells us the girls did not receive the same treatment as the boys.)

“What’s another way to say this chunk?” (Responses will vary but may include the following: The girls’ wish to be resettled in the United States was ignored. The girls’ right to leave the refugee camps like the boys was not paid attention to.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

But while many of the boys—who became known as the ‘Lost Boys’—were resettled in the United States, the girls’ claim for equal treatment was overlooked.

Reconstruct

- Say:

“You did well figuring out what all of the chunks mean, and why they’re important.”

- Remind students they will now go from the Deconstruct to the Reconstruct stage:

“Now that you’ve played with the chunks, let’s put them all back together again into a sentence. And let’s see how playing with the chunks adds to our understanding of the meaning of the sentence and our guiding question. Let’s see how reconstructing helps us understand how English works.”

- Point to and read aloud the entire sentence on display: **But <u>while many of the boys</u> —who became known as the ‘Lost Boys’—were resettled in the United States, the girls’ claim for equal treatment was overlooked.**

“What is another way to say this sentence?” (Responses will vary, but may include: Although many of the boys, the ‘Lost Boys,’ moved to the United States for a new life, the ‘Lost Girls’ did not receive the same treatment.)

“What are the two contrasting ideas in this sentence?” (Responses will vary, but may include: Many of the ‘Lost Boys’ were resettled in the United States, gaining their freedom. However, the ‘Lost Girls’ were not treated the same way and did not gain their freedom.)

“What if we remove but in this sentence? How does that change the meaning?” (But signals there is a contrast between this sentence and the one before it, “It was an epic march, which captured the attention of the world.” If we remove but, we would not be signaled that there was something that contrasted the epic march.)

“What if we remove the chunk —who became known as the ‘Lost Boys’—?” Would the sentence still make sense?” (Yes, the sentence would still make sense without this chunk; however, this chunk gives us additional information about who the boys were; it emphasizes that they are the ‘Lost Boys’ we have likely heard a lot about.)

- If productive, cue students to expand the conversation:

“Can you say more about that?” (Responses will vary.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- Say:

“What other questions can we ask that will help us understand this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses will vary.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

Practice

- Say:

“You did well putting the chunks back together again and talking about how this Language Dive has added to your understanding of the meaning of the sentence and the guiding question.”

- Remind students they will now go from the Reconstruct to the Practice stage:

“You’ve played with the sentence and figured out the meaning, and why it’s important to the guiding question. Now let’s start to use the language in the sentence for our own speaking and writing.”

- Display the sentence frame:

> **But while Nya—who was born after the war—is from the Nuer tribe,  
> Salva \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.** (**But** + **while** + \[subject + predicate\] + **Salva** + predicate.)
>
> predicate

- Invite students to use this frame to talk about how Nya and Salva, the two main characters in the novel *A Long Walk to Water*, were from different tribes. Give them time to think and discuss with their partners.

- If productive, cue students to clarify their sentences by confirming what they mean:

“So, do you mean \_\_\_\_\_?” (Responses will vary. Ensure that students are using the structure meaningfully.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- Congratulate students on completing the Language Dive to better understand the meaning of this sentence, how it connects to the guiding question, and how to use it in their own speaking and writing.
