Write to Inform: The Lost Children of South Sudan

Teaching Notes for Unit 2

Prioritize Lessons for Classrooms with Many ELLs

To prepare for the end of unit assessment, prioritize and expand instruction in Lessons 7–11, which introduce how to write a compare and contrast essay with a novel and an informational text. Depending on students’ needs, expand work on writing a focus statement, writing a Proof Paragraph, or writing a conclusion. An in-depth focus on learning how to write a compare and contrast essay is valuable to ELLs because it is a writing task that entails a lot of academic language, which is potentially unfamiliar, as well as a number of academic writing conventions, such as transitions, which may be unfamiliar as well. Language Dives in Lessons 9, 11, and 14 on focus statements, conclusions, and transitions should also help support students’ growing understanding of the academic language associated with essay writing.

Language Dives

In Lesson 1, students do a Language Dive in which they learn how to use and recognize the complex language associated with the central idea of an informational text. In subsequent Language Dives, in Lessons 9 and 11, students explore the complex language associated with an effective focus statement and a reflective conclusion in order to be able to replicate comparable language in their own essays. A Language Dive empowers students to analyze, understand, and use the language of academic sentences, which can often seem opaque to students. During a Language Dive, students slow down for 10–20 minutes to examine the meaning, purpose, and structure of a compelling sentence from a complex text, model, learning target, checklist, or rubric included in the curriculum. This process invites students to unpack complex syntax, or “academic phrases,” as a way to build both literacy and habits of mind. Students then apply their understanding of language structure as they work toward the assessments and performance task. Through the Language Dive’s engaging Deconstruct-Reconstruct-Practice routine, students play with “chunks” of the sentence, interpreting them, rearranging them, and using them to talk about their own lives or lesson content. As a result of paying close attention to how language works, all students begin to acquire the necessary facility with academic English, and ELLs foster their overall language ability. A consistent Language Dive routine is critical in helping all students learn how to decipher complex sentences and write their own.

Diversity and Inclusion

Investigate the routines, practices, rituals, beliefs, norms, and experiences that are important to ELLs and their families. Integrate this background into the classroom as students explore the novel and informational text in the unit. An ideal context for inclusiveness emerges as students are invited to share their thoughts about chapters of *A Long Walk to Water*. Be sensitive to the fact that some ELLs and immigrant students may have firsthand experience of traumatic migration and immigration that mirrors those of the Sudanese characters in *A Long Walk to Water*. Foster inclusive action by creating space for students to express their feelings about sensitive issues embedded in the novel, knowing that these discussions may help create equity or unearth trauma or both. Consult with a guidance counselor, school social worker, or ESL teacher before discussing students’ experiences and for further investigation of diversity and inclusion.

Conversation Cues

Goal 1 Conversation Cues: Encourage productive and equitable conversation with Conversation Cues, which are questions that help students achieve four goals:

- (Goal 1) encourage all students to talk and be understood;

- (Goal 2) listen carefully to one another and seek to understand;

- (Goal 3) deepen thinking; and

- (Goal 4) think with others to expand the conversation (adapted from Michaels, Sarah and O’Connor, Cathy. *Talk Science Primer*. TERC, 2012. http://inquiryproject.terc.edu/shared/pd/TalkScience_Primer.pdf. Based on Chapin, Suzanne, et al. *Classroom Discussions: Using Math Talk to Help Students Learn, Grades K–6*. 2nd ed. Math Solutions Publications, 2009).

Refer to the Tools Page (http://eled.org/tools) for the complete set of cues. Goal 1 Conversation Cues are introduced in Unit 1, Lesson 13. For ELLs, Conversation Cues are especially critical because they improve language processing abilities and increase engagement and participation.

Choosing and Answering Research Questions

Students receive explicit instruction in how to choose and identify research questions. Modeling of the research processes, anchor charts, note-catchers, partner work, and ongoing feedback all support ELLs and other students as they learn how to choose and answer research questions about complex texts, which may have unfamiliar academic language and syntactical structures. The amount of direct instruction with modeling, as well as strategic grouping, anchor charts, note-catchers, and ongoing feedback all help ensure equitable access to research opportunities.

Write a Compare and Contrast Essay

A model-based approach to learning how to write a compare and contrast essay ensures access to effective writing instruction for students with a wide variety of language backgrounds and experience with writing in English. Working with a model essay across a series of lessons, as well as a series of writing-related Language Dives, enables students to plan their essays over the course of the unit and then write their essays during the final assessment for the unit. Having the opportunity to gradually plan their final essays with explicit instructions on how to do the planning supports ELLs by making each step of the process of essay writing and the academic language associated with it transparent and comprehensible. Additionally, for students who are entirely new to writing in English, there are suggestions in the ELL supports for ways to incorporate the use of home languages and text-to-speech software.

Differentiated Note-Catchers

Differentiated note-catchers are available for ELLs and other students who would benefit from an increased level of support. These resources have been modified for the purpose of reducing linguistic barriers that might interfere with processing content and concepts. Depending upon the task being carried out with a note-catcher, images, selected response options, answer banks, sentence frames, or model responses have been embedded to guide students’ thinking without compromising a focus on standards and the skills that students are developing and applying to meet them.
