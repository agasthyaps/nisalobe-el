![](media/image1.png) Guiding Questions and Big Ideas

Who are The Lost Boys of the Sudan, and what is their story?

- *The second Sudanese civil war displaced millions of people, including hundreds of thousands of Lost Boys who walked through southern Sudan, Ethiopia, and Kenya in search of a safe haven.*

What are the habits of character the Lost Boys used to survive?

- *The Lost Children persevered to overcome the hardships of war, starvation, thirst, displacement, and threats by wild animals. Many of them show respect, empathy, and integrity as they help each other survive these same hardships. Some of them have also become leaders in the United States or in their home country (like Salva and his organization Water for South Sudan), using their strengths to help others grow, helping care for their environment and shared spaces, and using their learning to do so.*

- *In Sudan there are water scarcity issues, which means many people do not have easy access to clean water. As a result, most girls and women persevere to walk all day to get water. They also show empathy and respect as they care for others as many people get sick from the only water available, dirty water.*

What will your student be doing at school?

Students begin the unit researching to answer the questions generated while reading *A Long Walk to Water* during Unit 1, including questions about Lost Girls too. While researching, they determine two or more central ideas in informational texts and provide objective summaries of them. Students also watch clips of the documentary *God Grew Tired of Us* about The Lost Boys of the Sudan, analyzing the main ideas and supporting details and explaining how the ideas clarify what they have been researching. In the second half of the unit, students use the Painted Essay<sup>®</sup> structure to write an informative essay comparing and contrasting how the novel and an informational text deal with the subject matter of the Lost Children of Sudan.

Central to the EL Education curriculum is a focus on “habits of character” and social-emotional learning. Students work to become effective learners, developing mindsets and skills for success in college, career, and life (e.g., initiative, responsibility, perseverance, and collaboration); work to become ethical people, treating others well and standing up for what is right (e.g., empathy, integrity, respect, and compassion); and work to contribute to a better world, putting their learning to use to improve communities (e.g., citizenship and service).

In this unit, students focus on the habits of character of respect, empathy, and compassion as they respond to one another’s ideas and skills in written work and in discussions. Also, students focus on integrity and perseverance as they work independently on assessments. Then as they track progress on their assessments, they take responsibility for their own learning.

How can you support your student at home?

Talk with your student about the Lost Boys and Girls of Sudan or other children/people displaced from their homes by war or disasters.

Read books or articles and watch documentaries with your student and summarize the chapters or scenes, noting the themes or central ideas, the message the author/director is conveying. One documentary you can watch with your student is *God Grew Tired of Us*, available online for free streaming. Students watch several short clips from this documentary and may enjoy and benefit from watching the whole film. Also, discuss with your student the research he/she is doing to answer questions about the Lost Children of Sudan. You may use questions such as the following for your conversations:

- What are the main points of this chapter/book/article/documentary? What message is the author/directory trying to send?

- What questions do you have about the Lost Children of Sudan? How are you answering those questions? How do you know your sources are credible (trustworthy)? Does this source answer your question? If so, how? If not, what will you do to try to answer the question?

Unit 2: Homework

In Lessons 1, 4, 7, and 14 students read chapters of *A Long Walk to Water* to prepare for in-class reading and discussion of the chapters.

In Lessons 1 and 2, students answer selected response (multiple choice) questions about the plot (or events) happening in chapter 1 of *A Long Walk to Water* or the documentary *God Grew Tired of Us*.

In Lessons 2–3, 5–6, and 8–13, homework focuses on research reading for which students read a topic-related book of choice and answer a question related to the unit’s ideas and skills.

**Research Reading:** When not reading their anchor text, your student is expected to independently research the topic by reading topic-related books of his or her choice for approximately 20 minutes each day and responding to a prompt of choice in the front of the independent reading journal. These are usually books your student will bring home from school; however, they may be topic-related books chosen by the student at the public or your home library. Prompts for independent reading can be found in the homework materials provided below.

In Lessons 3–4, students work on their researching skills, refining their research questions and revising a summary of one of their sources.

In Lesson 9, students revise their focus statements for their end of unit assessments, making sure they are clear and include at least two main points.

Independent Reading

**Directions:** Remember to record responses to research reading in the front of your independent reading journal and responses to choice reading in the back. Try to choose a different prompt each time. Record any new vocabulary in your vocabulary log. Underline vocabulary found during independent reading.

**Record:**

- Date

- Title and author of your reading book

- Pages you have read

- Prompt

- Response

**Example:**

<u>Date:</u> 09/25/20

<u>Book Title and Author</u>: *A Long Walk to Water* by Linda Sue Park

<u>Pages Read:</u> 51–75

<u>Prompt:</u> How does the setting affect (character/person)? What kind of person does he/she have to be in that setting?

<u>Response:</u> The setting of the desert affects Salva by challenging him almost beyond his limits. He feels he cannot go on, but his uncle tells him to just walk “one painful step at a time” (54). Salva survives the desert with this help from his uncle. This setting makes Salva severely challenged and forces him to be strong, persevere, and rely on the support of others.

**Consider using the following independent reading prompts.**[^1]

- How does this text add to your understanding of one of the guiding questions of the module?

- How does the setting affect (character/person)? What kind of person does he/she have to be in that setting?

- What kind of events does (character/person) experience in the setting?

- From whose point of view is this part of the text told? How does the author develop this person’s/character’s point of view?

- How does reading from the author’s/character’s point of view help you understand something about Sudan?

- What theme or central idea is present in the text you read? Give text details that convey that theme or central idea.

- How does (character/person)’s experiences relate to Salva’s?

- How does (character/person)’s experiences relate to Nya’s?

- How does (character/person) grow and change?

- If you were (character/person), what would you do differently?

- Record two or three facts in your own words that you learned from the text.

- Summarize your research reading today in no more than five sentences.

- What questions do you have about the topic after reading?

- Choose one new word from your reading today and analyze it on a vocabulary square.

| Definition in your own words                  | Synonyms (words with the same meaning) |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Words with the same affix or root             | Sketch                                 |
| Translation in home language (if appropriate) |                                        |

Vocabulary

Directions: In the classroom, you have been recording words from your texts in your vocabulary log. Throughout this unit, you have been research reading topic-related books at home to build your knowledge of Sudan and recording words in your independent reading journal.

Choose a word from your research reading or from a text you’ve read in class and add the word to your vocabulary log. Try to choose a different word to add and to practice a different vocabulary strategy each time. For each word, be sure to add the following:

1.  The definition, or meaning, of the word

<!-- -->

7.  The vocabulary strategy you used to figure out the meaning of the word

8.  A sketch or diagram that helps you to better understand the meaning of the word

Record new vocabulary in vocabulary logs and mark academic vocabulary with a symbol, for example a star:

- Academic vocabulary**:** words you might find in informational texts on many different topics. For example, the words evidence and rationale are words that could be found in books on any topic.

- Domain-specific vocabulary**:** words about a particular topic. For example, the words tadpoles, frogspawn, and amphibian are some that would be found on the topic of frogs.

**Vocabulary Strategies**

As a reminder, the vocabulary strategies we’ve been working on in class are:

- Context: Read the sentence around the word.

- Look at the affixes for clues.

- Look at the root of the word for clues.

- Use a dictionary.

- Discuss the word with another person (after attempting some of the above strategies).

[^1]: Some of the prompts will not be appropriate for the text students are reading. Invite students

    to choose a prompt that works for the text they have just read.
