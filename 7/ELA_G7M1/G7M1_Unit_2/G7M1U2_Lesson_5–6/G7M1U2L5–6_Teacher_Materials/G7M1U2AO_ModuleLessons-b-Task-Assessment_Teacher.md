**Part II**

Read the article “The Need” below. Then answer the questions that follow.

**The Need**

**A basic need, a human right**

South Sudan’s environment is starkly beautiful but harsh. It has just two seasons: one dramatically wet, the other dry. Daily temperatures often rise above 120°F during both seasons. During the rainy season, water is plentiful for villagers, their crops and their animals. But during the annual six-month dry season, life changes for the worst.

**People are dying from water in remote villages of South Sudan**

During the November-to-May dry season, most sources of surface water dry up. This forces millions of South Sudanese each year to leave their village homes in search for water. Some have to abandon their homes and move all together while others, usually women and children, are forced to trek miles every day to collect water from ponds, marshes, ditches, or hand-dug wells. This water is often contaminated with disease-causing parasites and bacteria. The results are pain, sickness, even death, especially among infants and children.

**A constant search to satisfy a basic need**

Villagers have no choice about what they drink. Water, however tainted, is needed to live. Villagers must relocate during the dry season to be near water sources. Only with the arrival of the next wet season can people return to their homes. This annual hunt for water prevents villages from building stable, basic infrastructure such as schools, markets, and medical clinics. Even when villages are able to build clinics or schools, the buildings can stay empty for up to six months a year because the dry season forces villagers to find water.

**Walking hot, dusty miles to satisfy thirst**

When women and children are forced to walk up to eight hours a day for water, they are unable to do anything else. This demanding, time-intensive regimen makes getting an education difficult if not impossible. This is why most children and especially women in South Sudan do not even have an elementary education.

Where safe, clean water flows, education, economic development, and health spring up. Safe water brings new hope and opportunities to South Sudan’s people, empowering them to change their lives.

Use the text “The Need” to answer the following questions.

14. **Part A**

Which of the following are central ideas in the article “The Need”? Select all that apply. (RI.7.2)

15. <u>Clean, safe water is necessary to make life better for people in South Sudan.</u>

16. Daily temperatures often rise above 120°F during both the rainy and dry seasons in South Sudan.

17. <u>During the dry season in South Sudan, the lack of water makes life challenging for the people.</u>

18. Water in South Sudan is often contaminated with disease-causing parasites and bacteria.

**Part B**

Underline the sentence in this paragraph that introduces one of the central ideas from Part A. (RI.7.1, RI.7.2)

South Sudan’s environment is starkly beautiful but harsh. It has just two seasons: one dramatically wet, the other dry. Daily temperatures often rise above 120°F during both seasons. During the rainy season, water is plentiful for villagers, their crops and their animals. **<u>But during the annual six-month dry season, life changes for the worst.</u>**

19. Write an objective summary of the article “The Need.” (RI.7.1, RI.7.2) Be sure that your summary:

- introduces the text with the title and “wraps up” with a concluding statement,

- uses relevant events and important details from the text to explain what happens, and

- is clear and concise.

Sample student response: “The Need” begins with an explanation that water in South Sudan is scarce from November to May during the dry season. The text then continues to develop a central idea that the lack of water makes life challenging for the people by describing the challenges faced by people during the dry season. For example, women and children have to walk long distances to collect water for their families, and the water they collect is unsafe to drink because it is contaminated with parasites and bacteria. The text also describes the impact of these challenges on communities. The text concludes with another central idea that clean, safe water is necessary to make life better for the people of South Sudan, leaving the reader with the desire to help these people.
