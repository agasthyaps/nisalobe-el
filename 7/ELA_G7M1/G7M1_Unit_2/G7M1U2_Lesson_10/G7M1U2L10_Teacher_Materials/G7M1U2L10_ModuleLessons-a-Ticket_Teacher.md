Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 10

W.7.2b

(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, respond to the following prompts.

Take another look at the focus statements you drafted yesterday. What would be the opposite or a different version of your focus statement? What kind of evidence would you look for to support this different version of your focus statement?

Responses will vary. Possible response: The opposite or different version of my focus statement would be that Linda Sue Park changes history to tell the story of the Lost Girls of Sudan. I would have to find evidence of Park explaining the events (or places like camps) concerning the Lost Girls differently than the article portrays these same events or places.
