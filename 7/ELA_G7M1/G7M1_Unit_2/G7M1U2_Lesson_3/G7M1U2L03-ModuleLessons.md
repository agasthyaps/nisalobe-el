Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Repeated routines occur in the following:

- L.7.4 – Opening A: Entrance ticket activity is to use strategies to determine the meaning of the word *research*.

- Opening A: Students review the learning target.

- New skills are introduced in the following:

- W.7.7 – Work Time A: Students grapple with the steps for conducting research on a topic, including refining a research question, evaluating sources, and gathering information.

- Work Time A: Researchers Do These Things anchor chart is co-created.

- W.7.8 – Work Time B: Students refine their research questions and evaluate sources for credibility and reliability.

- In this lesson, students engage in the Think-Write-Pair-Share protocol. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. Students engage in the following protocol in this lesson:

- **Think-Write-Pair-Share** promotes productive and equitable conversations, where all students are given the time and space to think, write, share, and consider the ideas of others. It ensures that all students simultaneously engage with the same text or topic, while promoting written synthesis and the social construction of knowledge.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Students who have experience with any of the research steps should be authorized as experts on those steps and allowed to teach or mentor the class or individual students on the steps. Also, these students can be released to work immediately on research rather than attending to the mini lessons on the research steps.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the first two lessons of this unit, students read or watched information about the Lost Boys (or girls) of Sudan and reviewed taking notes on the main idea and details. Here, they draw on these skills as they read and take notes on the main idea and details of articles to answer their research questions.

Support All Students

- In Work Times A and B, students may need additional support with each of the steps of the research process. Provide sentence frames and modeling to support students with refining research questions. Partner students who might benefit from modeling and support with a student who is skilled at researching and note-taking. For students needing extra support with research, identify several sources (websites, articles, and videos) at varying levels (e.g., from Newsela or Gale databases) that will answer as many of the research questions as possible, and make this list of sources available to them. Or, make the Researchers Do These Things anchor chart a checklist or roadmap that students can use to guide them in the process. ▲

- Optionally, show a video on the basics of using a search engine (or, if students are ready, a video on using advanced search-engine tools). There are also online videos on evaluating sources, quoting, paraphrasing, citing sources, etc.

- Yet another option for support is to use the article “One Day I Had to Run” for the model end of unit assessment essay as the sample source in the mini lessons during Work Time A. Students will then be familiar with the source, which will allow them to understand the model essay better when they begin to analyze it in Lesson 7.

- Note there is a differentiated version of “One Day I Had to Run” by John Deng Langbany used in Work Time A in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- The subject matter in this article includes a house burning, war, deprivation, death, threat of wild animals, being shot at, starvation, bombing, and the violent death of a friend. Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this lesson that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually.

- To support ELLs, this lesson models the research process, step by step. This explicit, sequential modeling of the research process is useful to ELLs because it makes the process of doing research transparent and allows ELLs to understand the process through the concrete means of a demonstration, which can be more supportive than language-dense directions or explanations.

- ELLs may find following the demonstration of the research process difficult if the steps are delivered too fast, since rapid, sequential speech can be difficult to follow in an unfamiliar language. Therefore, the suggestions below around pausing and paraphrasing may be useful.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.B.6, 7.I.B.7, 7.I.B.8, 7.II.B.3–5, and 7.II.C.6–7.

Assessment Guidance

- Circulate to monitor students’ ability to refine their questions, evaluate sources, identify important information, and take notes (including quoting, paraphrasing, and citing sources).

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue researching and will choose one source to summarize. Then students will conduct a whole-class critique of one student’s summary.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Before modeling the research process for students, test drive the research process and find suitable links to use in Work Time A. Practice the process to ensure the links work and the process goes smoothly. Use the suggestions in Work Time A to choose a research question from the Questions about *A Long Walk to Water* anchor chart, and then do the following to prepare:

- Refine the question.

- Use search terms or keywords in a search engine.

- Evaluate the sources on the results page.

- Choose one reliable, credible source.

- Review it to find several pieces of information to answer the model question.

- Record the information in quotes or paraphrases.

- Ensure there is a copy of Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 3 at each student’s workspace.

- Gather devices on which students can conduct research (computers or tablets). Make sure they work, are charged, and can access the internet.

- Post the applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.7.4 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 3**.

- Repeated routine: follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review the learning target and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students if the learning target is similar or the same as in previous lessons.

- With students, use the vocabulary strategies on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart** to deconstruct the word *research* (to look into carefully and closely so as to learn the facts). At this time, students can share their definitions for the word research that they determined on their entrance tickets. Record on the **academic word wall** with translations in home languages, where appropriate, and invite students to record in their **vocabulary logs**.

Work Time

A. Mini Lessons: Introduction to Research – W.7.7 (20 minutes)

- Inform students that in this lesson, they will begin to research to answer a question they have about the Lost Boys of Sudan. Display the **Questions about *A Long Walk to Water*** **anchor chart**, and remind students that they have been collecting questions about the novel. Note also that some of the questions they have raised are more aligned to research because they are open-ended and have more than one answer. Explain and record on **chart paper** that research questions align to these criteria:

<!-- -->

- Not too narrow or too broad

- Specific to this topic

- Significant: important not only to you, but to others

- Can be answered using sources (i.e., not philosophical questions)

<!-- -->

- Model using these criteria to evaluate one or more of the questions on the Questions about *A Long Walk to Water* anchor chart. Then ask students to Turn and Talk about which questions are better for research. Have students call out suggestions, and confirm or star them on the anchor chart.

- Guide students through an intentional Think-Write-Pair-Share to select one or two research questions from the anchor chart that interest them. Students should also explain in writing and to their partner why the questions interest them:

- Move students into pairs, and invite them to label themselves A and B.

- Pose the question or task, and give students time to think and write independently about their response.

- Invite partner A to ask partner B the question.

- Give partner B a specified timeframe (e.g., 30 seconds, 1 minute) to share his or her response.

- Have partners reverse roles and repeat steps 3–4.

- Using a total participation technique (e.g., cold call, equity sticks), invite students to share their responses with the whole group.

- Before teaching students the steps of researching, ask them to grapple and Think-Write-Pair-Share about how they would conduct research to answer their questions. As students are collaborating, display the **Researchers Do These Things anchor chart**. During the Share, note the correct responses in the correct order on the anchor chart. Review the following steps and teach only those that the class needs to learn. If there is a small group of students who need to learn the steps, release the other students to begin researching, and teach the small group the following skills.

- **Refine Research Questions:** Explain that when we research, we often have to break down our initial research question into smaller, more specific questions. Model selecting a general open-ended question from the anchor chart and breaking it into smaller questions. Ideally, model selecting one that no student has chosen and can be answered by the article **“One Day I Had to Run” by John Deng Langbany** and **“One Day I Had to Run” by John Deng Langbany** ▲ as necessary for students who need extra support. The differentiated article supports students’ comprehension with gists for each section ▲. Use a Think Aloud to show how to determine how to break down the question. An example follows below:

“Which parts of the story are real? Note that we look at which parts of this question are most general, such as ‘parts.’” Explain that we can make “parts” more specific to break down the question into smaller questions: “Which parts of Salva’s story are real? Which parts of Nya’s story are real? Was there really a civil war in Sudan? Did the Dinka and Nuer really fight and kill each other? Did people really walk to Ethiopia? Do girls really walk all day, every day to water?” Note how these questions all seem like separate research projects, so we will have pick one and see if we can break it down into smaller questions. For example, “Which parts of Salva’s story are real? Was there really a civil war in Sudan? Did people really walk to Ethiopia?”

- Explain that once we have a few more specific questions, we can begin to conduct research. Focus students on the Researchers Do These Things anchor chart, and read aloud the first three bullet points, noting that we have already completed the first two and will now be moving on to the third step: use search terms in a search engine to find sources to answer questions. Also, explain that as students complete the different phases of research, they may likely find that they can refine their research question further or may even modify it depending on the information that they find. ▲

- **Use a Search Engine:** Display a search engine (such as Google), and model brainstorming search terms or keywords to find sources to answer the model question (Dinka and Nuer conflict in Sudan; walk to Ethiopia in Sudanese civil war; girls in Sudan walk to water). If students have a lot of experience with online research, teach them advanced search tricks, or have a knowledgeable student do so. If students are new to using a search engine for research, teach them the basics of brainstorming and refining search terms or keywords. If necessary, note these steps on the Researchers Do These Things anchor chart:

“Type one of your specific research questions or keywords from the question directly into the search bar. Scan the results to see if any look like they will help you answer your question and if they come from reliable sources. If not, think of other ways to ask the question or use more specific search terms or keywords or use more advanced search tools.” If necessary, provide a list of keywords students can use to answer their research questions.

- **Determine the Relevance of Sources:** Model scanning the results page to identify the relevance of sources. Explain that *relevance* means “related to what is being discussed,” and give examples from everyday life: “If we are talking about our favorite fruit and I bring up shoes, my comment will have no relevance in this discussion. But if I bring up apples, then my comment does have relevance in this discussion.” If necessary, use visuals or sketches to illustrate *relevance* (pictures of fruit and a picture of shoes with question mark or x through it). Model scanning the results page and asking,

“Does this source look like it will answer my question?”

- Invite students to join in evaluating the relevance of the sources.

- **Determine the Credibility of Sources:** Once researchers have identified relevant sources, explain that they have to determine the credibility of a source. Explain that *credibility* means “being believable.” Display and distribute the **Choose and Use Credible Internet Sources handout**, and read aloud the first bullet (about the publisher), asking students to follow along. Model using this criteria to evaluate the relevant sources on the results page. Invite students to join in evaluating the credibility of the sources. Click on one of the sources and read aloud each of the other bullet points from the Choose and Use Credible Internet Sources handout, using them as a checklist to verify the credibility of the source. Invite students to join in evaluating the credibility of the source. If students need additional support or practice, display several different sources and ask students to work together to label them as credible or not.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time A, pause periodically after describing each of the research steps to paraphrase what was said in more direct, comprehensible language, or ask a student to do so. Pausing and paraphrasing when verbally presenting a series of steps provides wait time and additional opportunities for ELLs to process the language associated with the complex directions being given.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time A, when students Think-Write-Pair-Share about how they would conduct research to answer their questions, give them a short list of ways to conduct research to review before having them write and share their approaches to research. A list such as this supports ELLs who may not have the language to describe the ways they imagine conducting research and allows them to better participate in the productive challenge of writing about their ideas and sharing them with a partner. To further scaffold students who need it, also provide sentence frames for describing some of the research approaches on the list.

Work Time

B. Research – W.7.8 (15 minutes)

- Redirect students’ attention to the learning target:

“I can research to answer questions about the Lost Children of Sudan.”

- Ask students to work to refine their research question, breaking it down into several more specific questions. Students who are ready can work independently. Those who need more support may want to join with one or two other students who are answering the same question. Circulate and support students using the suggestions in the above section on refining research questions, drawing them into a small group as necessary.

- Once students have refined their research question and generated a list of more specific questions, release them to design a note-catcher and begin researching, being careful to assess their sources. (Mini lessons on designing a note-catcher and taking notes are included in the following lesson: Unit 2, Lesson 4.) Circulate and support students using the suggestions in the above sections Use a Search Engine and Determine the Credibility of Sources.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the learning target.

Closing and Assessment

A. Partner Share (5 minutes)

- Ask students to review their notes and annotate the most interesting or strongest information they found to answer their question. Then have students form pairs (or small groups of pairs if they worked in pairs in the previous activity) to share their refined question and the interesting or strong information they found to answer it.

- Incorporate reflection on and awareness of the following academic mindsets: “I can succeed at this” and “My ability and competence grow with my effort.”

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What helped you to be successful at the research tasks? How much effort did you put in on these tasks? How did your effort affect your learning?” (Possible responses: I was successful at researching because I focused and worked hard. I also worked and talked with my peers and my teacher, which grew my learning.)

For Lighter Support

- The chance to share research questions and information with pairs and triads in this section provides an opportunity for ELLs to stretch their spoken language skills because they have the support of what they have already written down on the topic to help them express their thoughts and ideas to others.

For Heavier Support

- Provide sentence stems to help students share their research observations with partners and the whole class.

- My research question was . . .

- Some strong evidence to support the question was . . .

- I was successful at my research because . . .

Homework

A. Continue Refining Questions

- As necessary, students complete **Homework: Continue Refining Questions** to continue refining their research questions based on the research they conducted today.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their independent reading journal.
