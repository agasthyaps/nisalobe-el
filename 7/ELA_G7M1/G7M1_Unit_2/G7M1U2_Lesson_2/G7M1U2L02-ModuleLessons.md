Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Repeated routines occur in the following:

- Opening A: Entrance ticket activity reviews and compares terms *main ideas* and *central ideas*.

- Opening A: Students review learning targets.

- Work Time A: Students read the next chapter of the text, finding the gist, and adding to the Questions about *A Long Walk to Water* anchor chart.

- New skills are introduced in the following:

- SL.7.2 – Work Time B: Students determine the main idea(s) and supporting details of an excerpt from the video *God Grew Tired of Us* in order to better understand the context of the novel.

- SL.7.2 – Work Time B: Students add informational summary criteria to the Criteria of an Effective Summary anchor chart.

- The Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face and Think-Pair-Share protocols are used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- In the chapter of *A Long Walk to Water* read in this lesson, the drill boss uses joking, hard work, and stern talks to keep his workers working, which demonstrates that he takes initiative and shows collaboration, empathy, and respect. Salva also uses joking, hard work, and stern talks to keep the boys walking and working together, which demonstrates that he takes initiative and shows collaboration, empathy, and respect. Finally, the boys show perseverance as they endure hardships and yet keep walking from Ethiopia to Kenya.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Ask those students identifying the main ideas and supporting details of the video with ease in Work Time B to consider ways in which the video presents information in a similar way to the texts they’ve read so far and ways that the video is different in its presentation of information. (SL.7.2)

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Throughout the module, students have been reading and analyzing *A Long Walk to Water* and deepening their understanding through related informational texts. In this lesson, students engage with a documentary about the Lost Boys of Sudan, both to increase their background knowledge of the subject and to refine their skills in analyzing and discussing diverse media formats.

Support All Students

- In Work Time A, students should read the chapter independently. However, if some or all students need more support, read several pages aloud and then release students to read independently, in pairs, or in small groups.

- In Work Time B, students watch the video clip twice—once to note main idea and gist, and once to note surprising or interesting details in their note-catchers. To facilitate understanding of the video for ELLs and other students, optionally add a third viewing, preceding the first two, and allow students just to watch the video with no assigned task. This previewing without an activity can acclimate students to the video’s language and structure so that they will be better able to give their full attention to the prescribed tasks in the two viewings that follow.

- After this previewing and in preparation for the next viewing, in which students will record the main idea and gist of the video in their note-catchers, ask the class to share a few predictions about what they think the main idea and gist might be and then point out that they can see if their predictions are right as they view the video again to record main idea and gist. This very brief public discussion of possible main ideas can help students uncertain of how to start attending to main ideas in the video by giving them some likely starting points.

- Students may need additional support with writing a summary in Work Time B. Place those who will need additional support in one group to receive support.

- Note there is a differentiated version of Main Ideas and Supporting Details: *God Grew Tired of Us* (11:07–13:30) note-catcher used in Work Time B in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- The subject matter in this video includes food insecurity and war. Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this lesson that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually.

- To support ELLs, this lesson teaches students how to recognize and summarize the main idea and details in a video, which will stretch and further develop ELLs’ capacity for understanding spoken English.

- ELLs may find it challenging to follow the language of the video while also identifying the main ideas and details because it may require a lot of effort for them to understand all the spoken words in the video. Therefore, additional supports such as the ones listed below may be useful.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standard 7.I.B.6.

Assessment Guidance

- Monitor students as they work on their Main Ideas and Supporting Details: *God Grew Tired of Us* note-catchers in order to ensure understanding of the task.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will begin conducting independent online research to answer questions they’ve chosen from the Questions about *A Long Walk to Water* anchor chart. This work helps build background knowledge about Sudan and its wars and people.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 2**. Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique to review their responses.

- Repeated routine: follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

- At this time, students can share their analysis of the difference between the terms *main* and *central ideas*.

Work Time

A. Read *A Long Walk to Water*, Chapter 13 (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: follow the same process as with previous lessons for students to read chapter 13 of ***A Long Walk to Water***, using the **Text Guide: *A Long Walk to Water*** as necessary. If students do not finish reading the chapter within the allotted time, use the **Synopsis: *A Long Walk to Water***, **Chapter 13** document to review the key details from chapter 13. Then have students identify the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary, reflect on their reading as they choose, and record the gist on **sticky notes** using the following resources as appropriate: **vocabulary logs**, **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**, and **Questions about *A Long Walk to Water*** **anchor chart**.

- Gists:

- **Nya:** trouble drilling but boss keeps them working

- **Salva:** leads boys to new camp in Kenya; 1½ years walking

“Which habits of character did you see in this excerpt? Who demonstrated them? What did they look or sound like?” (The drill boss demonstrates that he takes initiative and shows collaboration, empathy, and respect for his workers when he uses joking, hard work, and stern talks to keep them working. Salva also demonstrates that he takes initiative and shows collaboration, empathy, and respect when he uses joking, hard work, and stern talks to keep the boys walking and working together. The boys show perseverance as they endure hardships and yet keep walking from Ethiopia to Kenya.)

Work Time

B. Analyze Main Ideas and Supporting Details in Video – SL.7.2 (20 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze the main ideas and supporting details in a clip from *God Grew Tired of Us*.”

- Inform students that they will now watch a clip from the documentary *God Grew Tired of Us* and use a note-catcher to keep track of their ideas. Display and distribute the **Main Ideas and Supporting Details: *God Grew Tired of Us*** **note-catcher** and the **Main Ideas and Supporting Details: *God Grew Tired of Us*** **note-catcher** ▲ as necessary for students who need extra support. The differentiated note-catcher supports students’ analysis and summary writing with images and sentence starters. ▲

- As necessary, have students grapple to explain and give examples of the video techniques from the key (images, maps, graphics, narration, interviews, music). Also, review the note-catcher and where they will write notes about details, main ideas, and the summary. As necessary, model using the note-catcher.

- Then play the video clip once through without interruption or note-taking, to support engagement and comprehension.

- Invite students to Turn and Talk with their partner, and then select volunteers to share out. (To support all students, break down this activity: students Turn and Talk and then share out on each question separately.)

“What is the gist of this clip? What is it mostly about?” (life in a refugee camp)

“What is the main idea of the clip?” (The boys were safer in the new camp, but life was still difficult.)

- Explain that students will view the video another time, so if they don’t yet know the main idea, they will have another chance to identify it. Play the clip for students again, inviting them to identify important images and dialogue from the movie, writing the details in the appropriate boxes on their note-catchers.

- Use **equity sticks** to select students to share out their responses to the following questions:

“How do certain images or conversations from the video help you understand it better? How do these details help support the main idea?” (Refer to Main Ideas and Supporting Details: *God Grew Tired of Us* note-catcher \[example for teacher reference\] as necessary.)

- Play the clip again as necessary.

- Focus students on the supporting details section of the note-catcher, and invite them to work with their partner to identify and record details that support the main idea.

- Use equity sticks to select students to share out. Refer to Main Ideas and Supporting Details: *God Grew Tired of Us* note-catcher (example for teacher reference) as necessary.

- Ask students to complete the summary section of the note-catcher by writing about the main idea and the supporting details of the clip.

- Display the **Criteria of an Effective Summary anchor chart**, and ask students to Think-Pair-Share about the differences between a literary and an informational summary. Record student responses on the anchor chart. (Responses should include the following: Informational summaries include evidence such as facts, quotes, data, and images. Informational summaries don’t end with a theme statement.)

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time B, before playing the video clip a second time, list and state three or four images students should pay attention to, and notice how they convey the main ideas in the video. Encourage students to analyze these images in their note-catchers. By focusing and narrowing the scope of the viewing task, this support scaffolds ELLs, who may not understand all the language in the video.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time B, in addition to following the steps for supporting ELLs suggested in the lesson itself, provide students with a list of specific images to attend to when watching the video. These should be images that embody the main idea of the video and that students can use to help them fill out the note-catcher and participate in the whole-class share. Preselecting some images for students to focus on supports ELLs by allowing them to pay more attention to understanding the language of the video and less attention to searching for the most relevant images.

- As always when showing video, consider using or creating captions or subtitles. This supports ELLs by giving them more than one modality through which to understand the language of the video and also by helping them to better connect spoken and written English.

Closing and Assessment

A. Make Connections – RL.7.9 (5 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can explain how the ideas in the video answer our questions about the Lost Boys of Sudan.”

- Display the Questions about *A Long Walk to Water* anchor chart from Unit 1. Guide students through the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol so they can discuss with a partner which questions from the chart were answered by the video. Have students record the question(s) and how it was answered by the video on the **Make Connections note-catcher**. As volunteers share their responses with the class, record them on the anchor chart to support all students.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- Prior to asking students to do the note-catcher activity, record a sample question with students and a sample example of how the video answered the question. Modelling a task and providing a concrete example of how to do a task directly provides ELLs with some of the language they will need to do the task.

For Heavier Support

- Prefill questions that were answered in the video.

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their independent reading journal.

B. Selected Response Questions

- Students complete **Homework: Main Idea and Details: *God Grew Tired of Us*** **(11:07–13:30)** to scaffold their understanding about main ideas and details and to prepare for similar questions on the mid-unit assessment.
