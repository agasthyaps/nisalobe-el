<td>There are probably many reasons for the<br />
differences in focus. One reason may be<br />
that Langbany and Salva were different<br />
ages during the time described. This<br />
means that they had different views.<br />
Even if they went through the same<br />
events, they would have experienced them<br />
differently. Regardless, it is clear that<br />
Park found meaning in historical events.<br />
In her novel, she uses the experiences of<br />
real people like Salva to offer an inspiring<br />
message of hope and perseverance.</td>
