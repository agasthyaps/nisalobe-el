Language Dive Guide: Compare and Contrast Model Essay, Conclusion

W.7.2f

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

**Although** the article and the novel focus on different parts of the journey, they discuss similar events. (from the fourth paragraph of the Compare and Contrast Model Essay)

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the Daily Learning Target (I can plan a conclusion that includes a strong reflection.) and W.7.2f by providing a model of an effective concluding statement.

- Guiding Question: The sentence helps students respond to the guiding question (Who are the Lost Children of Sudan, and what is their story?) by comparing two texts written about the Lost Children of Sudan.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses the subordinating conjunction **although** with the purpose of contrasting two ideas within the sentence. Invite students to discuss each chunk briefly, but encourage extended conversation and practice with the focus structure: **although**.

- Practice and Transfer: After discussing the focus structure, students practice using it to discuss something they like and dislike in the novel *A Long Walk to Water*. Students transfer their understanding of the meaning and structure of this sentence when writing the conclusion paragraph for their compare and contrast essay during this lesson, and when writing their conclusion paragraph during the End of Unit 2 Assessment.

- Invite students to put their finger by this sentence from the End of Unit 2 Compare and Contrast Model Essay on their note-catchers: **<u>Although</u> the article and the novel focus on different parts of the journey, they discuss similar events.**

- Read aloud the sentence twice, and then ask students to take turns reading the sentence aloud with their partners.

Although

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Display and read aloud the following sentence chunk strip: **Although**

- Underline Although in green, and invite students to do the same on their **Language Dive: Compare and Contrast Model Essay, Conclusion Note-Catcher**. 🖉

- Say:

“Can you figure out why the author uses the word although?” (Although signals that the author is going to give two ideas or thoughts that contrast with one another. It connects the two ideas and signals they will not agree.)

- Invite students to discuss other words the author could use without changing the meaning of the sentence. (**even though**, **though**, **while**)

- Remind students of the Language Dive in the first lesson of this unit, which used **while** with the same purpose as **although** in this sentence: But **while many of the boys**—who became known as the ‘Lost Boys’—were resettled in the United States, the girls’ claim for equal treatment was overlooked.

- Underline they in blue, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 🖉

- Say:

“Who or what does they refer to in this chunk?” (They refers to the article and the novel; we know because the first chunk was about the article and the novel.)

“What does this chunk tell us?” (That the article and the book discuss, or write in detail about, similar events. This means they both write about things that happened that are similar, or alike.)

- Invite students to discuss with a partner the similar events that were written about in both the article and the novel. (Responses will vary, but may include they both describe the journey from Sudan to the United States, as mentioned in the second paragraph of the Compare and Contrast Model Essay.)

Although the article and the novel focus on different parts of the journey, they discuss similar events.

Reconstruct
