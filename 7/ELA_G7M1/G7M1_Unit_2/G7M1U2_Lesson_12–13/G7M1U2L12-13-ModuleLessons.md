Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Two lessons have been allocated for this assessment to ensure sufficient time for students to draft their informative essays. If these are taught in two separate lessons rather than together as one block, revisit the learning targets and the task at the beginning of the second 45-minute lesson to remind students of the task and purpose. Be sure to collect written work at the end of each session.

- Repeated routines occur in the following:

- Opening A: In the entrance ticket activity, students consider how previous lessons prepared them for the assessment task.

- Opening B: Students review the learning target.

- New skills are introduced in the following:

- Work Time A: Students complete their end of unit assessments, in which they write the essays they’ve been planning over the previous several lessons. Students draw on evidence to compare and contrast the novel *A Long Walk to Water* and the informational article “The ‘Lost Girls’ of Sudan” to analyze how the author of the novel uses or alters history. (RL.7.1, RL.7.9, RI.7.1, W.7.2, W.7.4, W.7.6, W.7.9, W.7.10)

- W.7.2 – Closing and Assessment A: Students track their progress on writing informative essays, evaluating how effectively they introduced their topic, provided evidence, and concluded their essay.

- This is a baseline assessment, so look for grammar, usage, and mechanical error patterns that can be taught in future but not assessed now.

- The Think-Pair-Share protocol is used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Encourage those students who finish the assessment early to begin tracking their progress and revising or adding to their essays to meet their informative writing goals.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In Units 1 and 2, students have been closely examining *A Long Walk to Water* and informational texts related to the history and context of the events in the novel. Over the past several lessons, students have been refining skills related to comparing and contrasting texts and planning the essay they are writing in this lesson.

Support All Students

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment.

- Some students may require more than the time allotted to complete the assessment.

- Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this lesson that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually.

- To support ELLs, this lesson ensures that students have the scaffold of their own essay plans, developed in the three previous lessons, to support their drafting of an essay during the end of unit assessment. Having ELLs develop and use essay-planning documents gives them a self-designed “bank” of vocabulary, sentences, concepts, and linguistic structures to draw on as they compose, allowing them better opportunities to elaborate on and develop their thoughts in writing.

- As in the previous writing lesson, ELLs new to writing in English may find writing the drafts of their essays in English challenging, and may therefore produce more stilted, less elaborated prose than they are capable of writing in their home language. Therefore, additional supports such as the ones listed below may be useful.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.2, 7.I.A.3, 7.I.A.4, 7.I.B.6, 7.II.A.1, 7.II.A.2, 7.II.B.5, 7.II.C.6, and 7.II.B.7.

Assessment Guidance

- Assessment materials (student copy, annotated student exemplar) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback to students on this assessment, use the Informative Writing Rubric (see Module 1 Teacher Guide: Appendix and/or Tools Page, https://eled.org/tools) and the annotated sample essay to help complete the student Tracking Progress recording form (see Assessment Overview and Resources). Consider making notes in the appropriate column for each criterion in a different color from student responses. There is also space provided to respond to student comments.

- In this assessment, students are tracking progress toward the following anchor standard:

- W.2: By the end of Grade 12 I will be able to: write informative/explanatory texts to examine and convey complex ideas and information clearly and accurately through the effective selection, organization, and analysis of content.

- Save a copy of the scored essays to use as a baseline assessment. These pieces can be used to measure the progress of individual students throughout the year, as well as to identify common instructional needs in a class.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will engage in peer critique of each other’s essays, focusing on improving transitions and spelling. Students will then have an opportunity to incorporate their peers’ feedback.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Return Mid-Unit 2 Assessments with Feedback (5 minutes)

- Return students’ **Mid-Unit 2 Assessment: Research to Answer a Question** with feedback, and follow the same routine established in Unit 1 for students to review feedback and write their name on the board if they require support.

Opening

B. Engage the Learner — W.7.2 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lessons 12–13**. Ask students to Turn and Talk to share their responses.

- Repeated routine: follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review the learning target and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students if the learning target is similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. End of Unit 2 Assessment: Compare and Contrast *A Long Walk to Water* and “The ‘Lost Girls’ of Sudan” (65 minutes)

- Review the learning target:

“I can write an essay comparing and contrasting the events in *A Long Walk to Water* with a historical account of the same events.”

- Invite students to retrieve the following materials:

- **Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer**

- **Informative Writing checklist or Criteria of an Effective Informative Essay anchor chart**

- Tell students that, for this assessment, they will draft their essays based on their notes in their Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer. They will revise the essays in the next lesson. ▲

- Students may also need to draw on the following materials to find further evidence or check their quotes or paraphrases:

- **Similarities and Differences: *A Long Walk to Water*** **and “The ‘Lost Girls’ of Sudan” note-catcher**

- ***A Long Walk to Water***

- **“The ‘Lost Girls’ of Sudan” article**

- Some students may need the additional support of language structures and vocabulary from the **Compare and Contrast Model Essay**, **academic word wall**, **domain-specific word wall**, their **vocabulary logs**, and **online or print dictionaries (including ELL and home language dictionaries)**. ▲

- Distribute **End of Unit 2 Assessment: Compare and Contrast *A Long Walk to Water*** **and “The ‘Lost Girls’ of Sudan.”**

- Read aloud the prompt while students follow along silently. Answer clarifying questions.

- Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners** and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor charts**. Remind students that because they will be writing independently for the assessment, they will need to practice perseverance and integrity. Have students Think-Pair-Share:

“What value does this writing task have for you? What does this mean to you beyond the work you are doing in the classroom? What will help you to feel you can succeed at this?” (Responses will vary. Possible response: Writing this essay will help me write other essays on tests and in other classes in middle and high school and in college. If I know the expectations for the essay and I work hard, I will be successful.)

- Remind students that they planned this essay in the previous lessons.

- Invite students to begin the assessment.

- While students are taking the assessment, circulate to monitor and document their test-taking skills.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the learning target.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time A, supply students with an optional word list, which can support them in the drafting of their essays. The word list could have words from the unit that any student would find beneficial for the essay assignment, or it can be more tailored to the needs of individual students, based on a review of students’ planning documents and their language needs. Word lists remind ELLs of familiar words they can use to express ideas they may not know the language for.

For Heavier Support

- As in Lessons 10 and 11, let students with no experience writing in English write their essay drafts in their home language, or let them use speech-to-text software, through which they can dictate their drafts in their home language or in English, and then read the digital transcription from which they can compose their draft in English. Both of these strategies allow writers new to English to fully develop their ideas before having to translate them into English in the revision of their essay in the next lesson.

Closing and Assessment

A. Track Progress – W.7.2 (15 minutes)

- Give students specific, positive feedback on their completion of the End of Unit 2 Assessment: Compare and Contrast *A Long Walk to Water* and “The ‘Lost Girls’ of Sudan.”

- Focus students on the Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart. Remind students that they will take responsibility for their own learning as they track their progress.

- Distribute **sticky notes**, **Track Progress folders**, and **Track Progress: Informative Writing**.

- Tell students the sticky notes are for them to find evidence of the following criteria:

- I introduce the topic clearly, giving readers a preview of the piece.

- I use relevant facts, definitions, details, quotations, and examples to explain my thinking.

- I have a conclusion that supports the information presented.

- Guide students through completing the recording form.

- Incorporate reflection on and awareness of the following academic mindsets: “I can succeed at this” and “My ability and competence grow with my effort.”

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What helped you to be successful at that task? How much effort did you put in on this task? How did your effort affect your learning?” (Responses will vary. Possible response: Focusing and working hard helped me be successful and learn how to self-assess.)

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their independent reading journal.
