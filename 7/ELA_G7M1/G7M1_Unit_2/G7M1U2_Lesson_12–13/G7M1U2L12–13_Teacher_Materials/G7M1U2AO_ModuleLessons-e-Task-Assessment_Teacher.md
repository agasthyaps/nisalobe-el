The Second Sudanese Civil War forced millions of people from their homes. This included thousands of “Lost Children” from Sudan. Like the character Salva in *A Long Walk to Water* by Linda Sue Park, these children were forced to wander in search of somewhere safe. Their journey took them through southern Sudan, Ethiopia, and Kenya. *A Long Walk to Water* is a novel, but it is based on history. Other texts tell us about these events as well. “The ‘Lost Girls’ of Sudan” by Ishbel Matheson tells the story of some of the “Lost Girls” of Sudan. Comparing the two texts shows that Park’s novel is historically accurate. Many of the details about people and places are the same in both texts. However, the authors focus their attention differently in the two accounts.

The novel and Matheson’s article describe similar places and people. For example, Park writes about Kakuma, the refugee camp in Northern Kenya. Matheson writes about the camp as well. Both authors describe how bad things were at Kakuma. Park explains that “Kakuma had been a dreadful place” (84). Matheson explains how a doctor called it “a prison, where young women are especially vulnerable.” This is one real life place they both describe similarly. Both authors also talk about the role of women in Sudan. Matheson describes the lives of the women living at Kakuma. She writes about a girl at the camp, Grace Anyieth. Grace has a lot of chores, like “cooking, cleaning, washing, fetching water.” This shows what life was like for women in real life. Park describes something similar in the novel. She shows how the character Nya’s life was also full of chores. “To the pond and back . . .” she writes, “nearly a full day of walking altogether. This was Nya’s daily routine. . . . Daily. Every single day” (20). Park clearly based her novel on real people and places.

While Park hasn’t changed history, she does focus her attention differently from Matheson. In her book, Park pays very little attention to “The Lost Girls” of the war. Park does refer to others, besides boys and men, being on the journey and at the camps. For example, Park writes, “There were families who managed to escape together, but again, as in Ethiopia, most of the refugees were orphaned boys and young men” (84). However, there are no descriptions of the specific challenges faced by “Lost Girls” in the novel. In contrast, Matheson focuses on the “Lost Girls.” She describes how girls were made to be “unpaid servant\[s\].” They were also placed with guardians who were “supposed to protect them.” Instead these people sold them off as brides for a good price. Matheson also describes how girls were not given the same chance as the boys to live in the United States. This is a focus of Matheson’s text. But Park makes no mention of these challenges for the “Lost Girls.”

Park hasn’t changed history, but she does not include much about the “lost girls” in her story. Both texts describe Kakuma and the roles of females in general. But the authors have chosen to focus their attention differently. This could be because the two texts have different purposes. Park was trying to tell Salva’s story in *A Long Walk to Water*. It is not surprising that his story focuses on the “Lost Boys.” In contrast, Matheson wanted to highlight the suffering of the girls. She did this because their story hadn’t been told as much as the story of the “Lost Boys.” She writes, “Few have thought to inquire about the fate of the ‘Lost Girls.’” This is important. The story of the “Lost Girls” has been untold for too long. While Park did a good job of telling Salva’s story, Matheson has given us a missing piece.
