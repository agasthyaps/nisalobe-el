Images of Juba

**Note to Teacher:** After students read chapter 8 of *A Long Walk to Water*, they will pause to examine images of Juba, the city in Southern Sudan that Salva visits on his way to the United States. These pictures offer a different portrayal of the setting of Southern Sudan from Linda Sue Park’s portrayal of the setting. This inquiry allows students to see Sudan and its people as multi-dimensional with diverse experiences.

Display the images so that students can see them. Consider posting them around the room and allowing students to walk around examining them.
