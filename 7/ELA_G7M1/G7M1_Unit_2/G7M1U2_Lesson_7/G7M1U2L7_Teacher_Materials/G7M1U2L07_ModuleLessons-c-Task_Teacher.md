The Second Sudanese Civil War was a tragedy for millions. Thousands of boys fled the fighting and walked through three countries searching for safety. They were called the “Lost Boys.” Their story is unforgettable and has been told many ways. *A Long Walk to Water*, a novel by Linda Sue Park, tells the story of Salva. In the author’s note, Park explains, “some of the details in this story have been fictionalized, but the major events depicted are based on Salva’s own experiences.” John Deng Langbany’s article “One Day I Had to Run” is about a similar journey. His article is nonfiction. Comparing the two texts shows how Park used historical events in the novel. Many of the same major events are described in both texts. However, the authors focus their attention differently in the two accounts.

The novel and Langbany’s article discuss similar events. For example, both texts describe the journey from Sudan to the United States. Both also describe the walk from Sudan to the first refugee camp in Ethiopia. In chapters 1–11 of *A Long Walk to Water*, Salva describes the horrors of the long journey in detail. He includes hunger, thirst, and people dying. Langbany also describes “a very hard journey” across the desert to Ethiopia. Both texts also discuss how they were treated at Kakuma. In *A Long Walk to Water*, Salva says that the local people “would often sneak in and steal from the refugees” (84). Similarly, Langbany recalls that, “the native people treated us badly because they didn’t know us.” Park clearly based her novel on real events.

While Park hasn’t changed history, she does focus her attention differently from Langbany. For example, most of *A Long Walk to Water* describes the journey from Sudan to Ethiopia. Only chapter 13 is about the journey from Ethiopia to Kenya. However, Langbany focuses nearly half of his article on this part of the journey. Another difference is the description of when the boys are forced to swim the Gilo River. In *A Long Walk to Water*, Salva describes the current and the crocodiles as the most serious threats they faced. In contrast, Langbany focuses on the threat of being shot. The events are the same. But the dangers are described differently. Park focuses on how harsh nature can be. Langbany focuses on the danger from humans.

W.7.2c: Use of the word “while” shows a reference and connection back to something outlined previously.

W.7.2f: The beginning of the conclusion restates the focus of the essay. The rest of the conclusion reflects on the possible reasons for the differences in focus of the two authors.

Main idea: Park uses history but with a different focus than the article.

Although the article and the novel focus on different parts of the journey, they discuss similar events. There are probably many reasons for the differences in focus. One reason may be that Langbany and Salva were different ages during the time described. This means that they had different views. Even if they went through the same events, they would have experienced them differently. Regardless, it is clear that Park found meaning in historical events. In her novel, she uses the experiences of real people like Salva to offer an inspiring message of hope and perseverance.
