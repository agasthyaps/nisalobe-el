Language Dive Guide: Compare and Contrast Model Essay, Transitions

W.7.2c

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

**Similarly,** Langbany recalls that, “the native people treated us badly because they didn’t know us.” (from the second paragraph of the Compare and Contrast Model Essay)

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the Daily Learning Target (I can revise my essay to use appropriate transitions among ideas.) and W.7.2c by providing an example of an effective transition students can use in their own writing.

- Guiding Question: The sentence helps students respond to the guiding question (Who are the Lost Children of Sudan, and what is their story?) by highlighting information about the Lost Children’s experience.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses the transitional word **similarly**, with the purpose of comparing the information in this sentence with the information in the previous sentence(s). It also uses **that** to link the clause “the native people treated us badly because they didn’t know us” to the previous clause. Invite students to discuss each chunk briefly, but encourage extended conversation and practice with the focus structure: **Similarly,**. Based on students’ need and time, consider adding days for extended conversation and practice with a new focus structure: **that, “the native people treated us badly**. Consider asking students “What if we remove **that**?” (The sentence would make sense, but we can use **that** to link the two clauses.)

- Practice and Transfer: After discussing the focus structure, students practice using it to discuss something in their lives. Students transfer their understanding of the meaning and structure of this sentence when transitioning among ideas in their Compare and Contrast Essays in this lesson, as well as during the End of Unit 2 Assessment.

Deconstruct

- Invite students to put their finger by this sentence from the Compare and Contrast Model Essay on their note-catchers: **<u>Similarly,</u> Langbany recalls that, “the native people treated us badly because they didn’t know us.”**

- Read aloud the sentence twice, and then ask students to take turns reading the sentence aloud with their partners.

- Say:

“What does this sentence mean to you?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“How does this sentence add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

Similarly,

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Display and read aloud the following sentence chunk strip: **Similarly,**

- Underline Similarly, in green, and invite students to do the same on their Language Dive: Compare and Contrast Model Essay, Transitions note-catcher. 🖉

- Say:

“What do we think the word similarly means? Is there a familiar word or affix in this word that helps us understand its meaning?” (Similar means almost the same or alike. The suffix -ly tells us similarly is an adverb, which can modify a verb, an adjective, another adverb or a whole sentence.)

- Say:

“Why do you think the author used similarly at the beginning of this sentence? What does it tell us about the next part of the sentence?” (The author used similarly at the beginning of the sentence to let us know it will modify the entire sentence. Similarly tells us the information in this sentence will have something in common with the information in the previous sentence\[s\]; the author is comparing the information in this sentence with the information in the sentence\[s\] that comes before.)

- Invite students to take 30 seconds in pairs to discuss the idea presented in the previous sentence (“In *A Long Walk to Water*, Salva says that the local people ‘would often sneak in and steal from the refugees’”) and then predict what information might be presented in this sentence. (Responses will vary, but may include that the article by Langbany also presents information about local people being cruel to the refugees, the “Lost Children” of Sudan.)

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Display the sentence frame:

**The sky is very blue. Similarly, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is very blue.**

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use this frame to talk about something that is also very blue with your partners.”

Langbany recalls

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **Langbany recalls**

- Say:

“Who is this chunk about?” (Langbany, the author of the article “One Day I Had to Run.”)

“What does this chunk tell us about Langbany?” (That he recalls something)

“What do we think the word recalls means? Is there a familiar word or affix in this word that helps us understand its meaning?” (The prefix re- indicates repetition and tells us something is happening again. Recall means to remember a particular event or situation from the past, to think about it again.)

- Invite students to discuss in pairs what they think Langbany recalls. Remind students of what they discussed in the first chunk, about information that will be similar to the previous sentence: “In *A Long Walk to Water*, Salva says that the local people ‘would often sneak in and steal from the refugees.’”

that, “the native people treated us badly

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **that, “the native people treated us badly**

- Say:

“What does Langbany recall?” (That the native people treated them badly. The native people refers to the local people from Kakuma. We know because the sentence before the previous one states: “Both texts also discuss how they were treated at Kakuma.”)

“Why does the author use quotation marks?” (The quotation marks signal that the author is directly citing the words of someone else. The words that follow the quotation marks are the exact works that Langbany wrote in his article “One Day I Had to Run.”)

“What does the word us tell us about Langbany?” (That Langbany was one of the people who was treated badly; that he is remembering a real experience from his own life, as well as the experience of other refugees.)

“What if we remove the word that in this chunk? How does that change the meaning?” (Removing the word that would not change the meaning. You could remove that and the sentence would still make sense. However, the word that links the clause the native people treated us badly to recalls.)

- Cover the word **that** with your hand and invite students to read aloud the first three chunks without the word **that**, demonstrating how the meaning stays the same.

“How is what Langbany recalls similar to the previous sentence?” (Both sentences tell us about how the refugees were treated badly by the local people in Kakuma.)

because they didn’t know us.”

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **because they didn’t know us.”**

- Underline because in green, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 🖉

- Say:

“What does the word because tell us?” (Because is used when giving the reason for something; it tells us we will find out the reason the native people treated Langbany and the other refugees badly.)

“What is the reason the native people treated them badly?” (They didn’t know them.)

- Invite students to take 30 seconds to discuss in pairs how the local people could have gotten to know the refugees better.

Similarly, Langbany recalls that, “the native people treated us badly because they didn’t know us.”

Reconstruct

- Point to and read aloud the entire sentence on display: **<u>Similarly,</u> Langbany recalls that, “the native people treated us badly because they didn’t know us.”**

“What if we replace similarly in this chunk with on the other hand? How does that change the meaning?” (Replacing the word similarly with on the other hand would mean the information in this sentence is different, or unlike, the information in the previous sentence\[s\]. It would tell us the author is contrasting information in this sentence with the sentence\[s\] that come\[s\] before.)

“What is another way to say this sentence?” (Responses will vary, but may include, “Like Park, Langbany remembers how the local people of Kakuma treated the refugees poorly because they didn’t know them.”)

- Remind students of the habits of character the Lost Children used to survive and to help one another survive, such as respect, empathy, integrity and perseverance. Then, invite them to discuss in pairs how the treatment from the native people in Kakuma might have strengthened their habits of character. (Responses will vary, but may include the Lost Children showing even more perseverance and empathy towards others after encountering such hardships.)

- If productive, cue students to expand the conversation by giving an example:

“Can you give an example?” (Responses will vary.)

- After inviting responses, write and display student ideas.

- Say:

“What other questions can we ask that will help us understand this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses will vary.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, Langbany recalls that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

**Likewise, Comparably** adverb, + independent clause

- Invite students to complete the sentence frame by replacing *similarly* with another adverb that means the same thing. Consider providing a word bank of adverbs for students to choose from.

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use this frame to say this sentence in your own words with your partners.”

- Then, invite students to create a list of other transition words they can use in their writing, adding this list to their note-catcher. 🖉
