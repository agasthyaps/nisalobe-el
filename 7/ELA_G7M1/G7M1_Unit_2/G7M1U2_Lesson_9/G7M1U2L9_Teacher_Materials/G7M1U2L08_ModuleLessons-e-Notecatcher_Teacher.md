<p><strong>The author describes Salva traveling to America as “too excited to sleep” (91). He is also nervous and uncertain. He is given new clothes and meets his new family and “feels his shoulders relax” when he sees their smiles (95).</strong></p></td>
<td><p>How “The ‘Lost Girls’ of Sudan” treats it (if at all):</p>
<p><strong>The article describes how the girls were not able to go to America. Grace says: “Why not the girls?... I would have liked the chance to go abroad. You can be free there. Free to work, free to study.”</strong></p></td>

<td colspan="2"><p>Reflect: How did Linda Sue Park use or alter history in her fictional novel?</p>
<p><strong>Park tells the exciting story of Salva coming to America but does not mention the girls that were left behind, whom the article talks about. The author of the article writes, “The bitter irony of the ‘Lost Boys’ good life in America is not lost on her,” which shows that the girls are aware of how the Lost Boys got to leave while they were forced to stay.</strong></p></td>

<p><strong>Nya is forced to fetch water. “To the pond and back—to the pond and back—nearly a full day of walking altogether<br />

<p><strong>Only the boys are allowed to go to school. “His two sisters, Akit and Agnath, did not go to school. Like the other girls in the village, they stayed home and learned from their mother how to keep house” (2–3).</strong></p></td>

<tr class="odd">
<td colspan="2"><p>Reflect: How did Linda Sue Park use or alter history in her fictional novel?</p>
<p><strong>Like the article’s author, Park shows how women are forced into certain kinds of roles and are expected to do chores rather than go to school. The author of the informational text shows this by describing the lives of the women living at Kakuma, and Park describes Nya’s life as well as how Salva’s sisters and other women lived.</strong></p></td>

<p><strong>This shows that while Park told an important and interesting story about the Lost Boys, she doesn’t talk about the Lost Girls, who also suffered. The article is important for showing their problem as well. As the author writes, “But the fact remains ladies were there.”</strong></p></td>
