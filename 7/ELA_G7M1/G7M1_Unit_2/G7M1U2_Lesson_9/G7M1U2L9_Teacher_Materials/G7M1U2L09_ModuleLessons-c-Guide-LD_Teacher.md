Language Dive Guide: Compare and Contrast Model Essay, Paragraph 1, Focus Statement

W.7.2a, L.7.1a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

**Comparing the two texts** shows how Park used historical events in the novel. (from Unit 2 Model Compare and Contrast Essay)

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the Daily Learning Target (I can plan the introduction of a compare and contrast essay with a strong focus statement.) and W.7.2.a by providing students with model language structures for comparing and contrasting ideas and information in their own writing.

- Supporting Standards: RL.7.9, L.7.1a

- Guiding Question: The sentence helps students respond to the guiding question (Who are the Lost Children of Sudan, and what is their story?) by comparing two texts written about the Lost Children of Sudan.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses a gerund phrase as its subject with the purpose of introducing a comparison of two texts. Invite students to discuss each chunk briefly, but encourage extended conversation and practice with the focus structure: **comparing the two texts.**

- Practice and Transfer: After discussing the focus structure, students practice using it to discuss something in their lives. Students transfer their understanding of the meaning and structure of this sentence when writing their own focus statements, and during the **End of Unit 2 Assessment,** as they write their own compare and contrast essays.

Deconstruct

- Invite students to put their finger by this sentence from the Compare and Contrast Model Essay on their note-catchers: **<u>Comparing the two texts</u> shows how Park used historical events in the novel.**

- Read aloud the sentence twice, and then ask students to take turns reading the sentence aloud with their partners.

- Say:

“What does this sentence mean to you?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“How does this sentence add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

Comparing the two texts

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Display and read aloud the following sentence chunk strip: **comparing the two texts**

- Underline comparing the two texts in blue, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 🖉

- Say:

“Comparing the two texts shows how Park used historical events in the novel.” (from Unit 2 Model Compare and Contrast Essay)

“What does comparing mean?” (showing how things are similar to or alike one another)

“What are the two texts?” (A Long Walk to Water by Linda Sue Park and John Deng Langbany’s article “One Day I Had to Run”)

“Why did we underline this phrase in blue?” (Comparing the two texts is the subject of this sentence; while comparing often acts as a verb, in this sentence it acts as part of a noun phrase. This is called a gerund, where a verb form ends in -ing and acts as a noun.)

“What is another way to say this chunk?” (the act of comparing the two texts; the act of finding similarities between the two texts)

“What does this chunk tell us?” (This chunk tells us the sentence is about comparing the two texts. The rest of the sentence will make a statement about the subject comparing the two texts.)

- If productive, cue students to expand the conversation by giving an example.

- Say:

“Can you give an example from the Compare and Contrast Model Essay of the writer comparing the two texts?” (Responses will vary, but should include an example from the model showing similarities between the two texts.)

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Display the sentence frame:

> **Comparing \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ shows how they both have happy endings.**
>
> (Comparing <u>my favorite movie</u> and <u>my favorite book</u> shows how they both have happy endings.)

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use this frame to talk about comparing two things in your own words with your partners.”

shows how

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **shows how**

- Underline shows how in red, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 🖉

- Say:

“What does this chunk tell us?” (Shows how means to demonstrate or explain the way something is done. This chunk tells us that the act of comparing the two texts demonstrates the way something done.)

What do we think the next chunk will tell us?” (Responses will vary, but may include something that comparing the two texts demonstrates to us.)

Park used historical events in the novel.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **Park used historical events**

- Say:

“Who is Park?” (Park refers to Linda Sue Park, the author of the book A Long Walk to Water.)

“What does this chunk tell us Park did?” (Park used historical events, or real things that happened in the past)

- Underline used historical events in red, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 🖉

- Say:

“What historical events did Park use?” (Responses will vary, but should include accounts of the Lost Boys’ experiences.)

“Where did Park use historical events? (in the novel A Long Walk to Water)

Comparing the two texts shows how Park used historical events in the novel.

Reconstruct

- Point to and read aloud the entire sentence on display: **<u>Comparing the two texts</u> shows how Park used historical events in the novel.**

“What is another way to say this sentence?” (Responses will vary but may include the following: Looking at the similarities between the book A Long Walk to Water and the article “One Day I Had to Run,” it is clear that Park used factual accounts in her book.)

“How did comparing the two texts demonstrate that Park used historical events in her novel?” (The article “One Day I Had to Run” is an informational text that gives factual accounts of people’s experiences during the civil war in Southern Sudan. Because Park’s novel shared similar experiences to this article, it is clear her book is based on historical events.)

“What if we replace comparing in this chunk with the word contrasting? How does that change the meaning?” (Replacing comparing with contrasting would give us the opposite meaning; instead of finding similarities between the two texts, the word contrasting would signal that this sentence is about finding differences between the two texts.)

- After inviting responses, write and display student ideas.

- Say:

“What other questions can we ask that will help us understand this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses will vary.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

> **Comparing Salva and Nya’s story shows how \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**
>
> (Gerund phrase + verb + independent clause.)

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use this frame to compare Salva and Nya’s story in your own words with your partner.”
