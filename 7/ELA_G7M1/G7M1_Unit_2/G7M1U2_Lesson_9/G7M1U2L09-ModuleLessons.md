Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Repeated routines occur in the following:

- W.7.2a – Opening A: The entrance ticket activity reviews the purpose of an introduction and focus statement.

- Opening A: Students review the learning target.

- W.7.2a – Work Time B: In a Language Dive, students explore a sentence from the model essay’s focus statement in order to better understand criteria for an effective essay introduction.

- New skills are introduced in the following:

- RL.7.9 – Work Time A: Students compare and contrast the fictional portrayal of *A Long Walk to Water* with the historical nonfiction account of “The ‘Lost Girls’ of Sudan.”

- W.7.2a – Work Time C: Students plan the introductory paragraph for their compare and contrast essays (including introducing the topic clearly, previewing what is to follow, and organizing ideas).

- W.7.9 – Work Time C: Students determine what evidence from the informational text and novel to include in their introduction paragraph.

- Work Time C: The class adds introduction criteria to the Criteria of an Effective Informative Essay anchor chart.

- W.7.5 – Closing and Assessment A: Students share with a partner to receive peer support on their plans for their introductory paragraph of their compare and contrast essays.

- Closing and Assessment A: Students engage in collaborative discussions about habits of character.

- The Think-Pair-Share protocol is used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Encourage those students who finish planning their introduction earlier than others to go through their Similarities and Differences: *A Long Walk to Water* and “The ‘Lost Girls’ of Sudan” note-catcher to identify the evidence they may use to support their focus statement.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lessons, students analyzed the structure of the model essay using the Painted Essay® template. In this lesson, students analyze in detail the introductory paragraph so they can begin planning their own essays in this lesson. Students also began comparing and contrasting the article and novel in the previous lesson, which is work that they will build upon in this lesson.

Support All Students

- Students may need additional support planning their introductory paragraphs. Group those students for a teacher-led discussion that will guide them to giving context to the reader about the Sudanese Civil War.

- Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this lesson that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually.

- Note there is a differentiated version of Informative Writing Plan Graphic Organizer used in Work Time C in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson explicitly teaches students how to plan an introductory paragraph for a compare and contrast essay. This explicit introduction to writing an opening paragraph is beneficial to ELLs because the academic language necessary for doing this task often has to be learned directly from instruction since it entails academic language and language structures not used in everyday speech.

- ELLs may find using the extensive Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer challenging because it requires students to generate a lot of abstract language in a short amount of time. Therefore, additional supports such as the ones listed below may be useful.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.4, 7.I.B.6, 7.II.A.1, 7.II.A.2, 7.II.B.5, 7.II.C.6, and 7.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- Circulate to monitor students’ evidence gathering on the Similarities and Differences: *A Long Walk to Water* and “The ‘Lost Girls’ of Sudan” note-catcher and their planning skills on the Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer. If necessary, collect either one of these to provide feedback to students who may need it before the following lesson.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will plan the first Proof Paragraph of their essays, drawing on the work they did in planning their introduction and especially their focus statement.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Ensure there is a copy of Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 9 at each student’s workspace.

- Review the Informative Writing checklist to become familiar with what will be required of students over the remainder of the unit.

- Preview the Language Dive Guide, and consider how to invite conversation among students to address the language goals suggested under each sentence chunk strip (see Materials list). Select from the questions and goals provided to best meet students’ needs.

- Post the applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous modules to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.7.2a (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 9**.

- Repeated routine: follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review the learning target and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students if the learning target is similar or the same as in previous lessons.

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique to review their responses. Then use the vocabulary strategies on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart** to deconstruct the words *introduction* (the beginning or opening to an essay or book) and *focus statement* (a sentence that tells the main points of an essay) in the learning target. Record on the **academic word wall** with translations in home languages, where appropriate, and invite students to record words in their **vocabulary logs**.

Work Time

A. Compare and Contrast Texts – RL.7.9 (10 minutes)

- Ask students to retrieve their **Similarities and Differences: *A Long Walk to Water*** **and “The ‘Lost Girls’ of Sudan” note-catchers** and their copies of the texts ***A Long Walk to Water*** and “The ‘Lost Girls’ of Sudan.” Inform students that they will continue the work they did in the previous lesson, finding the similarities and differences in how the authors treat different subjects. Ask students to form pairs or small groups to discuss the events, ideas, and supporting evidence they’ve identified. ▲ Then students can discuss in their groups their plans for evidence-gathering at this stage:

“Do we have to identify more topics to compare or gather more evidence for topics already identified?” (Responses will vary.)

- Once students have a plan for evidence-gathering, release them to complete their note-catchers, finding all the evidence they will need for their compare and contrast essays.

Work Time

B. Language Dive: Focus Statement – W.7.2a (10 minutes)

- Repeated routine: follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to facilitate a Language Dive with the focus statement from the model essay:

“Comparing the two texts shows how Park used historical events in the novel.”

- Use the accompanying materials to facilitate the Language Dive:

- **Language Dive Guide: Compare and Contrast Model Essay, Focus Statement (for teacher reference)**

- **Language Dive: Compare and Contrast Model Essay, Focus Statement sentence chunk strips**

- **Language Dive: Compare and Contrast Model Essay, Focus Statement note-catcher**

- **Language Dive: Compare and Contrast Model Essay, Focus Statement note-catcher (for teacher reference)**

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time B, instead of asking for examples of other focus statements that would address the prompt, provide two other focus statements, of which one addresses the focus statement, and one does not. Have students explain to the class or partners which focus statement does and does not address the prompt, as well as why. This makes the task more concrete, specific, and accessible to ELLs.

For Heavier Support

- **N/A**

Work Time

C. Plan an Introduction – W.7.2a (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target:

“I can plan the introduction of a compare and contrast essay with a strong focus statement.”

- Inform students that they will use the notes they generated on the Similarities and Differences note-catcher as they begin planning their own in essays to the prompt: *How has the author of* *A Long Walk to Water* *used or altered history in the novel?*

- Explain that in this lesson, they are only organizing the information for the introduction in their graphic organizer and will draft the essay for Part I of their end of unit assessment.

- Ask students to retrieve their annotated copies of the **Compare and Contrast Model Essay**, and remind them that this essay was written to the same prompt to which they will write their essays, but that it used a different informational text to compare and contrast with *A Long Walk to Water*.

- Remind students that they will also be comparing and contrasting texts, and that this is one style of an informative essay.

- Invite students to refer to their **Painted Essay® template** to remember the parts of an introductory paragraph and review the general purpose of each part. (Students should draw on their responses to the entrance activity):

- Introduction (background information to provide needed context and engage the reader)

- Focus statement (states the central idea of the essay)

- Invite students to chorally read the introductory paragraph of the model essay as a class, stopping after each sentence to explain its function in the paragraph. ▲ Invite students to help record the criteria of an introductory paragraph on the **Criteria of an Effective Informative Essay anchor chart**. Refer to **Criteria of an Effective Informative Essay anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Focus the class on the following sentence from the model essay:

“The Second Sudanese Civil War was a tragedy for millions.”

- Ask students to discuss with their partners:

“What would the effect be if the sentence were removed from the paragraph?” (The reader wouldn’t understand why Salva and the boys were walking or what the Sudanese Civil War was.)

- Ask for a student volunteer to answer the question:

“What is the best way to summarize the sentences that come before the focus statement in the Model Essay’s introduction?” (The sentences should give the history and context for the Sudanese civil war.)

- Direct students’ attention to the prompt and focus statement for the essay:

- **Prompt:** How has the author of *A Long Walk to Water* used or altered history in the novel?

- **Focus Statement Sentences:** Comparing the two texts shows how Park used historical events in the novel. Many of the same major events are described in both texts. However, the authors focus their attention differently in the two accounts.

- Ask for student volunteers to describe how the prompt and focus statement are related. (The focus statement answers the question in the prompt.)

- Invite students to Think-Pair-Share about the following question:

“What are some of the other ways the focus statement sentences might have been written that would have still answered the prompt?” (“One Day I Had to Run,” about a similar journey by another Lost Boy of Sudan, John Deng Langbany, revealed how much Park altered history in the novel . . . revealed how Park altered only some of history . . . .)

- Refocus whole group. Ask for volunteers to discuss their thinking about the focus statement. Use this discussion to remind students their focus statements are their interpretations based on their understanding of the evidence and how it answers the prompt. They can choose which direction to go in as long as it is supported by the evidence and answers the prompt.

- Move students into predetermined pairs, and invite them to label themselves A and B. Provide differentiated mentors by purposefully preselecting student partnerships, so that these students can work together throughout the planning of their essays. Meet with the mentors in advance to encourage them to share their thought process with their partner. ▲

- Display and distribute the **Informative Writing checklist**. Point out the following characteristic on the checklist:

“W.7.2a: I introduce the topic clearly, giving readers a preview of the piece.”

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“Are there any specific criteria that you should be aware of and list in that column on the checklist?” (Responses will vary.)

- As students share out, capture their responses in the “Characteristics of My Informative Essay” column as needed.

- Display and distribute the **Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer** and the **Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer** ▲ as necessary for students who need extra support. The differentiated graphic organizer supports students’ planning with additional prompts and sentence starters. ▲ Ask for student volunteers to share what they think the phrases “catch the reader’s attention” and “support this focus statement” mean in the organizer.

- Remind students to refer to the academic word wall and **domain-specific word wall** as needed.

- Invite students to use the Compare and Contrast Model Essay, the criteria on the Criteria of an Effective Informative Essay anchor chart, and the Informative Writing checklist to plan an introduction. Instruct students to use the guiding prompts in the introduction table of the Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer. Use the **Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer (example for teacher reference)** to model completing the planner as if writing the model essay, thinking aloud while recording ideas:

“I will catch my reader’s attention by giving a strong statement about the Sudanese Civil War. I need to give my reader the context of the civil war, who the lost children are, and the names and authors of the texts. My focus statement is . . . .”

- Circulate to support students as they plan. Provide students an opportunity to orally test and rehearse their ideas with a partner before recording. This may assist them to organize their thinking.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the learning target.

For Lighter Support

- N/A

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time C, adjust the Informative Writing Plan graphic organizer to meet the needs of students with little experience writing in English. This can be done by eliminating the first two questions in the organizer and emphasizing the last two questions on the focus statement and main points. Carefully, model how to fill out the questions about the focus statement and main points, and if necessary, also provide a list of possible focus statements and main points for students to choose from. Reducing the scope of a task without reducing the purpose of a task sometimes provides ELLs with better access to academically challenging lessons.

Closing and Assessment

A. Pair Share – W.7.5 (5 minutes)

- Invite student pairs to pair up with another pair to share their plans for their introductions and provide feedback against relevant criteria on the Informative Writing checklist. Ask for a volunteer pair to help model this exchange, using prompts such as “How do you plan on catching the reader’s attention?” or “What is your focus statement, and how do you plan on supporting it?”

- Focus students on the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**, and remind them of the habit of character recorded (respect), as students are sharing out their planning work and developing their understanding of the task.

- Invite pairs to begin discussion with each other. Circle and monitor the discussions to ensure students each share their hook, context, and focus statement.

- Incorporate reflection on and awareness of the following academic mindset: “I belong in this community.”

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“How does respect help you feel a sense of belonging in this classroom community?” (Responses will vary. Possible response: When my classmates listen to and support me, I feel like this classroom is a safe place for me.)

For Lighter Support

- Give students a set of three or fewer specific questions to discuss about their plans with partners. Post the questions besides stating them verbally. Specifying and limiting the questions to be discussed, as well as writing them down, makes the task clearer, and therefore more accessible to ELLs.

For Heavier Support

- As a follow-up to the Work Time support, provide students with sentence frames for the partner discussion of focus statements and main points. As always when using sentence frames, model how to use them with specific examples before expecting students to use them themselves independently.

- What is your focus statement?

- My focus statement is . . .

- What are your main points?

- My main points are . . .

- Sentence frames help ELLs better participate in conversations by providing them with the language they need to initiate a comment or respond to a question, freeing them up to focus their attention on generating the language they need for articulating the comment itself or answering the question in depth.

Homework

A. Focus Statements

- Students complete **Homework: Focus Statements** to review and revise their focus statements and to ensure they are answering the prompt.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their independent reading journal.
