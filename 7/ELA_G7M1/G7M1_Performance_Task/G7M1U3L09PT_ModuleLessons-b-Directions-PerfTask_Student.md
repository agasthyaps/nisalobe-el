**Name:** **Date:**

After reading *A Long Walk to Water* and supporting informational material, create an ebook of the narrative you’ve written to tell the story of a Lost Boy or Girl of Sudan. Your narrative will be for third-grade students and will most likely be read aloud by a teacher or by you, the writer. Your narrative should display the habits of character that allowed the Lost Boys and Girls of Sudan to survive their journeys. Use details and examples from your research to develop your narrative, including key events and settings. Clearly organize your narrative by using transitional words and phrases as well as techniques such as dialogue and description to change the pace of the story.

An effective performance task includes

- a cover page with title,

- an informative author’s note describing your research and the habits of character evident in the story you have written,

- a story about a Lost Boy or Girl,

- multimedia like images and software to make an ebook,

- the chance to present to younger students (spread into manageable chunks for third-grade students to understand),

- a cover page with title, and

- thoughtful use of transitions and pacing throughout.
