<p><strong>The author rhymes at the end of every-other line (“fife” and “life”) throughout the poem to draw connections between his memories and how they make him feel.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Laugh and love and watch with wonder-eyes,” (2) — this shows the appreciation the author has for home)</strong></p>
<p><strong>“bathe the brown blades” (6), “delicious tunes” (10) — these phrases help to show the beauty of the author’s home)</strong></p>
<p><strong>“stray melodies . . . dim remembered” (12) — this talks about how the author missing home and his memories are fading and when he returns, his mind will be eased of “long, long years of pain” (14)</strong></p></td>

<td><strong>By describing the environment of home in beautiful ways, repeating the words “return” and “return again” to emphasize the importance of going back. The speaker describes elements of nature, including “sapphire skies” and “bending grasses.” Mentioning the pain of being away also contributes to the theme of returning home to ease one’s mind of “long, long years of pain.”</strong></td>
