<td><p><strong>Structure</strong></p>
<p><strong>How does structure (including rhyme and repetition) contribute to meaning?</strong></p>
<p><strong>The author begins the poem by repeating the same phrase, and this phrase also comes throughout the poem. Repeating the line helps the author state his wish to “return” and then give reasons why.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The author rhymes at the end of every-other line (“fife” and “life”) throughout the poem to draw connections between his memories and how they make him feel.</strong></p></td>
<td><p><strong>Language</strong></p>
<p><strong>How does the language (including word choice and figurative language) in the poem influence meaning?</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Laugh and love and watch with wonder-eyes” (this shows the appreciation the author has for home); “bathe the brown blades,” “delicious tunes” (these phrases help to show the beauty of the author’s home); “stray melodies . . . dim remembered” (this talks about the author missing home and how his memories are fading)</strong></p></td>

<tr class="even">
<td colspan="2"><p><strong>Theme</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is a theme of this poem?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Home holds a special meaning for people; memories are important; returning home can be joyful because his mind will be eased of “long, long years of pain.”</strong></p></td>

| **African Phantasy: Awakening**               | ***African Phantasy: Awakening* seems to connect because it features elements of nature and what looks like people dancing or celebrating in nature. This shows the importance of nature, just as the poem does. Also, since Africa can represent a kind of homeland, the two pieces show a connection and celebration of the homeland.** |
