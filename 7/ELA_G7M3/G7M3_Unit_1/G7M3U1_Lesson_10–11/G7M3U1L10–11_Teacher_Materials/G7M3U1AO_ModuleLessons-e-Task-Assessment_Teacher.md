Answers will vary, but may include: The speaker of “I Shall Return” by Claude McKay expresses his desire to “return,” most likely to his home. A theme of the poem is that home holds a special meaning for people. The author develops the theme by structuring each stanza as a list of things he wishes to see on returning home. The author also uses figurative language such as “sapphire skies” and “delicious tunes” to show how much the speaker misses home. The author rhymes at the end of every-other line (“fife” and “life”) throughout the poem to draw connections between his memories and how they make him feel. Finally, the author ends the poem by stating that the speaker is going home  
“to ease my mind of long, long years of pain.” This shows how home can hold a special meaning for people.
