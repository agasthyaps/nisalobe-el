Interactive Flowchart Directions

RI.7.3, SL.7.1, L.7.4

1.  Choose an Interactive Flowchart card. Read the card aloud (e.g., Dr. Josephine Baker tracked down Mary and found she was still working as a cook.).

<!-- -->

1.  Using an arrow card, connect this card to another Interactive Flowchart card (e.g., The idea of a healthy carrier was still “brand new and frightening.”).

2.  Read the second card aloud.

3.  Explain why the two Interactive Flowchart cards belong together, how one influences the other (e.g., Mary kept working as a cook because she didn’t think she could be a healthy carrier. Being a healthy carrier was a new idea at that time.).

4.  Another member of the group takes a turn by either

- adding a new arrow and another card anywhere on the “flowchart”

- verbally explaining a new connection between any of the cards already connected on the table

- writing an event, action of a key individual, or an idea from the text on an index card and then using an arrow to add it to the flowchart.

5.  Take turns using the remaining Interactive Flowchart cards and continuing to explain the connections between them.

6.  The activity ends when time is up or when all cards have been used and group members have explained all the connections they see.
