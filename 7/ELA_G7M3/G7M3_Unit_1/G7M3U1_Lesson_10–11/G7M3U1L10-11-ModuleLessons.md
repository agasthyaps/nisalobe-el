Lesson Overview

Lesson Summary

Students complete their end of unit assessment by answering selected and constructed response questions to analyze the structure, language, and theme of the poem “I Shall Return.” Then students synthesize their analysis by completing a note-catcher in preparation for the discussion in the following lesson. Lastly, students analyze two artworks for theme and add these and all other works from Unit 1 to the class museum collection.

Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- L.7.4 – Opening A: On an entrance ticket, students determine or clarify the meaning of unknown words from the poem “I Shall Return.”

- RL.7.4 – Work Time B: Students track their progress on determining the meaning of words and phrases, especially figurative language.

- RL.7.2 – Work Time C: Students synthesize their analysis of “I Shall Return,” determining the impact of figurative language, rhyme, and repetition on the development of theme.

- RL.7.2 – Closing and Assessment A: Students examine two artworks and analyze the techniques artists use and their effect on developing meaning in the works.

- RL.7.2 – Closing and Assessment B: Students collaborate to add all the works they’ve read in this unit to the museum collection, discussing connections among the works, especially by theme.

- For the end of unit assessment in Work Time A of this lesson, students read the poem “I Shall Return” and answer selected and constructed response questions to analyze how figurative language and structure contribute to meaning and the development of themes. (RL.7.1, RL.7.2, RL.7.4, RL.7.5, RL.7.10, L.7.5c, L.7.6)

- In this lesson, students focus on becoming effective learners by practicing integrity and perseverance as they independently read and answer questions for the end of unit assessment.

- The Think-Pair-Share and Interactive Flowchart protocol are used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- Two lessons have been allocated for this assessment to ensure sufficient time for students to analyze form, language, and theme: “I Shall Return.” If these are taught in two separate lessons rather than together as one block, revisit the learning targets and the task at the beginning of the second 45-minute lesson to remind students of the task and purpose.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release more responsibility more quickly to students as they comprehend the tasks or concepts. For example:

- Encourage those students who finish the assessment early to begin tracking their progress.

- Allow students to create their own note-catcher, as this is a skill they will need for high school, college, and even in careers. Challenge students to read the learning targets and then determine how they would take notes about how poems develop meaning (themes) through figurative language and structure.

- If students would like to add images, biographies, and other accompanying texts of artists and writers to the museum collection, invite them to research this and print images and texts to add to the collection.

- In Closing and Assessment A, students may have experience analyzing artwork. Invite these students to model how to interpret a sculpture and painting, or ask them to lead a discussion on what the sculpture or painting shows and what the details in the sculpture might mean with regard to theme.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students have focused on analyzing the structure, language, and theme of poetry and artwork from the Harlem Renaissance. In this lesson, they draw on this practice to analyze a poem from the Harlem Renaissance independently.

Support All Students

- Continue to monitor students to determine if issues surface from the content of this poem that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually.

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment. ▲

- For some students, this assessment may require more than the 30 minutes allotted. Provide time over multiple days if necessary. ▲

- The subject matter in this poem includes mention of the speaker’s “long, long years of pain.” Continue to monitor students to determine if issues surface from the content of this poem that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually. To support students in processing this content, ask: “What habit of character did you use as you read and discussed this poem?” Students may need to draw on perseverance, empathy, and compassion as they read and discuss this content, being sensitive to their own and others’ reactions to the information.

- To support ELLs, the assessment in this lesson consists of tasks and questions in the same format as the activities students have completed throughout the unit thus far. This gradual release supports students in independent achievement on this assessment.

- ELLs may find it challenging to interpret the poem. Remind students to reread the poem several times. They can highlight familiar and unfamiliar key words, using strategies to define the unfamiliar words. Finally, students can illustrate the poem in the margins to record their comprehension of the images. For the constructed response paragraph, encourage students to try to recall sentence frames they have been given throughout the unit for similar responses.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.A.3, 7.I.B.5, 7.I.B.6, 7.I.B.8, 7.I.C.10, 7.I.C.12, and 7.II.A.1.

Assessment Guidance

- All assessment Materials (student prompt and teacher checklist) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback on this assessment, use the answer key and sample student responses (see Assessment Overview and Resources) to help complete students’ Track Progress recording form.

- In this assessment, students are tracking progress toward anchor standard:

- R.1: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.

- R.4: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Interpret words and phrases as they are used in a text, including determining technical, connotative, and figurative meanings, and analyze how specific word choices shape meaning or tone.

- R.10: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Read and comprehend complex literary and informational texts independently and proficiently.

- L.4: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Determine or clarify the meaning of unknown and multiple-meaning words and phrases by using context clues, analyzing meaningful word parts, and consulting general and specialized reference materials, as appropriate.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will have a collaborative discussion on the structure, language, and theme of the poem and artwork analyzed in this lesson as well as the poems analyzed in previous lessons.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.7.4 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lessons 10–11**.

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique to review their responses. Add *wafting*, *loiter*, *sapphire*, *fiddle*, *fife*, and *runes* to the **academic** and **domain-specific word walls** and invite students to add the words to their **vocabulary logs**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Opening

B. Review End of Unit 3 Assessment (5 minutes)

- Return students’ **Module 3 Mid-Unit 1 Assessments with feedback** and allow students time to review feedback and write their name on the board if they require support.

Work Time

A. End of Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Structure, Language, and Theme: “I Shall Return” (30 minutes)

- Review appropriate learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze how the structure of ‘I Shall Return’ contributes to its meaning.”

“I can determine the meaning of figurative language in ‘I Shall Return.’”

“I can identify a theme and explain how it is developed over the course of ‘I Shall Return.’”

- Distribute **End of Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Form, Language, and Theme: “I Shall Return.”** Tell students that for this assessment, they will read the poem **“I Shall Return”** and analyze its figurative language and structure by answering selected response questions. Then they will describe what the poem is about, including its theme, in a constructed response question.

- Read aloud the directions for each part of the assessment as students follow along. Answer clarifying questions.

- Before students begin the assessment, ask them to Think-Pair-Share:

“What value does the task of a reading assessment have for you beyond this class? Why?” (Responses will vary. Possible response: This task has a lot of value for me because I will have to take reading assessments and analyze poetry in many of my high school and college classes.)

“What will help you succeed on this assessment?” (Responses will vary. Possible response: Using my strategies to answer selected response questions and writing a paragraph with a topic sentence, at least two pieces of evidence, and a concluding statement will help me succeed with this task.)

- Direct students’ attention to the following materials:

- Academic and domain-specific word walls

- **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart**

- **Strategies to Answer Selected Response Questions anchor chart**

- Vocabulary log

- **Print or online dictionaries**

- Remind students to refer to these materials as they read the assessment text and answer the assessment questions.

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence. Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart** and review perseverance, taking initiative, and taking responsibility. Remind students that because they will be reading and answering questions independently for the assessment, they will need to practice these habits.

- Invite students to begin the assessment.

- While they are taking the assessment, circulate to monitor and document their test-taking skills.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- Before the end of unit assessment in Work Time A, challenge students to underline key vocabulary in the assessment directions and writing prompt as they are read aloud together as a class. Invite students who need lighter support to restate or clarify information for students who need heavier support. These supports ensure that students understand each task included in the assessment.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time A, read the directions for the assessment slowly, twice and post them. This ensures that ELLs who may not be able to easily follow the language of the directions have multiple opportunities to access them.

- Display a “map” of the assessment to reference while explaining directions to the end of unit assessment. This will reduce ambiguity and give students a clearer picture of what they can expect so that they can better allocate their time and attentional resources. Provide students with colored pencils or highlighters so that they can mark up the map as needed. Example:

- Read the poem several times. Whisper read it aloud as well.

- Read each question and each possible answer.

- Cross out incorrect answers.

- Select the best answer to the question.

- Repeat steps 2–4 for questions 1–6.

- Read the prompt for question 7.

- Write a paragraph with

1.  a topic sentence that restates and answers the prompt.

2.  two pieces of evidence (quotes or examples) from the text.

3.  sentences that explain how the evidence supports the answer.

4.  a concluding sentence that restates and answers the prompt.

- To help students manage their time during the end of unit assessment, display on the board or on a poster suggested times when students move on to the next question. Allocate the most time to question 7, the constructed response.

Work Time

B. Track Progress – RL.7.4 (10 minutes)

- Give students specific, positive feedback on their completion of the End of Unit 1 Assessment.

- Distribute the **Track Progress folders**, **Track Progress: Read, Understand, and Explain New Text**, and several blank **sticky notes** to each student.

- Focus students on the Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart. Remind students that they will take responsibility for their own learning as they track their progress.

- Tell students the sticky notes are for them to find evidence in their assessment work of the following criteria:

- RL.7.1

- RL.7.4, L.7.4

- Guide students through completing the recording form.

- Incorporate reflection on and awareness of the following academic mindsets: “I can succeed at this” and “My ability and competence grow with my effort.”

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What helped you to be successful at that assessment? How much effort did you put into this assessment? How did your effort affect your learning?” (Possible response: I was successful at the assessment because I focused and worked hard. I also understood what I was doing and what was being asked of me, which helped me succeed as well. Working hard in the lessons leading up to the assessment helped me succeed today.)

Work Time

C. Synthesize Analysis of “I Shall Return” – RL.7.2 (10 minutes)

- Review appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze how the structure of ‘I Shall Return’ contributes to its meaning.”

“I can determine the meaning of figurative language in ‘I Shall Return.’”

“I can identify a theme and explain how it is developed over the course of ‘I Shall Return.’”

- Distribute the **Analyze Poetry: “I Shall Return” note-catcher**. Inform students that this note-catcher will support them to analyze its figurative language, structure, and theme. Additionally, this note-catcher highlights the collaboration between artists and writers at the time, as connections are noted between poetry and artwork.

- Invite students to reread the poem “I Shall Return.” Remind students that given the fact that they have just completed an end of unit assessment on this poem and recorded their ideas about other poems using a similar note-catcher, this material should feel relatively comfortable. Explain that this step is an important one to prepare them for the next lesson’s collaborative discussion. Coming to a discussion prepared means taking the time to write down ideas about the poetry and artwork.

- Note that students will not complete the theme paragraph as they have already done so on the assessment. Also, they will complete the connections chart in the following activity.

- As students complete the note-catcher independently or in pairs, display the **Harlem Renaissance Themes anchor chart**. Once students have completed their note-catchers, use a total participation technique so that students can share their responses. Record these on the anchor chart. For possible responses, see the **Analyze Poetry: “I Shall Return” note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** and the **Harlem Renaissance Themes anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time C, encourage students to use the Analyze Poetry note-catcher ▲ from Lesson 7, which is a generic note-catcher that students can use throughout this unit. This resource supports student writing and comprehension with sentence frames.

Closing and Assessment

A. Analyze Visual Art – RL.7.2 (20 minutes)

- Inform students that they will look at two pieces of artwork and analyze them for technique and theme.

- Display and distribute the **image of Meta Warrick Fuller’s *Ethiopia Awakening*** **sculpture**. Invite students to Think-Pair-Share:

“Describe the sculpture. What do you see? What is happening? What do you wonder about this artwork?” (A woman in Egyptian or African-type clothing that looks like mummy wrappings around her legs is standing with one hand on her heart; she is turning her head, looking off into the distance.)

- If students need more support in describing the sculpture, ask:

“What type of clothing is the figure wearing?” (Egyptian or African-type clothing, mummy-type wrappings around her legs.)

“What is the figure doing with her hands? What impression or feeling does the figure’s pose give?” (One hand is across her chest, the other down by her side. She is turning her head to the side and looks as if she is thinking about something or sighing or posing elegantly. Her pose gives the feeling of satisfaction or confidence.)

- Tell students that the name of this statue is *Ethiopia Awakening*. Ask students if they are familiar with the country of Ethiopia, and where it is located. (Ethiopia is located in Africa.) Ask students what the word *Awakening* suggests in the title. (*Awakening* suggests waking up from sleep or perhaps from the past.)

- Explain to students that when Fuller made this statue, Ethiopia was one of the only countries in Africa not controlled by a European country, so it stood as a symbol of independence.

“How does the name of the sculpture help you figure out what its meaning?” (“Ethiopia” connects to the features, such as the headpiece and the clothing, which suggest a connection to the ancient past. “Awakening” connects to her emerging and rising from this past.)

- If necessary, explain to students how the headpiece and clothing suggest a connection to the past.

- Record student responses in the first column of the Harlem Renaissance Themes anchor chart. Consult the Harlem Renaissance Themes anchor chart (example for teacher reference) as necessary.

“What theme does the sculpture convey?” (The sculpture shows that people rely on their histories and ancestors to rise up and gather strength.)

- Record student responses in the second column of the Harlem Renaissance Themes anchor chart. Consult that anchor chart (example for teacher reference) as necessary.

- Share the following quote from the artist with students, explaining that Meta Warrick Fuller is speaking about African Americans in this quote:

“Here was a group who had once made history and now after a long sleep was awaking, gradually unwinding the bandage of its mummied past and looking out on life again, expectant but unafraid and with at least a graceful gesture.”

- Ask students to carefully examine the sculpture in light of the quote. Have them Think-Pair-Share:

“How does the half mummy, half non-mummy aspect of this sculpture add to or change the theme?” (The mummy signifies the history and ancestry. The fact that the woman has only half her body in mummy wrappings suggests that she is rising up and emerging from her history and ancestry shows how she gathers strength from her roots.)

- Record student responses in the third and fourth columns of the Harlem Renaissance Themes anchor chart. Consult the Harlem Renaissance Themes anchor chart (example for teacher reference) as necessary.

- If students need support identifying a theme, ask:

“How does this sculpture connect to Claude McKay’s poem?” (McKay’s poem is about returning to one’s roots, and Fuller’s sculpture is about using one’s roots to rise up.)▲

- Instruct students to add this connection to the last row of their Analyze Poetry: “I Shall Return” note-catchers.

- Now display an **online image of** **Winold Reiss’ *African Phantasy: Awakening***.

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“Describe the painting. What do you see? What is happening? What do you wonder about this artwork?” (Two figures are dancing, and one appears to be praying. They are surrounded by images of nature.)

- If students need more support in describing the painting, ask:

“What are the figures doing?” (Dancing and praying.)▲

“What do you notice on the ground?” (Flowers and clouds.)▲

“What do you see in the background?” (More people, perhaps ghosts or a memory from the past. Clouds, sunshine, mountains, and water, as well as people bowing down at the base of a tree.)▲

- Record student responses in the first column of the Harlem Renaissance Themes anchor chart. Consult the Harlem Renaissance Themes anchor chart (example for teacher reference) as necessary.

- Inform students that the painting is called *African Phantasy: Awakening*. Ask students what familiar word *phantasy* looks and sounds like and what that word means. (*Phantasy* looks and sounds like *fantasy*, which means something imagined or wished for.) Confirm for students that *phantasy* is an older spelling of the word *fantasy* and means something similar.

“How does the name of the painting help you figure out what it is about?” (The word *African* connects to the images of the figures. The word phantasy connects to imagination and something dreamlike. The picture looks like a dream or something imagined because the figures seem to be in the clouds, and there are many different images layered on top of each other as in a dream. The word *awakening* connects to the idea of emerging and rising from this history.)

“What theme does the painting convey?” (The painting shows that shared history and connection to nature helps people rise up and gather strength.)

“How does the painting develop this theme?” (The painting shows people dancing and praying in nature, suggesting that they are gathering strength or celebrating the world around them. The name of the painting indicates that the figures and the land are African, suggesting that the figures or artist and viewer are waking up from a dream of Africa, which adds to the theme the idea of connecting to a homeland.)

- Record student responses in the second through fourth columns of the Harlem Renaissance Themes anchor chart. Consult the Harlem Renaissance Themes anchor chart (example for teacher reference) as necessary.

“How does this painting connect with Claude McKay’s poem and Meta Warrick Fuller’s sculpture?” (They’re all about gaining strength and wisdom from our past.)

- Instruct students to add this connection to the Making Connections section of their Analyze Poetry: “I Shall Return” note-catchers.

- Display the **Techniques anchor chart** and ask students to discuss the techniques of art they saw in *Ethiopia Awakening* and *African Phantasy: Awakening*. Ask:

“What techniques did the artists use in these pieces?” (Possible responses: movement and position of figures; use of light and color.)

- Add “use of color” to the anchor chart. Consult the **Techniques anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- For Closing and Assessment A, form strategic partnerships to support students to analyze the artwork. Students may benefit from working in home-language or multilevel partnerships so they have support to understand the questions and are able to respond during pair and class discussions.

Closing and Assessment

B. Add to Museum Collection – RL.7.2 (10 minutes)

- Inform students that they will now add “I Shall Return,” *Ethiopia Awakening*, *African Phantasy*, “Calling Dreams,” “Hope,” and “The Negro Speaks of Rivers” to the classroom museum collection, which already contains *Shuffle Along* and “Lift Every Voice.” Ask students to retrieve their copies of these texts and works. As necessary, remind students that at the beginning of the module they set aside this space to collect all the works that they will study from the Harlem Renaissance.

- Explain to students that before they add these additional works to the museum collection, they will discuss how the works interact with each other either in terms of structure, language, and theme.

- Ask students to form triads. Distribute the **Interactive Flowchart directions** to each triad and read aloud the steps. Remind students that they have participated in this protocol before, during Module 2. Model how to complete the activity.

- Place the **Interactive Flowchart cards and arrows** on the board using magnets, tape, or technology. Leave space between the cards.

- Model and review the Interactive Flowchart activity directions:

- Choose an Interactive Flowchart card. Read the card aloud (e.g., “The Negro Speaks of Rivers”).

- Using an arrow card, connect this card to another Interactive Flowchart card by form, language and/or theme, (e.g., “I Shall Return”).

- Read the second card aloud.

- Explain why the two Interactive Flowchart cards belong together and how one is similar to the other in structure, language, and/or theme (e.g., “The Negro Speaks of Rivers” is connected to “I Shall Return” by the theme of the connection to nature and one’s past. In “The Negro Speaks of Rivers,” the speaker tells of being connected to all the ancient rivers that his African and African American ancestors worked and lived near, showing his connection to nature and his past. In “I Shall Return,” the speaker tells of wanting to go back home where there are “sapphire skies” and “bending grasses,” which shows his connection to a past home and to natural beauty.)

- Another member of the group takes a turn by doing one of the following:

<!-- -->

- Adding a new arrow and another card anywhere on the flowchart.

- Explaining a new connection between any of the cards already connected on the table.

- Writing an element of structure (form, repetition, rhyme), an element of language (figurative, connotative), or a theme from the poetry or artwork on an index card and then using an arrow to add it to the flowchart.

<!-- -->

- Take turns using the remaining Interactive Flowchart cards and continuing to explain the connections between them.

- The activity ends when time is up or when all cards have been used and group members have explained all the connections they see.

- Invite students to create the Interactive Flowchart in triads. Once students complete their flowcharts, ask volunteers to share with the class one new connection they made. Ask:

“How do the poetry, songs, script, and artwork connect with one another?” (Much of the writing and art is about returning to or celebrating home, Africa, and ancestors. The artists collaborating on *Shuffle Along* helped to bring African American actors, musicians, and audiences to Broadway, and showed that it was possible for art by African Americans to achieve great popularity.)

“What connections can you make in form or structure?” (“I Shall Return,” “Calling Dreams,” and “Hope” all have a rhyming pattern. “I Shall Return” rhymes every other line, except for the last two lines, which are a rhyming couplet. “Calling Dreams” and “Hope” rhyme in couplets.)

“What connections can you make in the use of language?” (Both use figurative language. In “The Negro Speaks of Rivers,” Langston Hughes compares his soul to a river: “My soul has grown deep.” In “I Shall Return” Claude McKay compares music to something you might eat: “delicious tunes.”)

“What connections can you make in theme?” (The artworks develop the theme of finding a connection with one’s past. Both *African Phantasy: Awakening and Ethiopia Awakening* show figures from the ancient past showing strong emotions. In this way, they are like the poems, which are trying to communicate the emotions that come with thinking about the past. Also, both pieces have *awakening* and *Africa* in their titles, suggesting that the artists or the people in the art are waking up in or to Africa or the idea of Africa—just like the speakers in the poems are connecting to Africa or home. *African Phantasy: Awakening* also has a lot of imagery from nature, which relates directly to both poems’ themes about how humans connect with nature.)

- Invite six students to formally introduce and add the following works to the museum:

<!-- -->

- Langston Hughes, “The Negro Speaks of Rivers”

- Georgia Douglas Johnson, “Calling Dreams”

- Georgia Douglas Johnson, “Hope”

- Meta Warrick Fuller, *Ethiopia Awakening*

- Winold Reiss, *African Phantasy: Awakening*
