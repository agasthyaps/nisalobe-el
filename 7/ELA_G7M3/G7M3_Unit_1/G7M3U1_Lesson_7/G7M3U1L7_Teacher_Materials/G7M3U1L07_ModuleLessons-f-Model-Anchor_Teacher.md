<td><p><strong>The poem suggests that black people were present since the beginning of time and at important places and events throughout history. “My soul has grown deep” (4) — the speaker uses language comparing himself to the rivers. This connection may suggest a deep understanding or wisdom.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The author begins and ends the poem with a similar phrase. This helps convey the importance of the rivers and his relationship to them throughout the poem.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The speaker also repeats “I . . .” throughout the poem to show that he sees himself in his ancestors. “lulled me to sleep” (6) — the author is discussing the river almost as if it were his mother.</strong></p></td>

<td>How does the author or artist develop the theme? (For artwork, the theme may be communicated by different parts of the piece or the whole piece and may not develop over the course of the piece. However, details may add to or change the theme.)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>The speaker describes historical places and rivers and his connection to them. He repeats the phrase “I’ve known rivers” to show his connection to them. He uses figurative language to show how important the rivers are to him. The chronological structure of the poem helps the reader travel from the earliest civilization and freedom, through slavery, and finally back to freedom.</strong></td>
