<td><p><strong>Structure</strong></p>
<p><strong>How does structure (including rhyme and repetition) contribute to meaning?</strong></p>
<p><strong>The author begins and ends the poem with a similar phrase. This helps convey the importance of the rivers and his relationship to them throughout the poem. The author also repeats “I . . .” throughout the poem to show that he sees himself in ancient rivers and events (or in his ancestors). The chronological structure of the poem helps the reader travel from the earliest civilization and freedom, through slavery, and finally back to freedom.</strong></p></td>
<td><p><strong>Language</strong></p>
<p><strong>How does the language (including word choice and figurative language) in the poem influence meaning?</strong></p>
<p><strong>In the title, the words “the Negro” suggest that the poem is about all black people. The poem highlights the significant role black people have played throughout human history.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“My soul has grown deep” (The speaker uses language comparing himself to the rivers. This connection may suggest a deep understanding or wisdom, like the rivers, he will endure.) “lulled me to sleep” (The author is discussing the river almost as if it were his mother.) “Muddy bosom turn all golden in the sunset” (suggests, in spite of the pain of slavery, a positive turn in the historical black experience)</strong></p></td>

**Putting It All Together**

Below, write a paragraph explaining how the poet uses structure and language to develop a theme. Be sure to introduce the poem, state the theme, and support your interpretation with specific references to the structure and the language in the text.

The poem “The Negro Speaks of Rivers” is about a vision the speaker has of connecting with different rivers throughout history. The speaker says he’s known “rivers as ancient as the world” and refers to rivers from ancient Egypt and Africa and the Middle East, as well as America. The rivers trace black history from freedom, to slavery, and back to freedom. He talks about how his soul has “grown deep like the river,” which further shows this connection. The title of the poem also indicates that the author is speaking for more people than just himself. He is saying that his people have a deep, rich history. Together, this develops the theme that black people are connected to a long, rich, and painful history and draw strength and wisdom from it.

| **“Lift Every Voice and Sing”**               | **Both of these works develop the theme of connecting to the past—but the past “Lift Every Voice and Sing” refers to is negative. The connection to the past in “The Negro Speaks of Rivers” is positive. Both suggest that a difficult past can make you strong.** |
