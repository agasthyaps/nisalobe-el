Launch

Remind students that they have been focusing on how poets use figurative language to create meaning. Consider displaying the previous Language Dive from Module 3, Unit 1, Lessons 5–6 (**Out from the gloomy past, Till now we stand at last, Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast.**) and invite students to recall how the author used figurative language to develop the theme of the poem. Share that this Language Dive also uses figurative language to develop the theme of the poem.

My soul has grown deep

Deconstruct

- **My soul**

“Who or what is this chunk about? What word(s) helps us figure this out?” (This chunk is about the speaker’s soul. My refers to the speaker in the poem and indicates that the soul belongs to the speaker. A soul is the part of a person that is not physical but contains a person’s thoughts, feelings, and character.) (noun phrase)

- Students can discuss in pairs whether they think Langston Hughes is referring to his own soul or the soul of another speaker. (Responses will vary, but may include that Langston Hughes is referring to the soul of black people, rather than his own soul or that of a specific individual, and that the poem alludes to the speaker being present during important moments in African and black American history since the beginning of time. This suggests that the speaker represents the voices of black people over thousands of years.)

- **has grown deep**

“What does this chunk tell us about the speaker’s soul?” (That it has grown deep.) (present perfect verb tense + adverb = verb phrase)

“What if we replaced has grown with grew? How would that change the meaning?” (Replacing has grown with grew would tell us that the speaker’s soul grew deep at a specific moment in the past, rather than over time. Has grown tells us the speaker’s soul grew deep over time, emphasizing the importance of the journey, and telling us there is a connection to the present.)

- For heavier support, consider explaining that **has grown** is written in the present perfect verb tense. Note the following about the present perfect verb tense:

- Present perfect tells us the action is completed (the speaker’s voice **has already grown** deep) but the action impacts the present (the speaker’s soul is now deep because it has grown).

- Present perfect emphasizes the importance of the journey—**has grown** tells us this action happened over time, rather than in one specific moment.

- To identify present perfect, look for a present tense form of **have** (**have** or **has**) followed by a past participle (present tense form of **have** + past participle = present perfect verb tense).

- Consider adding a timeline with the word **soul** written at a point in the past, and an arrow connecting from the word **soul**, leading up to the present. The arrow could get bigger over time, emphasizing the importance of the journey and the impact on the present moment.

- Students can discuss in pairs what they think caused the speaker’s soul to grow deep over time. Encourage students to refer to other lines of the poem as they discuss. (Responses will vary, but may include that the speaker’s soul has grown deep over thousands of years because of historical events. Students may reference the lines in the poem stating that the speaker “bathed in the Euphrates,” “built my hut near the Congo,” “heard the singing of the Mississippi . . . ” These moments represent important moments in African and black American history, starting with the Euphrates river symbolizing the beginning of human civilization, leading up to freedom from slavery at the Mississippi.)

- Students can use Conversation Cues as they discuss. To provide heavier support, display a suggested sequence, such as the one below:

- Goal 1. Let’s take time to think and write or sketch.

- Goal 1: So, do you mean \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?

- Goal 3: Why do you think so?

- Goal 4: Who can add on to what your classmate said?

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Students can complete the sentence frame to share about something they have done over time that has an impact on the present. 

> “I \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ over the years.”

**have** + past participle + adjective or adverb

> (e.g., I **<u>have become empathetic</u>** over the years.)

- To provide lighter support: Invite students to extend the frame using the conjunction because to add more context. I have \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_over the years because \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. (e.g., I have **<u>become empathetic</u>** over the years because **<u>I have intentionally listened to others and seek to understand their perspective</u>**.)

- To provide heavier support: Provide a word bank for students to choose from when completing the frames (e.g., grown/become; empathetic/compassionate/respectful/responsible).

like the rivers.

Deconstruct

- **like**

“What does the word like tell us?” (Like is used to compare the upcoming chunk to the previous chunk; it tells us the speaker’s soul is similar to what comes next.) (preposition)

- **the rivers**

“What is the speaker’s soul similar to? How are they similar?” (The speaker’s soul is similar to the rivers because they are both deep. Both the speaker’s soul and the rivers go back to the beginning of time and have been shaped throughout history.)

- Students can close their eyes and imagine rivers that go back to the beginning of time. Then, they can imagine the speaker traveling with these rivers, encountering the many important moments throughout history. They can open their eyes and sketch what they imagined on their note-catchers. 

- Students may recall from their work in Grade 6 (L.6.5a) that the word **like** is used to form a simile. Remind students that a simile is a type of figurative language that uses **like** or **as** to directly compare two unlike things. Similes are often used in poetry to compare living things (e.g., my soul) to nonliving things (e.g., the rivers) in order to spark the readers’ imagination and make their writing more interesting and lyrical.

- Students can work in pairs to list other similes they know, using the word **like** or **as** (e.g., to sleep like a log, as hungry as a bear) and to discuss the literal meanings behind the similes. Encourage students to share similes in their home language. If time allows, students can add the similes on their note-catchers. 

My soul has grown deep like the rivers.

Reconstruct

- **<u>My soul has grown deep</u> like the rivers.**

“How can we say these lines in a more literal way?” (Responses will vary, but may include: The speaker, who represents the voices of black people over thousands of years, feels connected to their past and has been shaped by history since the beginning of time.)

- Remind students that earlier in this lesson they looked at how figurative language is used to develop the theme in the poem. Invite students to share out what one theme of the poem is. (People are connected to their pasts; they can hold these deep connections within them.)

“Can you figure out how the author uses figurative language to develop the theme in this poem? Why do you think the author uses figurative language to develop the theme rather than doing so in a more literal way?” (Responses will vary, but may include that the author uses figurative language to develop the theme by comparing the speaker’s soul to rivers. The rivers go back to the beginning of time, symbolizing the speaker’s deep connection to the past. The author uses figurative language to capture the reader’s attention and emphasize the speaker’s strong connection to different periods of time.)

- If time allows, consider inviting students to discuss why the author repeats this line twice in the poem—once at the beginning and once at the end. (Responses will vary, but may include that repetition helps to develop the theme, emphasizing the speaker’s connection to the past through the rivers.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question, ‘What are some of the historical factors surrounding and contributing to the Harlem Renaissance?’” (Responses will vary.)

Practice (Sentence)

- Students can complete the following sentence frame to practice using figurative language to express how something they have done in the past over time impacts the present. 

> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ has/have grown \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ like \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

noun phrase adjective noun phrase

> (e.g., **<u>My heart</u>** has grown **<u>bright</u>** like **<u>the stars</u>**.)

- Ask:

“How can we use figurative language in our own writing to develop them and contribute to meaning?”

- To provide lighter support: Invite students to rearrange the sentence frame, writing the sentence in a different order. (e.g., Like \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_\_ has/have grown deep.)

- To provide heavier support: Invite students to discuss the meaning of the original lines in home language groups.
