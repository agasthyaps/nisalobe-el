Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- SL.7.1 – Opening A: On an entrance ticket, students review collaborative discussion norms and set goals for their own participation in the collaborative discussion.

- RL.7.2 – Work Time A: Students engage in a collaborative conversation in which they discuss how the poems “The Negro Speaks of Rivers” and “I Shall Return Again” develop similar themes and analyze how these themes relate to the artworks *Ethiopia Awakening* and *African Phantasy: Awakening.*

- RL.7.4 – Work Time A: Students discuss how the language of the poems “The Negro Speaks of Rivers” and “I Shall Return Again” creates meaning.

- RL.7.5 – Work Time A: Students discuss how the structure of the poems “The Negro Speaks of Rivers” and “I Shall Return Again” creates meaning.

- SL.7.1 – Work Time A: Students engage in a collaborative discussion, especially using their Level 4 Conversation Cues.

- RI.7.10 – Closing and Assessment A: Students share about their independent research reading texts to hold them accountable for their reading homework. Use Independent Reading Sample Plans (see the Tools page) if you do not have your own independent reading review routines.

- To hear all students discuss, choose one of the following two options:

- **Fishbowl Discussion:** Divide the class in half and arrange one group in an outer circle and the other in an inner circle. The group in the inner circle discusses the prompt for 7 minutes, then the outer group moves to the middle to discuss the prompt for 7 minutes. (Allot time for switching groups.) While in the outer circle, students must listen and take notes so they can use the information from both discussions to help them with their analysis in part 2 of the end of unit assessment in Lesson 14.

- **Small Group Recorded Discussions:** Create groups of about five students and provide each group with a video recording device (a tablet or phone). Help each group place the camera to capture all students in the discussion. (Allot time to set this up.) Give groups 7 minutes for their discussion. Circulate to help with technical issues and to prompt with the follow-up discussion questions.

- In this lesson, the habits of character focus is on becoming effective learners and ethical people. The characteristics that students practice are respect, empathy, compassion, collaboration, and taking initiative as they participate in a collaborative discussion. They also practice integrity as they share about their independent research reading.

- In the poetry and artwork discussed during this lesson, the writers and artists demonstrated courage and perseverance in the face of injustice.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release more responsibility more quickly to students as they comprehend the tasks or concepts. For example:

- Ask students skilled in collaborative discussion to help lead the discussion, noticing when a quieter member of the group needs to be invited into the conversation and asking follow-up questions to move the dialogue along.

- If using the fishbowl format for discussion, allow these students to be in the inner discussion circle first so they can model discussion norms and analysis for other students.

- Video-record exemplary discussions so students may learn in future classes or future years how to achieve mastery with text-based discussions.

- Ask students successful in independent research reading to share tips, strategies, texts, and resources with students who may struggle with it.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students have focused on analyzing the structure, language, and theme of poetry and artwork from the Harlem Renaissance on note-catchers, in selected response questions, and in constructed response questions. In this lesson, they analyze the structure, language, and theme of a poem from the Harlem Renaissance in a collaborative discussion.

Support All Students

- Some students may require more support in preparing for a discussion. During the Opening, encourage these students to use the Conversation Cues on the Discussion Norms anchor chart to draft questions and responses on their note-catchers. They can then read these as they participate in the discussion. ▲

- Also, if using the fishbowl format for discussion, place students who need more support in the outer circle for the first round of discussion so they can observe their peers and have more time to gather their thoughts. ▲

- The subject matter discussed in this lesson includes references to racism and injustice. Continue to monitor students to determine if issues surface from the content of this chapter that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually. To support students in processing this content, ask: “What habit of character did you use as you read and discussed these texts?” Students may need to draw on perseverance, empathy, and compassion as they read and discuss this content, being sensitive to their own and others’ reactions to the information.

- Students may need additional support sharing their independent research reading with the whole group or in the fishbowl format in front of the group. Allow their group to work in a quieter space with a recording device, as opposed to a fishbowl. Invite students to share their independent research reading with you independently. Alternatively, continue with the fishbowl and/or whole group share, but have students practice mindfulness, deep breathing, and relaxation before sharing.

- To support ELLs, this lesson provides teacher-led and peer-collaborative analysis of the structure, language, and themes in the poem “Hope” by Georgia Douglas Johnson. While analyzing poetry may be challenging, the teacher and peer support throughout the lesson will help ELLs successfully participate in the analysis.

- ELLs may find it challenging to conduct more pair and independent analysis of the poem. While this gradual release is important to prepare students for their end of unit assessment, it can be challenging. For peer-collaborative activities, consider multilevel triads to support and challenge all students. For independent analysis, ensure that students understand the tasks and grapple with independent work for as long as they can before receiving teacher or peer support.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.A.3, 7.I.B.5, 7.I.B.8, 7.I.C.12, and 7.II.A.1.

Assessment Guidance

- Assessing the discussion is optional. As this is an informal assessment of discussion and analysis skills, have ready the Collaborative Discussion checklist (see materials below) to give targeted feedback to students during a fast-paced discussion. Also, use a clipboard to enable circulating during the discussions. Finally, video-record the discussions to enable multiple viewings and to use in providing targeted feedback.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will launch Unit 2 of the module with a Gallery Walk, learning about the historical context of the Harlem Renaissance through art, writing, and videos.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – SL.7.1 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 12.**

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique to review their responses to the first two questions. Inform students that the second two questions will be helpful during their discussion if they need a question to move the conversation forward.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

- In addition to the preparation on Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 12, encourage students to review their Analyze Poetry note-catchers from Lessons 7–11, highlighting information they would like to include in their discussion. This extra preparation will give students confidence with content and language structures they can use in the discussion.

For Heavier Support

- To enable students to better respond to Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 12, encourage them to discuss their strengths and goals for the discussion with a home-language or similar-level partner. Homogeneous partners increase student comfort and confidence while ensuring comprehension or uncovering comprehension issues.

Work Time

A. Collaborative Discussion: Structure, Language, and Theme in Poetry and Art – SL.7.1 (25 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can explain how poets use structure and language to develop themes over the course of poems.”

“I can engage effectively in collaborative discussions, building on others’ ideas and expressing my own clearly.”

- Direct students to form the predetermined groups and organize themselves into either the fishbowl or small group discussion format. Display and distribute the **Collaborative Discussion: Analyze Structure, Language, and Theme in Poetry and Art** handout. Review the directions as necessary, especially the discussion prompt:

- “How do the poems ‘The Negro Speaks of Rivers’ and ‘I Shall Return’ develop similar themes? How are these themes related to the artworks *Ethiopia Awakening* and *African Phantasy: Awakening* ”?

- Remind students to show respect, empathy, and compassion as they follow the classroom rules for collegial discussion. They will also take the initiative as they participate in a discussion. Refer to the **Work to Become Ethical People** and **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor charts** as necessary to review respect, empathy, compassion, and taking the initiative.

- Display the following during the discussion:

- **Meta Warrick Fuller’s *Ethiopia Awakening ***

- An **online image of Winold Reiss’ *African Phantasy: Awakening ***(http://eled.org/0206)

- Remind students to use the following materials during their discussion:

- Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 12

- **“I Shall Return” handout**

- **Analyze Poetry: “I Shall Return” note-catcher**

- **“The Negro Speaks of Rivers” in *One Last Word,* page 65**

- **Analyze Poetry note-catcher**

- **Discussion Norms anchor chart,** especially the Level 4 Conversation Cues

- **Quote Accurately from the Text handout**

- Invite students to begin the discussion. Circulate to make informal assessments on the **Collaborative Discussion checklist** if desired and to prompt students with the questions they created on Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 12.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- Before the discussion in Work Time A, post the discussion prompt from the lesson and allow students several minutes to work with a partner, practicing responses. Remind students to draw on the content and language structures from their Analyze Poetry note-catchers ▲ from Lessons 7–11 for evidence in their responses. This rehearsal will give students confidence with content and language structures they can use in the discussion.

For Heavier Support

- Before the discussion in Work Time A, post the prompt from the lesson and the following sentence frames, encouraging students to work in pairs to complete the frames in writing and then practice them orally. Remind students to draw on the content and language structures from their Analyze Poetry note-catchers ▲ from Lessons 7-11 to complete these sentence frames.

- The poems both develop a theme of. . .

- “The Negro Speaks of Rivers” / “I Shall Return” develops this theme by. . .

- One example of this structure/figurative language is. . .

- This example develops the theme by. . .

- The themes from the poems are related to the themes in the artwork because. . .

- The artwork develops this theme by. . .

This written and oral rehearsal will give students more confidence with content and language structures they can use in the discussion.

Closing and Assessment

A. Independent Research Reading Share – RI.7.10 (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to guide students to share their independent research reading, reminding students that the purpose of research reading is to build their content knowledge, domain-specific vocabulary, and achievement on reading complex texts. As necessary, use the Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart to review integrity.

- Refer to the **Independent Reading Sample Plans** to guide students through a research reading share or use your own routine.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- After the independent research reading share, allocate time for debriefing. Invite students to discuss with partners the value of independent research reading and set goals for the future. Reflection and goal-setting will increase student-engagement and appreciation of independent research reading.

For Heavier Support

- Before students share their independent research reading, remind them that the purpose of this on-level reading is to increase their knowledge of and engagement with the topic of the Harlem Renaissance. Explain that reading many texts at their level about one topic increases their reading, vocabulary, and analysis skills. Also, reviewing their book choice will ensure that students are engaged with their book and give them an opportunity to find a different one if they are no longer interested in their choice.

Homework

A. Collaborative Discussion Reflection

- Students complete **Homework: Collaborative Discussion Reflection** to reflect on their stars and steps as a contributor to a collaborative discussion.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Next, they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal.**
