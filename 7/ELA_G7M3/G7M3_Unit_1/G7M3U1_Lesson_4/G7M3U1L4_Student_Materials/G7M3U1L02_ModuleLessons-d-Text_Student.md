OPENING CHORUS \[“Election Day”\]

CHORUS.

Election Day, Election Day,

That’s the day when everybody’s happy,

That’s the day when everybody’s glad.

Election Day, Election Day,

That’s the day when you forget

All the aches and pains you have had.

You gather at the election polls,

And there you stand in line.

Although the day be dark and cold,

Still you never mind.

You are thinking of the politicians whom last year you trusted,

And when they got into positions, promises they busted.

You will try not make the same mistake—

This Election Day. Hooray!

Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

*(looking to stage right)*

*(Enter supporters of Steve Jenkins right.)*

JENKINS SUPPORTERS.

We stand for everything that we can get.

Our man is for the country going wet.

We’ll bring back the whiskey, beer, and gin.

We know that Steve Jenkins will win.

CHORUS.

The gang of Steve Jenkins, a lame and hungry bunch,

They’re going to bring back the five-cent beer and lunch.

If he’s elected, it sure will be a sin.

We hope that he’ll never, never win.

*(following Steve Jenkins supporters as they exit right)*

*(looking towards left)*

Hooray! Hooray!

What crowd is this a-coming . . .

Hooray! Hooray!

With whistling fife and drumming?

Let’s clear the way for a great big demonstration.

They will carry the day with a riotous consternation.

*(Enter left Mrs. Peck and Mr. Peck’s supporters. Onions is one supporter and carries a drum.)*

PECK SUPPORTERS.

Me, him, and she,

She, him, and me,

We’re the ones who will elect

For our Mayor, we will have Sam Peck.

You will agree that me, him, and she

Will take ’em, make ’em, shake ’em, break ’em,

Just we three.

CHORUS.

Gee, but they are funny,

“She, him, and me.”

It’s worth lots of money such a sight to see.

Poor Cox’s Army ain’t

One, two, three.

With a bunch of hecks like old Sam Peck’s

“Me, him, and she.”

*(The two stanzas above repeat. Mrs. Peck and supporters exit.)*

*(Enter Harry Walton’s supporters right.)*

HARRY SUPPORTERS.

We’re for Harry Walton, here we come.

We’ll vote for Harry Walton, our favorite son.

And with banners blowing, we will soon be showing

(If we keep step with the *hep hep* and rattle of the drum),

Honor is our motto, bright and grand.

Justice is the platform on which we stand.

And since we are in it, we are going to win it.

Harry Walton is the man.

He is the man for whom we all will stand.

*(Mr. Williams appears on hotel step.)*

CHORUS. *(addressing Mr. Williams)* Speech! Speech!

JIM WILLIAMS. Friends and citizens of Jimtown.—It is useless for me to attempt to tell you what kind of a man Harry Walton is and that he *is* the right man for the Mayor, for no doubt you all know him as well as I. In fact, we have watched him grow from boyhood.

CHORUS. *(interrupting)* He is the man!

JIM WILLIAMS. *(continuing)* His honesty, integrity, and efficiency make him the logical man for the office, and it is the solemn duty of each and every citizen of Jimtown to vote for him, for he’s all right.

CITIZEN. What’s the matter with Harry Walton?

CHORUS. He’s all right!

JIM WILLIAMS. Who’s all right?

CHORUS. Harry Walton’s all right! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

. . .

*(The chorus repeats the stanza above. Dance. The chorus exits.)*

JESSIE. *(following father center stage)* Father, your speech was brief but to the point, and you are right. Harry is the man.

JIM WILLIAMS. Well, daughter, no doubt some may say that my efforts in his behalf are prompted by the fact that he is to become my son-in-law, but my only motive is to see the right man in the right place.

JESSIE. And Harry is the right man.

JIM WILLIAMS. Well *(laugh)*, I trust my daughter is looking at it through unbiased eyes and not because she is to become the future Mrs. Harry Walton.

*  
(Ruth Little approaches.)*

JESSIE. *(rebuking)* Oh, Father!

. . .

**\[SECOND EXCERPT\]**

*(Enter right Harry Walton followed by Onions. Mr. Williams appears on hotel step.)*

. . .

JIM WILLIAMS. Harry, how is the election coming along?

HARRY WALTON. Glad to say it is coming along quite well.

JIM WILLIAMS. That’s fine and dandy. My boy, it behooves you to win, for if you are beaten by either of those ignoramuses, Steve Jenkins or Sam Peck, who would run our town just as they run their grocery store, I shall never consent to you becoming my son-in-law.

*(Jessie listening.)*

HARRY WALTON. *(reproachfully)* Why, Mr. Williams!

JIM WILLIAMS. *(walking to hotel)* That’s final. *(goes into hotel)*

JESSIE. *(making sure father has gone, then crossing to Harry)*—Harry, you can’t lose. Jenkins or Peck beating you, why the idea is absurd.

HARRY WALTON. *(down-heartedly)* I know, Jessie, but suppose . . .

SONG: \[“Love Will Find a Way”\]

JESSIE.

Come, dear, and don’t let our faith weaken.

Let’s keep our love fires burning bright.

HARRY WALTON.

Your love for me is heav’nly beacon,

Guiding me through love’s darkest night.

JESSIE.

Don’t start minding or fault-finding,

No matter how dark one’s path may grow.

HARRY WALTON.

Fate won’t hurry. Well, don’t worry.

We’ll just keep our hearts aglow.

BOTH.

Love will find a way, though skies now are gray.

Love like ours can never be ruled.

Cupid’s not schooled that way.

Dry each tear-dimmed eye.

Clouds will soon roll by.

Though fate may lead us astray,

My dearie, mark what I say:

Love will find a way.

*(They repeat the chorus and exit right.)*

. . .

**\[THIRD EXCERPT\]**

*(Steve Jenkins wins the election for Mayor. Tom Sharper, his campaign manager, speaks with Jessie in the following scene.)*

*(Jessie enters left. Tom enters right. Meet center stage.)*

TOM SHARPER. Well, Miss Williams, tomorrow Steve Jenkins takes his chair as the Mayor of Jimtown. My candidate. Oh, but by the way, I heard that your father objected to your marrying Harry inasmuch as he lost in the election, and I am truly sorry for that indeed.

JESSIE. *(independently)* Well, that will never make any difference with Harry and me.

TOM SHARPER. And I hope not.

JESSIE. Never in the least.

TOM SHARPER. That’s fine.

SONG: \[“I’m Just Wild About Harry”\]

JESSE.

There’s just one fellow for me in this world.

Harry’s his name,

That’s what I claim.

Why for ev’ry fellow there must be a girl.

I’ve found my mate

By kindness of fate.

*  
(Chorus of SYNCOPATING SUNFLOWERS enters to assist with song and dance.)*

I’m just wild about Harry,

And Harry’s wild about me.

The heav’nly blisses of his kisses

Fill me with ecstasy.

He’s sweet just like choc’late candy

And just like honey from the bee.

Oh, I’m just wild about Harry,

And he’s just wild about, cannot do without,

He’s just wild about me.

. . .

*\[In the last scene, Mrs. Peck, Sam Peck’s wife, speaks with Mr. Penrose, an investigator whom all three candidates separately hired to see if Sam Peck and Steve Jenkins were dishonest and stealing from each other in the grocery store they run together. Penrose found that they were both stealing from each other, so Harry Walton will become Mayor and be allowed to marry Jessie after all.\]*
