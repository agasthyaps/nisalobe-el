***Shuffle Along:* The Harlem Renaissance Musical Sensation**

*Shuffle Along* is considered by many to be the start of the Harlem Renaissance. It was a wildly successful musical with a fascinating cast of characters at its center. *Shuffle Along* was written by Flournoy Miller and Aubrey Lyles, and the music was written by Noble Sissle and Eubie Blake. The show’s main lead, Lottie Gee, became famous at 35 years old. Until then, she had worked tirelessly in vaudeville shows, which sometimes mocked black Americans. In *Shuffle Along*, Gee was finally thrust into stardom due to her skillful dancing and singing. Paul Robeson, Josephine Baker, Nat King Cole, and Florence Mills all got their start in *Shuffle Along* and went on to become incredibly famous.

So how famous was *Shuffle Along*? According to *The New York Times*, “In order to deal with the crush of patrons, the city had to alter the traffic pattern around the theater, turning a stretch of 63rd into a one-way street. It was a supernova.” It may just be the reason why chorus lines have jazz dancers (*The New York Times*). The chorus featured “an improvisational style of dancing that encouraged individual expression,” and inspired numerous other chorus lines along the way (*ArtsEdge*). After *Shuffle Along*, black American dance became an important aspect of American theater.

*Shuffle Along* broke the mold in many ways. It was the first show to be written, produced, and performed by black writers, musicians, actors, and dancers. The writing was innovative, and the dancing and music were electrifying. At the time, black performers were relegated to vaudeville shows, or not allowed onstage at all. Journalists wondered, “Will white audiences pay to see black performers onstage?” The answer, resoundingly, was, “Yes!”

*Shuffle Along* was also the first show to feature black performers falling in love onstage. At the time, it was okay for them to be silly and joking, but romance? That outpouring of emotion from black performers was unheard of. Previously, it was thought that white audiences would be uncomfortable viewing black lovers. *Shuffle Along* proved otherwise. Roger Matthews, the tenor, and Lottie Gee, the prima donna, chronicle their love in the song, “Love Will Find a Way.” Gee goes on to express her feelings further in the song, “I’m Just Wild About Harry,” a foot-tapping crowd-pleaser. President Harry Truman even went on to use it for his campaign.

The show also helped to desegregate the theater. Black audience members had long been forced to sit upstairs in the balcony, while white audience members enjoyed closer seats. *Shuffle Along* audience members sat integrated, together, for one of the first times in history. The show ran for 504 performances at the Cort Theater and at the Sixty-Third Street Theater. It wasn’t an easy space to work in. For one thing, the show required an orchestra. There wasn’t space for an orchestra at the Sixty-Third Street Theater. But, as they say in show business, “The show must go on.” The first three rows in the audience were ripped out to make space for the orchestra. People in the show joked that *Shuffle Along* should be renamed “Scuffle Along” due to their perseverance and improvisational skill in the face of challenge.

Eventually, things took a downturn for *Shuffle Along*. With success and fame, often come strife and struggle. The music was beloved and making tons of money from sales of sheet music and records. But the book did not make any money. The writers felt that the money should be split down the middle, while the music producers felt otherwise. They had a falling out, and the show ended. The show’s lead female, Lottie Gee, may have stolen the show, but privately she suffered from bouts of depression. Many wonder what would have happened had the writers and musicians stuck together.

Still, so much good came out of *Shuffle Along*. It inspired generations of artists, musicians, and writers. Numerous black musicals followed in its footsteps, showcasing comedians, choruses, and new dance forms. *Shuffle Along* changed the face of theater as it broke down barriers and improved race relations. This musical made waves.

**Composer**

**Eubie Blake**

1883–1983 / Lyricist, composer, pianist

The son of former slaves, James “Eubie” Blake went on to become an incredibly famous musician. His specialty was ragtime music, an upbeat form with lots of rhythm. He started playing the pump organ at age four or five. Then, at sixteen he composed “The Charleston Rag.” By his twenties, he had regular jobs as a musician.

In 1915, Blake met singer and lyricist Noble Sissle, and they performed in vaudeville together. Unlike other black performers at the time, they didn’t wear blackface to make their faces appear darker. White audiences preferred black performers in blackface as “they could hide their blackness behind a darker blackness, a false one, a safe one. They wouldn’t be claiming power. By mocking themselves, their own race, they were giving it up” (*The New York Times*). Blake and Sissle refused to perform in the racist blackface, choosing instead to wear tuxedos. Their song, “It’s All Your Fault,” performed by the vaudeville star Sophie Tucker, became a huge success.

In 1921, the musically talented Blake and Sissle joined forces with the writers Flournoy Miller and Aubrey L. Lyles. Together, they created *Shuffle Along*, an all-black musical comedy. Blake and Sissle’s songs in *Shuffle Along*, including “Love Will Find a Way” and “I’m Just Wild about Harry,” proved phenomenally successful. *Shuffle Along* launched many of Blake’s most enduring songs.

Blake and Sissle’s partnership continued strong following *Shuffle Along*. They went on to write two more popular musicals, *Elsie* and *Chocolate Dandies*. Blake also wrote musical revues and held benefit concerts for many organizations. He cared about advancing not only his career but also the careers of other black American musicians.

One of Blake’s best-known songs, “I’m Just Wild About Harry,” was chosen in 1948 by presidential candidate Harry Truman. Truman used it as his official campaign song. When Truman won the election, Blake was asked to go to Washington, D.C., to write a different version of the song for the presidential inauguration. Sadly, at the last minute, Blake was not given the opportunity to do so. Instead, a white singer did the honors.

In spite of this letdown, Blake was a superstar. He appeared on TV numerous times and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1981.

**Writers**

**James Weldon Johnson**

1871–1938 / Poet, novelist, playwright, civil rights leader

James Weldon Johnson was a true renaissance man. He excelled in many different subjects and areas. He was a songwriter, poet, novelist, journalist, critic, and autobiographer as well as a public speaker, lawyer, and social activist. This talented man accomplished a great deal in his lifetime.

He was born in 1897 in Jacksonville, Florida. One of his most incredible accomplishments is that he became the first black man to be admitted to the Florida bar as a lawyer. He also partnered with his brother John Rosamond to compose the poem and song “Lift Every Voice and Sing.” This song has often been called the Black National Anthem. He also composed operas and Broadway shows with his brother as well as a talented friend named Bob Cole.

In 1913, he wrote his only novel anonymously, The *Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man*. When he informed the public that he wrote it, everyone thought it was nonfiction. To clarify his upbringing and life, he followed his novel with his true autobiography, *Along This Way*, in 1933. He edited a volume of poetry called *The Book of American Negro Poetry*. Some say that this book was a catalyst for the Harlem Renaissance.

Johnson was eager to support black artists and writers. He knew that black Americans lacked economic power. But he hoped that literature and art could improve their daily lives. He established a very successful black American fellowship program through the Julius Rosenwald Fund. Also, as the executive secretary for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), he supported black talent. At the end of his career, he left Harlem for a professorship at Fisk University in Tennessee. He was certainly a man of many talents and a champion of black people.

**Claude McKay**

1889–1948 / Poet, novelist

Claude McKay was born in rural Jamaica in 1889. The son of peasant farmers, McKay grew up proud of his black Jamaican and African heritage. McKay started writing poetry as a boy, copying the great British poets that his brother, a teacher, had introduced him to. By the time he was a teen, his British neighbor convinced him to write poems in a Jamaican dialect. At age 17, McKay moved to Kingston, the capital of Jamaica, to work as a woodworker. But he soon returned home, disgusted by the intense racism he witnessed and experienced in the mainly white city.

By the young age of 23, McKay had written enough poems to publish two volumes of poetry. One volume was a celebration of the black peasant life in Jamaica. The other was a darker portrayal of black urban life in racist Kingston. McKay was awarded for these works and used the money to travel to the United States. There he studied in South Carolina and Kansas, then moved to New York City. The racism he experienced in the United States inspired him to continue writing and publishing poems and essays in magazines. His most famous poem was “If We Must Die,” which described black people fighting for their rights as if they were being violently pushed up against a wall.

Disillusioned by the racism in the United States, McKay left and traveled to Europe and North Africa. He continued writing poems, but also began writing novels. His first novel, *Home to Harlem*, was about the dark side of Harlem and the struggles of black people to survive in white America. It was the first novel by a black writer to rise to the best-seller lists. However, some black American editors believed the novel portrayed black people negatively. They refused to publish or support McKay. Still, he went on to write and publish more novels, poems, and essays, becoming an important voice of the Harlem Renaissance.

**Artists**

**Augusta Savage**

1892–1962 / Sculptor

Augusta Savage was more than just a gifted sculptor. She was also an activist, community organizer, teacher, and a leader in breaking down barriers for black artists. Her artwork is acclaimed for its images of black people. Seen by some as outsiders, Savage elevated them to mainstream American citizens. Indeed, she is central to the Harlem Renaissance, not just for her activism and talented artwork, but for her ability to connect artists from many generations.

Savage knew from a very young age that she wanted to become a sculptor. In the 1920s, she moved to New York City to study at Cooper Union’s School of Art. Her teachers knew immediately that she was talented. They recognized her talent with a commission to create a bust of black Harlem Renaissance scholar W. E. B. Du Bois. Savage went on to create images of many other black American leaders, including black nationalist and entrepreneur Marcus Garvey.

In 1924, Savage sculpted a bust of her nephew, Ellis Ford. Many consider this bust, titled *Gamin* (French for “street urchin”), to be her finest work. The bust was so well received that it won a Julius Rosenwald Fellowship for Savage to study in Paris.

When Savage returned to Harlem, she taught adults art at the Savage Studio of Arts and Crafts. She also was the first director of Harlem’s Community Arts Center, an important place in Harlem that supported black people to learn about their culture through fine art.

For the 1939 New York World’s Fair, Savage was commissioned to create a sculpture. She titled the piece *The Harp*, though it is also known as *The Voice* and *Lift Every Voice and Sing*. Why so many names for this one sculpture? Savage drew inspiration from Weldon Johnson’s 1900 song, “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” in creating the sculpture. Today, Savage is best-known for this sculpture.

In addition to collaborating with writers like Weldon and Harlem community members, Savage was also a key member of the Harlem art community and a member of the so-called 306 Group. Named for its location, the group was housed at 306 West 141st Street. Savage collaborated a great deal with members of the group and other artists in Harlem. She shared techniques and ideas with black artists, including Charles Alston, Romare Bearden, Jacob Lawrence, and Morgan and Marvin Smith.

**Aaron Douglas**

1899–1979 / Painter, illustrator

Aaron Douglas was a central artist in the Harlem Renaissance. His style, influenced by jazz music, was distinctive in its use of strong geometric shapes and lines, African masks, African dance, and African figures. Douglas grew up in Kansas and graduated with a bachelor of fine arts from the University of Nebraska. In 1924, he moved to New York to work with other black artists. He first worked as an apprentice to Winold Reiss. He illustrated covers for magazines such as Charles S. Johnson’s *Opportunity*, W.E.B. Du Bois’ *The Crisis*, and Wallace Thurman’s *Fire and Harlem* (AIGA). In 1925, he collaborated with the philosopher Alain Locke, whose 1925 anthology *The New Negro*, included many of Douglas’ angular, African-influenced illustrations. Douglas also illustrated writer James Weldon Johnson’s book *God’s Trombones*, which propelled Douglas into stardom.

In 1934, Douglas was commissioned to paint *Aspects of Negro Life*, which became one of Douglas’ best-known works. The four-panel mural is housed in the 135th Street branch of the New York Public Library, now called the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. The murals show three figures, each portraying different aspects of the black experience. One figure shows the escape of former slaves; another shows economic hardship; a third shows a saxophonist. The jazz musician central to the mural stands as a symbol of the growth, change, and opportunity through music and art during the Harlem Renaissance.

Douglas moved to Tennessee in 1938, where he served as the chair of the art department at Fisk University. He died in 1979.
