Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RL.7.7 – Opening A: On an entrance ticket, students explore musical techniques while listening to “Election Day” song.

- RI.7.1 – Work Time A: Students read a short article about the importance of *Shuffle Along* and use textual evidence to support inferences about society and art drawn from the article.

- RL.7.4 – Work Time B: Students read and analyze the book and lyrics of the beginning of act 1, scene 1 of *Shuffle Along*, analyzing how repetition and language create meaning.

- RL.7.7 – Closing and Assessment A: Students listen to the song version of “Election Day,” comparing it to the text version and analyzing the effects of musical techniques.

- In Opening A, students reflect on the module guiding questions. This is not mandatory—students share their reflections only if they want to do so. It is important to be sensitive to students’ and families’ feelings and experiences of racism, and to acknowledge that these feelings and experiences may differ. The main point students should understand by the end of this module is that the Harlem Renaissance was a time of cultural rebirth despite and in response to great racism, oppression, and racial violence.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become ethical people by showing respect and empathy as they share reflections on the guiding questions in Opening A. Students also focus on working to become effective learners by collaborating with peers to compare and contrast a written drama with its performance.

- The Think-Pair-Share protocol is used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- Note that the play takes place in “Jimtown, Mississippi.” If appropriate during Work Time B, explain to students that the term “Jim” as in “Jim Crow” was originally a derogatory term for black Americans. The authors of *Shuffle Along* may be calling attention to this racism directly by naming the town in this way.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- An optional Mini Language Dive, intended for use after students read and analyze “Election Day” from *Shuffle Along* during Work Time B, is available in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Release more responsibility more quickly to students as they comprehend the tasks or concepts. For example:

- Allow students who have more familiarity with musical techniques and effects to serve as mentors for their peers in identifying how these compare to the text.

- Students identifying the techniques more easily can also highlight and annotate other areas of interest in the text and share out their findings with peers.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students were introduced to the topic of the Harlem Renaissance and previewed some of the various works and genres of art that comprised the movement. In this lesson, students begin analyzing a key work from the period in detail to compare the techniques of music and text.

Support All Students

- The subject matter in this excerpt includes mention of alcohol. Continue to monitor students to determine if issues surface as a result of the content of this chapter that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually. To support students in processing this content, ask: “What habit of character did you use as you read and discussed this song?” Students may need to draw on perseverance, empathy, and compassion as they read and discuss this content, being sensitive to their own and others’ reactions.

- Students may need additional support to identify the musical techniques that impact the meaning of the text. Organize groups so that students with more experience in musical techniques can assist their less experienced peers. These lessons on music may allow some students who aren’t normally class experts to become them. However, students may need to be encouraged to generalize their knowledge of one kind of music to all music. Encourage them to draw on their homework and entrance ticket responses to do so. ▲

- Note there are differentiated versions of the Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 2 used in Opening A, the Compare Text and Music: “Election Day” questions used in Work Time B, and the Read and Analyze Blake Biography used in homework in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson provides teacher-led analysis of the scene, song, and music from *Shuffle Along’s* “Election Day.” While the text may be challenging and interpreting music techniques new to students, the teacher and peer support throughout the lesson, as well as the selected response questions which provide answer options, will help ELLs successfully participate in the analysis.

- ELLs may find it challenging to write a constructed response to synthesize the class responses analyzing the text and musical techniques. In addition to the lesson supports and those suggested below, consider creating sentence strips from the sample response from the Compare Text and Music: “Love Will Find a Way” (example for teacher reference). Then distribute the sentence strips to students who need the most support. They can work as a group to assemble the paragraph.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, 7.I.B.6, 7.I.C.10, and 7.I.C.12.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Compare Text and Music: “Election Day” handout to ensure their understanding of the relationship between the text and the musical performance.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue to practice comparing and contrasting the texts of songs with their musical performance in preparation for the Mid-Unit Assessment.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RL.7.7 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 2** by listening to the **audio recording of “Election Day” from *Shuffle Along***.

- Once students complete their entrance ticket, use a total participation technique to have students share their responses.

- Invite students who wish to share their reflections on the module guiding questions from the previous lesson’s homework. Sharing should be voluntary and supportive. Remind students to practice empathy, compassion, and respect as others share.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

- With students, use the vocabulary strategies on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart** to deconstruct the words *version* (a certain form of something), *techniques* (a method or way of doing or performing something), and *medium* (a way of communicating, such as language, music, and painting) Record these words on the **academic word wall** with translations in home languages, where appropriate, and invite students to record words in their **vocabulary logs**.

For Lighter Support

- As necessary, encourage students to orally rehearse their responses to the entrance ticket with a partner before writing. Oral rehearsal increases their confidence and achievement with speaking, listening, and writing skills.

For Heavier Support

- During Opening A, invite students to use the Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 2 ▲. This resource supports student writing and comprehension with sentence frames.

Work Time

A. Build Background Knowledge: *Shuffle Along* – RI.7.1 (10 minutes)

- Inform students that in this lesson they will begin looking more closely at the connections between art forms in the Harlem Renaissance by studying one of the most famous works made during that time, the musical *Shuffle Along*. Ask for volunteers familiar with the genre of the musicals to share what they know them. (A musical is a play with songs in it. The characters use both regular speech as well as singing and dancing to communicate with each other and tell a story.)

- Explain that the musical *Shuffle Along* was important and innovative in a variety of ways. Before students begin analyzing songs from the play, they will explore this history in a background article.

- Distribute copies of the **Harlem Renaissance packet**. Read the text aloud as students follow along silently.

- Ask students to Turn and Talk with a partner about the gist of the article. Ask for a volunteer to share that gist. (*Shuffle Along* is a musical written and performed by black Americans that influenced society and culture.)

- Use whole class participation techniques to guide discussion of the article through the following questions. Remind students to use evidence from the article in their responses:

“What are some of the reasons that is considered important? What impact did it have on musicals? What impact did it have on the culture overall?” Shuffle Along(Answers will vary but may include: *Shuffle Along* inspired many musicals like it and helped to change the art form. Also, it impacted the culture by bringing black audiences and black actors back to Broadway and desegregating theater.)

- Invite students to Turn and Talk about how the information in this article helps give context for the time period:

“How does the article help us understand what black Americans were fighting against in this time, as well as the impact their work had? What does this article suggest about the power of collaboration in creating art and starting new movements?” (Responses will vary, but may include: The article shows that black American performers had to fight against stereotypes and roles that others defined for them. *Shuffle Along* helped to change that. By bringing in new forms of music and dance, such as jazz, this musical helped to show how different forms of art could be combined to create something new and exciting.)

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time A, students may need additional support when reading the *Shuffle Along* article from the Harlem Renaissance packet. If so, pause after reading each paragraph and allow students to discuss the gist of the paragraph with a partner who needs heavier support. Breaking up the article and identifying the gist of smaller sections will help students solidify comprehension of the whole article.

- If time allows after students read the *Shuffle Along* article, challenge these students to extend the work they did with previous Language Dives by identifying one adverbial phrase in each paragraph of the article. First ask volunteers to remind students of the definition of an adverbial phrase (group of words that modify a verb, adverb, or adjective; usually tell when, where, or how). Encourage students to work in pairs to identify the adverbial phrases, what they are modifying and whether they are telling when, where, or how.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time A, students may need additional support when reading the *Shuffle Along* article from the Harlem Renaissance packet. If so, pause after reading each paragraph and allow students to discuss the gist of the paragraph with a partner who needs lighter support. Then students can highlight key words and phrases and even draw illustrations in the margins as necessary. Breaking up the article and identifying key words and phrases will help students better comprehend the whole article.

Work Time

B. Read and Analyze “Election Day” – RL.7.4 (15 minutes)

- Review appropriate learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze the impact of repetition on the first scene in *Shuffle Along*.”

“I can compare the written version of ‘Election Day’ to its audio version, analyzing the effects of techniques in each medium.”

- Tell students that they will now analyze the lyrics for the opening song of *Shuffle Along* and listen to a performance of the song to compare the two mediums of text and music. Remind students that they already previewed the song at the beginning of class but will have a chance to examine it more closely now.

- Distribute copies of **Excerpts from *Shuffle Along*** to students and allow several minutes for them to examine the text features of the first few pages. Guide students with this examination by asking them to Think-Pair-Share:

“What is the purpose of the first page? What information does it convey?” (It lists the characters.)

“Where does act 1, scene 1 take place?” (outside the hotel in the City Square in Jimtown, Mississippi) If appropriate, note that the term *Jim* as in “Jim Crow” was originally a derogatory term for black Americans. The authors of *Shuffle Along* may be calling attention to this racism directly by naming the town in this way.

“What do the words in all caps indicate? What do the words in italics indicate? What do the indented lines indicate?” If necessary, point out each kind of font so students know what the font terms refer to. (The all caps words indicate the people who are singing or speaking. The italic words show people’s actions in the scene. The indented lines show what people are singing.)

- Encourage students to record in the margins of their text the different purposes for each of the fonts. Inform students that you will read the play aloud in a Readers Theater format. Assign volunteers the roles of Jim Williams and Jessie Williams. Divide the rest of the class into groups of the Chorus, Jenkins Supports, Peck Supporters, and Walton Supporters. Read the first excerpt of the play aloud with the groups chorally reading the songs and the volunteers reading the lines.

- As a class, review the song and scene for comprehension by asking students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What is the song about?” (The song is about the people in town gathering for election day and the excitement it brings.)

“Who are the three candidates, and why do their supporters support each?” (The three candidates running are “Jenkins,” “Sam Peck,” and “Harry Walton.” Jenkins’ supporters want him to bring back alcohol to town. There are only three Sam Peck supporters, and they don’t give a clear reason why they want to elect him. Harry Walton’s supporters say that “honor is our motto” and “justice is the platform” on which they stand.)

“Who does Jim Williams support? Why?” (Jim Williams supports Harry Walton. He has known him since he was a boy and says that he has “honesty, integrity, and efficiency.”)

“What is the relationship between Jim and Jessie? Between Jessie and Harry Walton?” (Jim is Jessie’s father, and Jessie is going to marry Harry Walton.)

- Encourage students to record notes about the gist of the song and relationships between the characters in the margins of their text.

- Display and distribute **Compare Text and Music: “Election Day,”** and explain to students that they will first analyze the lyrics of “Election Day” and its literary techniques and their effects. Next, they will listen to the song and analyze the musical techniques and their effects.

- Ask students to Turn and Talk to identify words that are repeated over and over in the song. (*Election Day.*) Turn students’ attention to the first question on the Compare Text and Music: “Election Day” questions. Read aloud the question and model answering it without looking at the answers. (It shows how important the phrase is. Repetition makes the song more exciting.) Model reviewing each answer, crossing out incorrect ones and finding the correct one. (It shows that people are excited about election day.) Ask students to underline the correct answer on their own handout. As necessary, consult the **Compare Text and Music: “Election Day” (answers for teacher reference)**.

- Focus students on the second stanza of the first chorus lines. Reread the stanza and reread the following lines:

“You are thinking of the politicians whom last year you trusted,

And when they got into positions, promises they busted.”

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share about what “promises they busted” means. (Politicians broke their promises.) Turn students’ attention to the second question on the Compare Text and Music: “Election Day” questions. Read aloud the question, and use students’ responses from the sharing to generate an initial answer. (Politicians broke their promises.) Ask students to choose and underline the correct answer on their own handout. (They did not do what they said they would.)

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“Think about the context surrounding *Shuffle Along*. How might the political attitudes expressed in these lines reflect what was happening in black communities at the time the play was written?” (Responses will vary, but may include: This text was written by and for black people, and thus describes experiences that were relevant to black communities at the start of the Harlem Renaissance. Black communities were feeling frustrated and betrayed politically.)

- Focus students on the second stanza of the first chorus lines. Reread the stanza and reread the following lines:

“Although the day be dark and cold,

Still you never mind.”

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share about what the lines mean. (Even though the weather may be bad, we won’t mind.) Turn students’ attention to the third question on the Compare Text and Music: “Election Day” questions. Read aloud the question and rephrase the question. How do people feel about election day? Use total participation techniques to ask volunteers to help review each answer and finding the correct one (that people are optimistic about election day no matter what). Ask students to underline the correct answer on their own handout.

- When the class has finished answering the questions, display the blank **Techniques anchor chart**, and as a class, begin the Literary Techniques and Effects of Techniques sections by asking:

“What technique does the writer use to emphasize ideas and create excitement?” (The writer uses repetition to emphasize ideas and build excitement.)

- Record this technique and effects on the anchor chart (Literary Technique: repetition; Effects of Techniques: emphasis and create emotions). See **Techniques anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** for guidance. Inform students that they will add to this chart in the following activity and lessons.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- After students read and analyze “Election Day” from *Shuffle Along* in Work Time B, invite students to participate in a Mini Language Dive in small groups to examine the author’s use of rhyme (RL.7.4) and identify the function of a noun phrase and a relative clause (L.7.1a) in a sentence from *Shuffle Along*. This Mini Language Dive also introduces students to the structure of a compound sentence, previewing important work with a critical language standard that will be revisited later in the unit (L.7.1b).

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time B, invite students to use the Compare Text and Music: “Election Day” ▲. This resource supports student writing and comprehension with sentence frames.

- If time allows after students read the *Shuffle Along* article, work with students to extend the work they did with previous Language Dives by identifying one adverbial phrase in each paragraph of the article. First remind students of the definition of an adverbial phrase (group of words that modify a verb, adverb, or adjective; usually tell when, where, or how). Then identify an adverbial phrase in each paragraph, and ask students to tell what it is modifying and whether it is telling when, where, or how.

- Paragraph 1: “Until then,” (modifies “she had worked” and tells when)

- Paragraph 2: “After *Shuffle Along*,” (modifies “black American dance became” and tells when)

- Paragraph 3: “At the time,” (modifies “black performers were relegated” and tells when)

Closing and Assessment

A. Compare Text and Music in “Election Day” – RL.7.7 (15 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can compare the written version of ‘Election Day’ to its audio version, analyzing the effects of techniques in each medium.”

- Inform students that they will listen to the song once and make notes of their first impressions of the music on their Compare Text and Music: “Election Day” questions. Then they will listen to the song at least two more times as they answer the questions.

- Play the song “Election Day,” and invite students to Turn and Talk with their partner about the first “Music” question on the Compare Text and Music: “Election Day” questions. Ask for volunteers to share their responses.

- Read the second Music question and the answers aloud before playing the song again, so that students can focus on how the singers sing “Hooray.” Use total participation techniques to review the responses and choose the correct one. (It conveys the energy of a crowd.)

- Read the third Music question and the answers aloud before playing the song again, so that students can focus on how the singers sing “Election Day.” Use total participation techniques to review the responses and choose the correct one. (It highlights the excitement that election day brings.)

- Read aloud the constructed response question at the bottom of the Compare Text and Music: “Election Day” questions. Guide students to think about this comparison by discussing the following questions as a class:

“In what ways are the text and musical version different?” (The music includes pauses and volume changes. The text includes exclamation points but no indications that the speed or volume should change.)

“In what ways are they the same?” (Both the text and music show the excitement of election day.)

“Both the text and the music convey the same general feeling about the election. What is that feeling?” (excitement, optimism—feeling positive)

“What techniques are used in the text to show excitement?” (exclamation points, repetition, and words like *happy* and *glad*)

“What techniques are used in the song to show excitement?” (The singer pauses on the phrase “election day” and sings the word “hooray” loudly.)

- Allow students several minutes to discuss in pairs their response to the question. Students can independently record these ideas in a constructed response. Note for students that they are synthesizing their ideas from the Text and Music questions and that their constructed response should include a topic sentence, evidence of the text and music techniques and their effects, and a conclusion sentence. If necessary, write the response as a class, or draw together a group of students who need support and complete the response as a shared writing piece. ▲

- Focus students on the Techniques anchor chart. Ask students to share out from their entrance tickets, handouts, and notes the techniques and effects of the music for “Election Day.” To prompt responses, ask:

“What techniques do the singers and musicians use to add emphasis and change the feeling of the words?” (The singers shout “Hooray” and pause on the phrase “Election Day” to add emphasis and create a feeling of excitement.)

- Record and confirm student responses on the anchor chart as the discussion progresses. See the Techniques anchor chart (example for teacher reference) for guidance. If necessary, explain that *volume* is how loud the music is, *tone* is how the sound or words show feeling, and *tempo* is how fast or slow the music is. Students may also record these words in their vocabulary logs.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Read and Analyze Blake Biography

- Students read the Eubie Blake biography from their Harlem Renaissance packet and complete **Homework: Read and Analyze Blake Biography**.

For Lighter Support

- Before students leave class, ask them to read the homework assignment and, if time allows, the biography of Eubie Blake in the Harlem Renaissance packet. Then they can work with a partner to highlight the key details and to discuss their responses to the homework questions. This oral processing helps confirm comprehension and advances their speaking, listening, and writing skills.

For Heavier Support

- Before students leave class, review the homework assignment and, if time allows, the biography of Eubie Blake in the Harlem Renaissance packet. Then students can work with a partner to highlight the key details and to discuss their responses to the homework questions. Also, encourage students to use the Homework: Read and Analyze Blake Biography ▲. This resource includes sentence frames which support students in comprehension and writing.
