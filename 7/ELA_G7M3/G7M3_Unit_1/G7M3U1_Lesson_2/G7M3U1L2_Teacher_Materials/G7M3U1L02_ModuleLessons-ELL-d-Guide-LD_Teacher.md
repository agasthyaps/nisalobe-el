5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

RL.7.1, RL.7.4, SL.7.1, L.7.1a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

You are thinking of **the politicians whom last year you trusted**, and when they got into positions, promises they busted. (from *Shuffle Along* by Flournoy Miller and Aubrey Lyles)

**Lesson 2 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after students read and analyze “Election Day” from *Shuffle Along* during Work Time B.

**Rationale**

- Guiding Question and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the module guiding question (**What are some of the historical factors surrounding and contributing to the Harlem Renaissance?**) by highlighting the frustration, betrayal, and political neglect felt by black communities. This frustration and sense of urgency underlay much of the explosion of cultural expression during the Harlem Renaissance. This sentence also helps students address L.7.1a by featuring multiple phrases and clauses, including a relative clause whose function is to add information to the sentence and modify a noun, and RL.7.4 by using rhyme to create an impact in the poem. Supporting standards: RL.7.1.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it is a compound sentence with two independent clauses separated by a coordinating conjunction (**and**), it contains a relative clause (**whom last year you trusted**) that clarifies which politicians the speaker is referring to, and it features a rhyme.

- Transfer: relative clauses to clarify or add more information about key artists in the Harlem Renaissance, and compound sentences to connect related ideas in a sentence.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **You are thinking of <u>the politicians whom last year you trusted</u>, and when they got into positions, promises they busted.**

- Say:

“What is the gist of this sentence?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **the politicians whom last year you trusted**

- Ask:

“Is this chunk a phrase or a clause? How do you know?” (It is a phrase because, although it functions as a unit, it has no predicate and cannot stand alone. Students may note, however, that there is a clause, whom last year you trusted, embedded within the phrase.)

“What is the grammatical function of this phrase within the sentence?” (It is operating as a noun.)

- Invite students to replace this chunk in the sentence with other simpler nouns to better understand its function. For example, “You are thinking of **me**; you are thinking of **the cats**.”

- Draw student attention to the words **whom last year you trusted**.

“What is the function of these words in the chunk? What is their relationship to the words the politicians?” (These words make up a relative clause. They add more information about the politicians and clarify which ones we are talking about. Because the clause describes a noun, the politicians, the clause is functioning as an adjective.)

“What does this chunk suggest about how attitudes toward politicians may have changed?” (Because this chunk specifies that the addressee trusted the politicians last year, it suggests that they might not trust them now.)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **You are thinking of <u>the politicians whom last year you trusted</u>, and when they got into positions, promises they busted.**

- Ask:

“How does the rest of the sentence support the idea that attitudes toward politicians have changed?” (The rest of the sentence explain why the politicians are not trusted anymore—because they broke promises.)

“How do the rhyming words, trusted and busted, connect the ideas that attitudes toward politicians were once favorable, and now aren’t?” (The rhyming words are connected to opposite ideas, but, because they rhyme, the listener still links them.)

“Why do you think the writer chose to link two independent clauses with the word and rather than write them as two separate sentences?” (Responses will vary, but may include: the writer wanted to keep these ideas connected, rather than treat them as entirely separate thoughts.)

- Remind students of a line they read earlier in the lesson from their Harlem Renaissance packets: “*Shuffle Along* broke the mold in many ways. It was the first show to be written, produced, and performed by black writers, musicians, actors, and dancers.”

- Ask:

“Think about this context surrounding Shuffle Along. How might the political attitudes expressed in this sentence be reflective of what was happening in black communities at the time the play was written?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to point out that this text was written by and for black people, and thus describes experiences relevant to black communities at the start of the Harlem Renaissance. Black communities were feeling frustrated and betrayed politically.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the module guiding question: What are some of the historical factors surrounding and contributing to the Harlem Renaissance?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

> **I am thinking about the playwrights who \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, and**
>
> relative clause
>
> **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**
>
> independent clause

(independent clause, **and** independent clause)

- Say:

“Use this frame to give more information about the playwrights of the Harlem Renaissance, like those who wrote this play. You may include your own feelings about the playwrights in the second part of the sentence. Use your own words with your partners, and refer to your Harlem Renaissance packet as needed.”

- If productive, support students by sharing a completed example as a model, or by providing options for the first blank line, from which students can select the best answer. (e.g., . . . were the first to produce a play for desegregated audiences; . . . wrote one of the first plays associated with the Harlem Renaissance; . . . wrote *Shuffle Along*).

- Possible student answers:

> **I am thinking about the playwrights who <u>were the first to produce a play for desegregated audiences</u>, and <u>I am amazed at their perseverance and bravery</u>.**
>
> (independent clause, **and** independent clause)
