Homework: Read and Analyze Blake Biography

(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Read the Blake biography from the Harlem Renaissance packet. Then write sentences to answer the questions below.

1.  How did Blake and Sissle go against a racist practice? (RI.7.1, RI.7.2)

They refused to use blackface. Instead they wore tuxedos to perform.

2.  Why was *Shuffle Along* important for Blake and Sissle’s career? (RI.7.1, RI.7.2)

It was the first “all-black musical comedy” and it “launched many of Blake’s most enduring songs.” They were also able to create “two more hit” musicals following *Shuffle Along*.

3.  What does the story about what happened with Blake when he went to Washington show about how black Americans were treated at the time? (RI.7.1, RI.7.2)

Blake was asked to come down to perform for the president’s inauguration. But he was replaced by a white singer “at the last minute.” This shows that even black Americans as successful as Blake were discriminated against.
