<td><p><strong>The couplets each present a new idea, and the rhyme helps to show that the ideas go together and are related. Rhymes can show how an idea connects to another idea and create interesting or surprising connections. The couplets move in a direction from demand to triumph.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Contraband . . . countermand” (3–4) — both show the negative qualities of the forces that try and hold the speaker back</strong></p>
<p><strong>“heart against the ground . . . beat the dusty years” (5–6) — shows how she was held down and struggled for “years”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“stride into the morning break” (8) — shows a new beginning, waking up to a new morning</strong></p></td>

<td>How does the author or artist develop the theme? (For artwork, the theme may be communicated by different parts of the piece or the whole piece and may not develop over the course of the piece. However, details may add to or change the theme.)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>The couplets show the author’s thoughts, desires, and actions as she moves from demanding her dreams to realizing them. She begins by stating her desire, then describes her difficulties, and finally states that she is going out to achieve her dreams. This develops the theme of the importance of following dreams as it shows how the author could find great meaning in her quest. The author uses figurative language to describe the “dusty years” that the speaker was down on the “ground.” This shows the difficulty she faces. Then, the author uses figurative language such as “stride into the morning break” to show that the speaker is rising into a new day and a new hope for achieving her dreams.</strong></td>
