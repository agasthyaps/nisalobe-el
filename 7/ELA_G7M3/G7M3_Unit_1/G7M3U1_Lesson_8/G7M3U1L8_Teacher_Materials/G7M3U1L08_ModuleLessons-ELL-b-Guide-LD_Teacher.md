5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

RL.7.4, RL.7.5, SL.7.1, L.7.1a, L.7.5

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

And now, at length, **I rise, I wake!** (from the second couplet of “Calling Dreams” by Georgia Douglas Johnson)

**Lesson 8 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after students read “Calling Dreams” and analyze its structure in Work Time A.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target (**I can analyze how the structure of “Calling Dreams” contributes to its meaning**) and RL.7.4 and RL.7.5 by featuring punctuation that affects the sentence’s structure and distinguishes, highlights, and emphasizes events in the sentence. This sentence also helps students to address L.7.1a because it uses multiple phrases and clauses with distinct grammatical functions and L.7.5 because it features familiar verbs used for a figurative effect. Supporting standards: SL.7.1.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it has two independent clauses (**I rise; I wake**), whose meanings can be interpreted figuratively; it contains commas and an exclamation point that contribute to the meaning of the poem; and it features a stylistically literary prepositional phrase (**at length**) that functions as an adverb.

- Transfer: Students apply their developing understanding of the poem to a Closing and Assessment activity that tracks its theme and to a homework assignment that asks synthesis questions about the poem.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **And now, at length,** **<u>I rise, I wake!</u>**

- Encourage students to practice reading the sentence aloud with their partners.

“What do you notice about the way this sentence sounds when it is read aloud? How does the punctuation guide your reading of the sentence?” (Responses may vary, but look for students to notice that the commas add pauses, which give the sentence a rhythmic effect. The exclamation point adds energy to the sentence.)

- Say:

“What is this sentence about?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **I rise, I wake!**

- Say:

“How many independent clauses are in this chunk? How do you know they are independent clauses?” (There are two independent clauses: I rise and I wake. They are independent because they contain a subject, a verb, and a complete thought.)

“In what contexts do we typically expect to encounter or use the verbs rise or wake?” (When we are talking about coming out of sleep.)

“Does this poem describe a person who was sleeping? What is the person in the poem doing or speaking about?” (The poem does not describe a sleeping person. The person in the poem is demanding that life give them the right to pursue his or her dreams.)

“How can we interpret the verbs rise and wake figuratively in this sentence?” (Responses may vary, but look for students to understand that rise and wake can be used to describe some sort of epiphany or awakening. The person in the poem is feeling a new sense of energy.)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **And now, at length, <u>I rise, I wake!</u>**

- Say:

“What is the grammatical function of the phrase and now in this sentence? How do you know?” (It is functioning as an adverb because it is giving more information about when the actions of rising and waking happen.)

“What is the meaning of the phrase at length in this poem? What clues help you understand its meaning?” (At length means after a long period of time. Responses about clues may vary, but look for students to notice that length implies an amount of time or that the phrase resembles a more familiar expression, at last, which has a similar meaning.)

“What is the grammatical function of the phrase at length in this sentence? How do you know?” (It is functioning as an adverb because it is giving more information about how the actions of rising and waking take place.)

- If time allows, reinforce students’ understanding of the phrases **and now** and **at length** as adverbs by inviting students to substitute those phrases with other more familiar adverbs, like **finally**, **happily**, or **at last**.

- Say:

“How does the structure of these short clauses and phrases help to convey the way a person in this poem is feeling?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to notice that the person in the poem is feeling a new, galvanized sense of energy and determination. The short phrases and clauses, which are separated by pauses when read aloud, give the sentence a feeling of rhythmic energy.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target:  
I can analyze how the structure of “Calling Dreams” contributes to its meaning?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, I \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, I \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_!**

adverb adverb verb verb

- Say:

“Use this frame to describe something you imagine yourself doing. Be creative and use your own words.”

- If productive, provide students who need heavier support with adverb phrases to choose from to fill in the first two lines (e.g., and then; immediately; after waiting for a long time; with a smile).

- Possible student answers:

> **<u>At once</u>, <u>without warning</u>, I <u>jump</u>, I <u>sing</u>!**
>
> (adverb, adverb, independent clause, independent clause)
