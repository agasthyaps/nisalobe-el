A theme of Georgia Douglas Johnson’s poem “Calling Dreams” is that with determination you can overcome obstacles and realize your dreams. The poet develops this theme through structure and language. The rhyming couplets show the speaker’s thoughts, desires, and actions as she moves from demanding her dreams to realizing them. She begins by stating her desire, then describes her difficulties, and finally states that she is going out to achieve her dreams. This develops the theme of the importance of following dreams as it shows how the author could find great meaning in her quest. The poet uses figurative language to describe the “dusty years” that the speaker was down on the “ground.” This shows the difficulty she faces. Next, the poet uses figurative language such as “stride into the morning break” to show that the speaker is rising into a new day and a new hope for achieving her dreams. Together the structure and language develop the theme that with determination you can realize your dreams.
