11. What are some of the ways Johnson was connected to other artists of the Harlem renaissance? (RI.7.1, RI.7.2)

Answers will vary, but may include: Johnson published in some of the same magazines as other writers and was “swept up in the cultural high tide of the Harlem Renaissance.” She also held a “popular art salon” where writers from the Harlem Renaissance came to share ideas.

12. Why is her publication in *Harper’s* and *Century* notable? What does it show about black American writers at the time? (RI.7.1, RI.7.2)

Her publication in *Harper’s* and *Century* was notable because she was “among the first black writers” to be published there. This showed that black American writers were not published frequently in “white mainstream publications” like those magazines.
