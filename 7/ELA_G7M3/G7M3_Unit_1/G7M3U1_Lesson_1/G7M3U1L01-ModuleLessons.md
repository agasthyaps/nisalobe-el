Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- L.7.4 – Opening A: On an entrance ticket, students use strategies to determine the meaning of words and phrases.

- RL.7.1 – Work Time A: Students use evidence from literary texts to infer the topic of the module.

- RI.7.1 – Work Time A: Students use evidence from informational texts to infer the topic of the module.

- SL.7.1 – Work Time B: Students use the Think-Pair-Share protocol to engage in collaborative discussions about the performance task and the guiding questions for the module.

- RI.7.1 – Closing and Assessment A: Students explore the anchor text for initial noticings and listen to the introduction from Grimes’ *One Last Word*, analyzing and discussing what the text says explicitly about the Harlem Renaissance.

- The racism, oppression, and racial violence referred to in the book may be sensitive for students, and some students may connect with these issues personally and deeply. After exploring the text, provide students with time to reflect. Monitor students, and determine if issues surface that need to be discussed in more detail as a whole group, in smaller groups, or independently. Reflections may be personal, and students are not required to share them. Provide background information and discussion on racism, oppression, and racial violence, if necessary.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become ethical people by showing respect and empathy as they share reflections on the text. They also focus on becoming effective learners by collaborating and taking initiative on the Gallery Walk.

- The Gallery Walk and Think-Pair-Share protocols are used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- Throughout this module, *black people* and *black Americans* are used as they are most inclusive. If a text uses another term, that term will be discussed and explained as necessary.

- This lesson is the first that includes built-out instruction for the use of Goal 4 Conversation Cues. Goal 4 Conversation Cues help students think with others to expand the conversation. Refer to the Online Resources for the complete set of cues. Examples of the Goal 4 Conversation Cues used in this module include the following:

- To prompt students to compare:

“How is what \_\_\_\_\_ said the same as/different from what \_\_\_\_\_ said?”

- To prompt students to agree, disagree, and explain why:

“Do you agree or disagree with what your classmate said? Why?”

- To prompt students to add on to classmates’ comments:

“Who can add on to what your classmate said?”

- To prompt students to explain:

“Who can explain why your classmate came up with that response?”

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release more responsibility more quickly to students as they comprehend the tasks or concepts.

- Allow those students who have background knowledge of the Harlem Renaissance and who are recording their notices and wonders in the Gallery Walk quickly to develop ideas about how the art, songs, and texts are related by theme.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Students have used resources to infer the topic in Modules 1 and 2. This lesson will build on those foundations by encouraging them to use resources to infer the topic of the module.

Support All Students

- At this point, students should be independently reading the texts in the Gallery Walk and questions on the entrance ticket. Read the entrance ticket aloud to students as needed. If some students need more support, partner them to move through the Gallery Walk in pairs. Consider pairing English language learners with a partner who has more advanced or native language proficiency. The partner with greater language proficiency can serve as a model in the pair, initiating discussions, reading the texts aloud, summarizing the texts, and providing implicit sentence frames, for example. ▲

- Partners may also quietly discuss the content with one another as a tool for communication, and may note-take for students as needed. Alternatively, provide choices around how to read (with a partner, alone, or with technology such as an audiobook). Offer small group instruction on chunking each subsection of a text into paragraphs, and noting the gist of each paragraph on a sticky note. ▲

- Note there are differentiated versions of the Infer the Topic: I Notice/I Wonder note-catcher used in Work Time A and the Homework: Song Analysis used in homework in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- The subject matter in the Gallery Walk includes references to race and racism. Continue to monitor students to determine if issues surface as a result of the content of this module that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually. To support students in processing this content, ask: “What habit of character did you use as you read and discussed these materials?” Students may need to draw on perseverance, empathy, compassion as they read and discuss this content, being sensitive to their own and others’ reactions to the information presented.

- Students may need additional support with developing background information on the Harlem Renaissance. Provide a brief synopsis of the content of each station in the Gallery Walk to support students with initial background knowledge and general comprehension. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson provides students with the opportunity to work with others to generate useful background knowledge about the Harlem Renaissance, which they may not have in English and will need to use throughout the module.

- ELLs may find it challenging to fill out the note-catcher independently if they do not know the English words for the ideas and concepts they have inferred. Therefore, allowing them to fill out the note-catcher in their native language or with a partner may be helpful. Also, the module topic and anchor text require some background knowledge about black American history. The anchor text gives a lot of this background information, but all students, and especially ELLs, may need key information highlighted. Create a Harlem Renaissance chart with rows for *who, what, where, when, why,* and *how*. Then spend some time at the beginning or end of class filling in details. This chart can also be used to support students in their understanding and synthesis of the biographies they read throughout the module.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, and 7.I.B.6.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Infer the Topic: I Notice/I Wonder note-catcher and map of Harlem to ensure students infer what the module is about and use evidence from the texts to build their knowledge.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students begin reading and analyzing the book and songs from the musical *Shuffle Along*.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.7.4 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 1**.

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique to review their responses. Refer to **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 1 (answers for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

- If feasible, host individual reading check-ins with ELLs before they begin Module 3 reading. During these meetings, work with students to identify their reading strengths, as well as pinpoint areas of possible growth. Help students develop action plans for working toward their goals. Plan to meet with students again at the beginning of the next module to track their progress and adjust goals as needed. This process supports a growth mindset for developing readers and facilitates opportunities for students to take charge of their own learning.

For Heavier Support

- If feasible, host individual reading check-ins with ELLs before they begin Module 3 reading. Before these meetings, create a list of clear and specific statements that students can use to help them pinpoint their strengths and areas of growth. Students can use a 1-5 scale to express the extent to which they believe the statements apply to them. These statements might include the following:

- I can read quickly in English and still understand what I read.

- I enjoy reading in English.

- I enjoy reading in other languages.

- I understand most words I read in class.

- I know how to determine the meaning of words I don’t know.

- I feel comfortable using a dictionary.

- I can usually determine the central idea of what I read.

Work Time

A. Infer the Topic – RL.7.1, RI.7.1 (15 minutes)

- Review appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can infer the topic of this module from the resources.”

- Focus students on the **Infer the Topic resources** posted around the room.

- Distribute the **Infer the Topic: I Notice/I Wonder note-catchers**. Focus students on the question at the top and read it aloud:

“What do you think you will be learning about in this module?”

- Tell students that the purpose of the note-catcher is to take notes to help them remember their thinking. It isn’t something they will hand in for assessment, so they can record in pictures or words. They do not need to write in full sentences.

- Be transparent about why students are noticing and wondering (because it is a helpful way to understand and explore a new topic or text).

- Remind students that they used the Infer the Topic protocol in previous modules, and review as necessary using the **Directions for Infer the Topic**. (Refer to the Classroom Protocols document located on the Tools Page: http://eled.org/tools for the full version of the protocol.)

- Guide students through the protocol. Allow them to choose what resources to observe, so those who may not be able to read independently have the option to view an image. Mixed-proficiency pairs can choose the resources they want to observe and begin by discussing what the text means. Encourage students to agree or disagree with one another about what the text means using sentence frames. Examples: “I agree because \_\_\_\_\_.” “I disagree because \_\_\_\_\_.” ▲

- Refocus whole group. Think-Pair-Share:

“Now that you have looked at some resources, what do you think this module might be about?” (Responses will vary, but could include: black history.)

“Can you say more about that? I’ll give you some time to think and write or sketch.” (Responses will vary.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- Before releasing students to infer the topic in Work Time A, do a think-aloud and infer a few-but not all-aspects of the topic from the anchor text cover picture to model the inferring activity for students and get them started. Modeling supports ELLs by giving them a preview of the kind of language they will need to use to complete the activity independently or with a partner. For example:

- “I notice several people of color. I wonder if the Harlem Renaissance has to do with people of color. I notice there are lots of buildings as if it’s a city. I wonder if the Harlem Renaissance has to do with a city.”

- In Work Time A, students will use the language chunk “I wonder . . . ” To deepen students’ understanding of language structures, explain that this chunk begins a statement that is really asking a question. Give a few examples of “I wonder” statements and invite volunteers to do so as well, recording the statements on the board (e.g., “I wonder what this is a picture of. I wonder who this person is. I wonder where they are”). Note how a question word often follows the “I wonder . . . ” chunk but then a noun or pronoun follows the question word, then a verb. Leave the example statements on the board for students to consult as they make their own “I wonder” statements throughout the work time.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time A, invite students to use the Infer the Topic: I Notice/I Wonder note-catcher ▲. This resource features more specific questions and sentence starters which hone student attention and reduce cognitive overload.

- In Work Time A, pair newcomers with other students who speak their native language, and allow them to infer the topic in their native language. This practice supports ELLs by giving an opportunity to express ideas more fluently, quickly, and deeply than they may be able to in English, and also affirms the classes’ respect for their native language. Encouraging pairs to work in their native language to report out in English also helps to foster bilingualism.

Work Time

B. Introduce the Performance Task and the Module Guiding Questions – SL.7.1 (10 minutes)

- Direct students’ attention to the **Performance Task anchor chart**, and read the task aloud.

- As students may be overwhelmed by the Performance Task anchor chart, assure them that they will continue to explore the meaning of the chart in subsequent lessons and units.

- Turn and Talk:

“What do you notice?” (We will create a museum about the Harlem Renaissance.)

“What do you wonder?” (Responses will vary, but may include: Why is the Harlem Renaissance important?)

“Now that you have analyzed the performance task, has your inference of what this module might be about changed? How?” (Responses will vary.)

- Clarify anything pertinent to this specific performance task. Consider displaying a model performance task from a former student. Ask students to make connections between the model and the performance task.

- Direct students’ attention to the **Module Guiding Questions anchor chart**, and read the questions aloud.

- Turn and Talk:

“Why do we have guiding questions for each module?” (Responses will vary, but may include: to help focus our learning, to help us think about the performance task.)

- Underline the word *collaboration*.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What does this mean? What strategy can you use to find out?” (a cooperative effort by which people or organizations work together to accomplish a common project or mission)

- Repeat with the words *contributing* (giving for a purpose) and *legacies* (items passed down from ancestors or someone who came before).

- Add the new words to the **academic word wall**, including translations in home languages, and invite students to add the words to their **vocabulary logs**.

- Tell students that these are the questions that will guide their thinking and learning throughout the module. Turn and Talk:

“What do you notice about these questions?” (Responses will vary, but may include: Collaboration and historical factors impacted the Harlem Renaissance.)

“What do you wonder about these questions?” (Responses will vary, but may include: What was occurring at the time to create a renaissance?)

“Now that you have analyzed the guiding questions and performance task, has your inference of what this module might be about changed?” (Responses will vary.)

“How is what \_\_\_\_\_ said the same as/different from what \_\_\_\_\_ said? I’ll give you time to think and write.” (Responses will vary.)

- Clarify that this module will be about the Harlem Renaissance, which occurred in Harlem, New York, between 1918 and the mid to late 1930s. Provide students with the definition of the Harlem Renaissance:

“Between 1918 and the mid to late 1930s, an explosion of African American music, art, and literature occurred in Harlem.”

- Add *Harlem Renaissance* to the **domain-specific word wall** with translations in home languages where appropriate, and invite students to add the phrase to their vocabulary logs.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What does this topic mean to you at this point? Why might it be meaningful to study this topic?” (Responses will vary, but may include: This topic has to do with the explosion of African American music, art, and literature in Harlem between 1918 and the mid to late 1930s. It might be meaningful to study because there are lessons we can learn from history that are still relevant today.)

“From what you know so far, what are you looking forward to about this topic?” (Responses will vary, but may include: I am excited to look at the art and listen to the music from that time.)

- Acknowledge that some students may already know something about this topic. Explain that for homework, they will reflect on the guiding questions and how they feel about them based on their own experiences, and that this will be discussed more at the beginning of the next lesson. And note that some students may know nothing about the topic—it will be fun to dig in together!

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time B, students will use the language chunk “I wonder . . . ” To deepen students’ understanding of language structures, explain that this chunk begins a statement that is really asking a question. Give a few examples of “I wonder” statements and invite volunteers to do so as well, recording the statements on the board (e.g., “I wonder what this is a picture of. I wonder who this person is. I wonder where they are”). Note how a question word often follows the “I wonder . . . ” chunk but then a noun or pronoun follows the question word, then a verb. Leave the example statements on the board for students to consult as they make their own “I wonder” statements throughout the work time.

Closing and Assessment

A. Introduce the Anchor Text: *One Last Word* – RI.7.1 (15 minutes)

- Distribute Nikki Grimes’ book, ***One Last Word: Wisdom from the Harlem Renaissance*** and ask students to form triads and explore the book together by flipping through and noting the sections, the images, and perhaps how the Grimes poems are related to the other poems.

- After several minutes, ask volunteers to share what they noticed. Ensure that students notice that the book is a collection of poems from the Harlem Renaissance that inspired Grimes to write new poems and inspired artists to create art. If necessary, call attention to the biographies of the poets and artists and the introduction.

- Ask students to turn to the introduction, titled “The Harlem Renaissance,” on pages 2–4. As students follow along, read aloud the first two paragraphs on page 2, then ask students to Think-Triad-Share:

“When did the Harlem Renaissance occur?” (Between 1918 and the mid to late 1930s.)

“Why did the Harlem Renaissance occur?” (During the Great Migration, millions of African Americans left the South in search of a better life. Many of them settled in Harlem where they could be free and express themselves.)

“Who were some important artists and writers during the Harlem Renaissance?” (James Weldon Johnson, Josephine Baker, Aaron Douglas, Arna Bontemps, Countee Cullen, Zora Neale Hurston, Georgia Douglas Johnson, Jean Toomer, Langston Hughes, Gwendolyn Bennett, Clara Ann Thompson, Anna Spencer, W.E.B. Du Bois, and Jesse Redmon Fauset.)

- Direct students’ attention to the Module Guiding Questions anchor chart. Inform students that the first few paragraphs have already touched on some of the answers to the guiding questions, and the next few paragraphs will continue to do so. Encourage students to follow along and consider the guiding questions as the rest of the introduction is read aloud. Ask students to Think-Triad-Share:

“How can collaboration influence an artistic renaissance?” (W.E.B. Du Bois and Jessie Redmon Fauset worked together on *Fire!!; Opportunity: A Journal of Negro Life and Crisis*. Artists and writers gathered together in Harlem to create.)

- If students need support answering this question, ask:

“Who worked together during the Harlem Renaissance? How did their collaboration help them and other artists?” ▲

“What are some of the historical factors surrounding and contributing to the Harlem Renaissance?” (Slavery, Jim Crow laws in the South, violence from the Ku Klux Klan, lynchings, and the Great Migration.)

- If students need support answering this question, ask:

“What important historical events were happening before and during the Harlem Renaissance? How were African Americans treated before and during the Harlem Renaissance?” ▲

- Remind students to practice empathy, compassion, and respect with their classmates as they reflect on and share about these difficult topics. Sharing should be voluntary and supportive.

“What are some of the lasting legacies of the Harlem Renaissance?” (“Lift Every Voice and Sing” is still sung today. The themes of the Harlem Renaissance—that we define ourselves, set our own paths, celebrate our capabilities, and determine our own destiny, no matter what obstacles are placed in our way—are still important today. Having the character traits of toughness, survival, and a positive attitude continue to matter.)

- If students need support answering this question, ask:

“What Harlem Renaissance works are still remembered and celebrated today? What Harlem Renaissance themes are still important today?” ▲

- Invite students to notice the Harlem Renaissance Museum Collection area in the classroom. Tell students that over the course of the module, important images and texts from the Harlem Renaissance will be added to the museum collection. From it students will draw pieces for their performance task exhibits and other museum exhibits they will practice creating over the course of the module.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Read and Reflect

- Students read and reflect on the guiding questions for the module in **Homework: Module Guiding Questions** and discuss them with their families. They should consider how the guiding questions make them feel. They can sketch or write about their ideas.

B. Song Analysis

- Students listen to their favorite song and read the lyrics. Then they respond to a prompt on **Homework: Song Analysis**.

For Lighter Support

- Before students leave class, ask them to read the homework assignments and discuss them with a partner. Encourage students to spend time brainstorming vocabulary and language structures to describe how the music impacts meaning.

For Heavier Support

- Before students leave class, review the homework assignments and ensure students understand that they should discuss the essential questions with a family member. Then they listen to a favorite song and write about how the music and singing make meaning. Encourage students to use the Homework: Song Analysis ▲. This resource includes sentence frames which support students in comprehension and writing. Use pantomime and examples to ensure students understand words like *soft, loud, fast, slow, high, low,* and *feeling*. If possible, play a song and model completing the frames to analyze the song.
