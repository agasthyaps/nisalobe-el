![](media/image1.png) Guiding Questions and Big Ideas

How does collaboration influence an artistic renaissance?

- *Innovation occurs through collaboration and community.*

- *The academic mindset of belonging is a critical aspect to creating a common identity and strong community during the Harlem Renaissance.*

- *There are common themes, practices, and structures across the art, music, and literature of the Harlem Renaissance.*

What will your student be doing at school?

Students will begin Unit 1 by reading songs and scenes from the musical theater show *Shuffle Along*[^1], which was a wildly popular production that was the first to portray black Americans in non-comedic roles. The show was so popular and influential that President Harry S. Truman used a song from it for his election campaign. Written through the collaboration of four talented black American writers and composers, *Shuffle Along* gives students the opportunity to examine an important text, compare it with musical versions of the songs, and begin to explore the idea of collaboration, which is central to the Harlem Renaissance.

For the mid-unit assessment, students will read “Lift Every Voice and Sing,”[^2] the poem by James Weldon Johnson. In the assessment, students will analyze the poem and compare it to the song version, noting how the language and musical techniques develop themes such as persevering through difficult times. Students close the assessment lesson with an all-class analysis of Augusta Savage’s sculpture *The Harp*, which was inspired by Johnson’s poem and created for the 1939 World’s Fair in New York. Examining the poem, song, and sculpture versions of “Lift Every Voice and Sing” helps students truly understand the nature of collaboration in the Harlem Renaissance.

In the second half of the unit, students read several poems in the module’s anchor text *One Last Word: Wisdom from the Harlem Renaissance*[^3] by Nikki Grimes. This text is a collection of poems from Harlem Renaissance poets paired with contemporary poems by Nikki Grimes and artwork by contemporary artists. Poems students read include “The Negro Speaks of Rivers” by Langston Hughes and “Calling Dreams” and “Hope” by Georgia Douglas Johnson. In order to better understand the poets’ messages about connections to the past and working hard to achieve dreams, students analyze the poems’ structure, such as rhyme and repetition. Students also analyze figurative language, such as metaphors, similes, and allusions to mythical or biblical references. Finally, students analyze themes such as how thinking about the past can give us hope in the present and how with determination people can achieve their dreams.

For the end of unit assessment, students test their skill of poetry analysis by exploring the poem “I Shall Return” by Claude McKay, which is about the longing for one’s home. Students end the unit with a collaborative discussion in which they explore the similarities in themes across all the works of the unit, further enhancing the idea of collaboration in the Harlem Renaissance.

Central to the EL Education curriculum is a focus on “habits of character” and social-emotional learning. Students work to become effective learners, developing mindsets and skills for success in college, career, and life (e.g., initiative, responsibility, perseverance, collaboration); to become ethical people, treating others well and standing up for what is right (e.g., empathy, integrity, respect, compassion); and to contribute to a better world, putting their learning to use to improve communities (e.g., citizenship, service).

In this unit, students focus on respect, empathy, and compassion as they respond to one another’s ideas and skills in written work and in discussions. Students also practice collaboration and taking initiative during discussions. They practice integrity and perseverance as they work independently on assessments. And they take responsibility for their own learning as they track progress on their assessments. Students also explore how the writers, artists, and musicians of the Harlem Renaissance supported one another and practiced collaboration in creating their works.

How can you support your student at home?

Explore with your student music, poems, and art. Discuss how artists and writers create meaning through musical, literary, and artistic techniques such as:

- Music: volume (amount of sound), tone (the sound of words as they show a feeling), tempo (the speed of music)

- Poems: repetition (writing or saying things over and over), metaphors (comparisons between two different things to explain something in a new and interesting way), rhyme (words that end with the same or almost the same sound as another word), allusions (an indirect reference to another work such as the Bible or mythical texts), structure (how a text is organized), connotations (the “extra” meaning that surrounds words; used to create tone)

- Art: position and movement of figures (where people are in relation to each other and whether and how they seem to move), use of light and color (how light, shadow, and color work in the piece), symbolism (expressing ideas with objects)

You may use questions such as the following for your conversations:

- What do you notice about how the poem or song lyrics are structured? Is there a rhyme pattern? Is there repetition? Are the lines long or short? How many stanzas are there?

- How does the structure affect meaning? Does the rhyme show how ideas are connected? Does the repetition emphasize ideas? Do the stanzas build on each other or introduce new ideas?

- What figurative language is in the song or poem (e.g., metaphors, allusions—see bullets above)? What does the figurative language mean? What two things are being compared? What bigger idea does that comparison convey?

- What musical techniques do the singers and musicians use (e.g., volume, tone, tempo—see bullets above)? What mood or overall feeling does the music create? How does it create this feeling? Is the music slow or fast? Are the notes high or low? Is the music loud or soft?

- What do you notice in the artwork? Are there people or figures? What are they doing? What do they look like? How are they positioned in relation to each other? What might the artist be saying with these figures? Are the colors light or dark? What might the artist be saying with these colors?

Unit 1: Homework

In Lesson 1, students read the module guiding questions (listed above) and discuss them with a family member, talking about how the questions make them feel and why, and what the questions make them think about. Students can sketch or write their reflections.

In Lesson 1, students listen to their favorite song and analyze the lyrics by responding to the prompt, “How do the music, techniques, and singing impact the meaning?”

In Lessons 2, 5–6, and 10–11, students read and analyze biographies of the artists and writers whose works they analyze throughout the unit.

In Lessons 7–9, students answer selected and constructed response questions to analyze the structure, language, and themes in poems in preparation for their end of unit assessment.

In Lessons 5–12, homework focuses on research reading for which students read a topic-related book of choice and answer a question related to the unit’s ideas and skills.

Research Reading: When not reading their anchor text, your student is expected to independently research the topic by reading topic-related books of his or her choice for approximately 20 minutes each day and responding to a prompt of choice in the front of the independent reading journal. These are usually books your student will bring home from school; however, they may be topic-related books chosen by the student at the public or your home library. Prompts for independent reading can be found in the homework materials provided below.

Independent Reading

**Directions:** Remember to record responses to research reading in the front of your independent reading journal and responses to choice reading in the back. Try to choose a different prompt each time.

Record any new vocabulary in your vocabulary log. Underline vocabulary found during independent reading.

**Record:**

- Date

- Title and author of your reading book

- Pages you have read

- Prompt

- Response

**Example:**

<u>Date:</u> 01/30/19

<u>Book Title and Author:</u> “Harlem Renaissance Packet” by EL Education

<u>Pages Read:</u> N/A

<u>Prompt:</u> How did the artists, musicians, and writers interact with each other? How did this collaboration affect their work?

<u>Response:</u> The authors of *Shuffle Along* collaborated to create the story, music, and lyrics of the show. They also collaborated with actors and musicians to perform the show. This collaboration produced a musical that was so popular it changed musical theater forever by combining a story with music and dance.

**Consider using the following independent reading prompts.**[^4]

- Who were the important people involved in this movement? What impact did they have on the movement?

- How did the artists, musicians, and writers interact with each other? How did this collaboration affect their work?

- What are some historical factors surrounding this time period? How did these historical factors influence the artists, musicians, and writers and their work?

- What is the legacy of the Harlem Renaissance? How has it impacted art, music, and literature today?

- Choose one new word from your reading today and analyze it on a vocabulary square.

| **Definition in your own words**                  | **Synonyms** (words with the same meaning**)** |
|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Words with the same affix or root**             | **Sketch**                                     |
| **Translation in home language** (if appropriate) |                                                |

Vocabulary

**Directions:** In the classroom, you have been recording words from your texts in your vocabulary log. Throughout this unit, you have been reading topic-related books at home to build your knowledge of epidemics and recording words in your independent reading journal.

Choose a word from your research reading or from a text you’ve read in class and add the word to your vocabulary log. Try to choose a different word to add and to practice a different vocabulary strategy each time. For each word, be sure to add the following:

1.  The definition, or meaning, of the word

<!-- -->

3.  The vocabulary strategy you used to figure out the meaning of the word

4.  A sketch or diagram that helps you to better understand the meaning of the word

Record new vocabulary in vocabulary logs and mark academic vocabulary with a symbol, for example, a star:

- Academic vocabulary: words you might find in informational texts on many different topics. For example, the words *evidence* and *rationale* are words that could be found in books on any topic.

- Domain-specific vocabulary: words about a particular topic. For example, the words *tadpoles*, *frogspawn*, and *amphibian* are some that would be found on the topic of frogs.

**Vocabulary Strategies**

As a reminder, the vocabulary strategies we’ve been working on in class are listed below:

- Context: Read the sentence around the word.

- Look at the affixes for clues.

- Look at the root of the word for clues.

- Use a dictionary.

- Discuss the word with another person (after attempting some of the above strategies).

[^1]: Some scenes and characters in *Shuffle Along* are from the vaudeville era and may reinforce stereotypes of black Americans. For this reason, students will not read these scenes and only focus on the ones between the romantic leads.

[^2]: The poem “Lift Every Voice and Sing” makes reference to the violence and oppression of black Americans’ past.

[^3]: Some of the poems in the collection may be too mature for students and are not read in this curriculum. Those that are read make reference to the violence toward and oppression of black Americans.

[^4]: Some of the prompts will not be appropriate for the text students are reading. Invite students to choose a prompt that works for the text they have just read.
