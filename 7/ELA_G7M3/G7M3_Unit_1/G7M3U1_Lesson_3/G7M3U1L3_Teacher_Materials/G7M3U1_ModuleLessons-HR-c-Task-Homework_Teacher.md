“Love Will Find a Way”

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Write a constructed response to the following prompt:

What techniques do the author and musicians use to impact meaning in “Love Will Find a Way”? (RL.7.7)

The song “Love Will Find a Way” is about the power of love to bring people through difficulties. The author of the lyrics uses figurative language to develop this idea. For example, he writes that the couple’s love is a “heav’nly beacon” that guides them through “darkest night.” This shows that the love has the power to bring people through difficulties. The singer also develops these ideas with his techniques. He sings slowly and in a passionate voice to show his feelings. He also slows down his singing even more at times and repeats certain lines. This shows his faith in the power of love.
