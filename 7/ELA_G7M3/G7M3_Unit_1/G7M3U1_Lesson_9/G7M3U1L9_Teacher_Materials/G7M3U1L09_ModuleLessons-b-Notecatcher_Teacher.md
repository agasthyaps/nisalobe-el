<p><strong>How does structure</strong></p>
<p><strong>(including rhyme and repetition) contribute to meaning?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each stanza develops an idea about how difficult times do not last forever. The first stanza reminds the reader that “all things pass away; . . . there must be day!” In the second stanza, the author uses the idea of an oak tree growing from a seed to show it takes time to realize your true self. The last stanza talks about large amounts of time like “seasons” and “ages long done” to show that it takes time for everyone “his hour—to dwell in the sun.”</strong></p></td>
<td><p><strong>Language</strong></p>
<p><strong>How does the language (including word choice and figurative language) in the poem influence meaning?</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Shadows are flecked by the rose sifting through”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Meaning: even shadows have other pretty colors like rose in them.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Purpose: to show that darkness still has hope in it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“The oak tarries long in the depths of the seed”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Meaning: the tree is a seed for a long time before it becomes a tree.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Purpose: to show that things in nature must be patient before they grow and become what they are meant to be.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“We move to the rhythm of ages long done”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Meaning: we are affected by the long ago past.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Purpose: to show how the time that affects us spans a long time.</strong></p></td>
