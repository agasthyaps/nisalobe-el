<td><p><strong>Each stanza develops an idea about how difficult times do not last forever. The first stanza reminds the reader that “all things pass away; . . . there must be day!” (3–4) In the second stanza, the author uses the idea of an oak tree growing from a seed to show it takes time to realize your true self. The last stanza talks about large amounts of time like “seasons” and “ages long done” to show that it takes time for everyone “his hour—to dwell in the sun.” (12)</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Shadows are flecked by the rose sifting through” (2) Meaning: even shadows have other pretty colors like rose in them Purpose: to show that darkness still has hope in it</strong></p>
<p><strong>“The oak tarries long in the depths of the seed” (5) Meaning: the tree is a seed for a long time before it becomes a tree Purpose: to show that things in nature must be patient before they grow and become what they are meant to be</strong></p>
<p><strong>“We move to the rhythm of ages long done” (11) Meaning: we are affected by the longago past Purpose: to show how the time that affects us spans a long time</strong></p></td>

<td>How does the author or artist develop the theme? (For artwork, the theme may be communicated by different parts of the piece or the whole piece and may not develop over the course of the piece. However, details may add to or change the theme.)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>The author structures the poem in three stanzas, which each show that with time things get better, or hope can be found. The author also uses figurative language to develop this theme. She writes that “shadows are flecked by the rose” which means that even dark times contain an element of beauty. She also reminds readers that “the oak tarries long in the depths of the seed,” which is a way of reminding readers that they must be patient during difficult times.</strong></td>
