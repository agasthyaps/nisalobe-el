Answers will vary, but may include: Augusta Savage collaborated with many artists during the Harlem Renaissance. She created the Savage Studio of Arts and Crafts. This helped to educate adults in the arts. She served as director of the Harlem Community Arts Center. This center helped others to learn about black American culture through fine arts. Savage was a member of the “306 Group.” In this group, she shared techniques and ideas with important artists like Charles Alston, Romare Bearden, Jacob Lawrence, and Morgan and Marvin Smith. In all these ways, Savage collaborated with and influenced artists and they, in turn, influenced her.

12. How do the statue, the poem, and the performance versions of “Lift Every Voice and Sing” use different techniques to develop a similar theme? (RL.7.2, RL.7.7)

Answers will vary, but may include: (1). The poem, song, and sculpture “Lift Every Voice and Sing” show the theme that working together people can create or celebrate something beautiful despite difficulties. In the poem, Johnson repeats “us” and “we” to emphasize collaboration. He also uses figurative language to develop the theme. For example, the speaker tells of “our weary feet” coming to “the place for which our fathers sighed”  
(2). This shows the theme that together they have overcome difficulties and made it to a good place. In the song, the singers also emphasize collaboration when they sing together as one voice, raising and lowering their volume together and pausing on words together. This shows the theme of collaboration to make something beautiful. Finally, in the sculpture, Savage shows collaboration in all the human figures joined and working together like a musical instrument. All three works show the theme of celebrating or creating beautiful music.
