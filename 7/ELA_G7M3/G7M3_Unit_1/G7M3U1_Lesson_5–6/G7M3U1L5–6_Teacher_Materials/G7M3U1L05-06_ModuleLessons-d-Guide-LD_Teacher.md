Deconstruct

- **Out**

“What does the word out mean in this chunk? Does it connect to another line in the song?” (Out means away from; it connects to the verb phrase have come in the previous line of the stanza, telling us that black Americans have come out or away from something. Have escaped is another way to say have come out from.) (adverb)

- **the gloomy past**

“What have they come out from? What word(s) help you figure this out?” (They have come out from the gloomy past. Gloomy means dark and depressing, with little hope. Black Americans have come out from really dark and difficult times.)  
(adjective + noun = noun phrase)

Deconstruct

- **Till**

“What does the word till tell us?” (Till is another, more informal, way to say until. Till connects this chunk to the previous chunks and signals a time relationship between them. It tells us the information in the previous chunks \[having come out from the gloomy past\] happened up until the information in this chunk \[now we stand at last\].) (subordinating conjunction)

- **we**

“Who is this chunk about?” (We refers to the speakers in the poem, who struggled and were oppressed in the gloomy past.) (pronoun)

“What does this chunk tell us? Is the meaning of this chunk literal or figurative?” (This chunk tells us that the speakers in the poem now stand at last. Stand is used figuratively to signal hope, telling us that the speakers in the song are finally able to stand away from the gloomy past and create a new sense of hope and freedom for themselves.)

is cast.

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Ask:

“What does this chunk tell us?” (Where the speakers in the poem stand at last that creates a new sense of hope after dark and difficult times.)

- **cast**

“What does the word cast mean?” (Cast means to make light appear somewhere; it tells us the speakers in the song are finally standing where light is cast/is made to appear.) (past participle/adjective)

- **the white gleam of our bright star**

“Where is the light that is cast coming from? What word(s) help you figure this out?” (The light is coming from the bright star. The words white gleam and bright star help me figure this out because both of these words describe light.) (noun phrase)

- Students can close their eyes and imagine people standing where white gleam is cast from a bright star. Then, they can open their eyes and sketch what they visualized on their note-catcher. 

- Ask:

“Are the speakers in the song literally standing where the white gleam of a bright star is cast? How can we interpret this sentence figuratively instead?” (No, the author is using figurative language to help create a sense of hope for the future and a new beginning for the speakers in the song.)

- If time allows, students can discuss in pairs other examples of figurative language used to express hope after or among darkness. (Responses will vary, but may include: the light at the end of the tunnel, a rainbow in somebody’s cloud.) Encourage students to share expressions of figurative language in their home language. Consider displaying the Language Dive from Module 1, Unit 3, Lesson 6, which also used figurative language to create a sense of hope after hardship, to provide another example: **Now she can see blue sky beyond those dark clouds.**
