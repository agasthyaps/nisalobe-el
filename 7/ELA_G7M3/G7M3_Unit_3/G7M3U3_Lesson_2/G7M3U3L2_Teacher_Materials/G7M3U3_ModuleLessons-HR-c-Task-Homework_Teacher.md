Answers will vary, but may include: So far, “On Bully Patrol” is expanding on the themes in “Hope” by discussing how difficult times don’t last forever. In “Hope,” the speaker was addressing or writing to black people in general. In “On Bully Patrol,” the speaker is a mother speaking to her daughters in particular. She uses the example of a daughter being bullied at school to talk about the difficulties people face and how they don’t last forever. Grimes’ use of the poem “Hope” guides her throughout. The speaker is taking the wisdom of the poem “Hope” and passing it on to her daughters.
