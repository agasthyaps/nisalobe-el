<td><p><strong>Structure</strong></p>
<p><strong>How does structure (including rhyme and repetition) contribute to meaning?</strong></p>
<p><strong>It uses the Golden Shovel technique to take the words from the poem “Hope” by Georgia Douglas Johnson and use them as the ending words for each line in this poem.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It is organized into twelve stanzas. By ending the lines with words from “Hope,” the poet connects the meaning of the poem to the ideas in “Hope.” For example:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stanza 1: (In the first stanza, the speaker is comforting her youngest daughter. Her daughter was bullied and felt “feeble and frail” and also full of “sorrow,” like the children in “Hope.”)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stanza 2: (The speaker is recalling her own time being bullied in this stanza. It connects to the line from “Hope” because her daughter is being bullied for being “too dark . . . too whatever,” but the speaker also remembers that the “light shines through.”)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stanza 3: (The speaker is recalling that she lost her father when she was young. It connects to “Hope,” because the line mentions the world changing and how “all things pass away.”)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stanza 4: (This stanza is a description of the speaker’s daughter, how she is healthy now but was very sick once. It connects to the line from “Hope,” because she is remembering that the dark “night” of her daughter’s illness didn’t last forever.)</strong></p></td>
<td><p><strong>Language</strong></p>
<p><strong>How does the language (including word choice and figurative language) in the poem influence meaning?</strong></p>
<p><strong>“I shape my love like fingers, pluck the splinters of hate, one by / one” (6–7) – This shows how the mother comforts the daughter and shows how badly the daughter has been hurt.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“scars they hide, each jagged as a red-rose / thorn” (14–16) – This shows that the people who bully are often hurt themselves.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Thought I’d crack from the weight of the hurt, but time has / a way of teaching that life finds its / own balance.” (20–22) – It shows the pain she suffered when her father died, but also how time helped to heal her.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Be grateful that darkness burns to ash in the flame of the day” (33–34) – This shows that difficult times pass.</strong></p></td>
