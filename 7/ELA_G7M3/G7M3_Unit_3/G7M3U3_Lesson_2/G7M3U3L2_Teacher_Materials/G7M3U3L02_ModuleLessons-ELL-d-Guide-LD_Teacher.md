5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

RL.7.4, L.7.4b

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

But habits mean and horrible are **devilishly swift to sprout and spread**. (from stanza 5 of “On Bully Patrol” by Nikki Grimes)

**Lesson 2 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after students read and analyze figurative language in “On Bully Patrol” in Work Time B.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target (**I can determine the meaning of figurative language in “On Bully Patrol”**) and RL.7.4 by using figurative imagery to compare mean habits to weeds that grow out of control and by including repetition of sounds and structures to emphasize ideas in the stanza. This sentence also helps students address L.7.4b by featuring a word (**devilishly**) whose multiple affixes give clues about its meaning.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses figurative language, it incorporates alliteration (**swift to sprout and spread**), and it contains repetition of structure (**mean and horrible**; **sprout and spread**).

- Transfer: Interpreting and deconstructing figurative language in the second half of “On Bully Patrol” in the following lesson.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **But habits mean and horrible are <u>devilishly swift to sprout and spread</u>.**

- Ask:

“What is the gist of this sentence?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **devilishly swift to sprout and spread**. Draw students’ attention to the words **sprout and spread**.

- Ask:

“What action does the verb sprout usually describe?” (Sprout usually describes a plant that has just begun to grow.)

“Of the plants that sprout, which might also spread?” (Most plants sprout, but weeds spread.)

“What do you notice about the sounds of these two words, sprout and spread?” (Both words begin with an spr- sound.)

- As needed, remind students that repeated sounds are called alliteration.

“What is the impact of using alliteration in this poem?” (Responses will vary, but may include: It makes the poem sound better; it ties together different ideas in the poem.)

- Draw student attention to the word **devilishly**.

“What root and affixes do you see within this word? What do these parts of the word suggest about its meaning?” (The root devil describes an evil force. The affix -ish allows us to make adjectives out of nouns, and the affix -ly allows us to make adverbs out of adjectives. Altogether, this suggests that the meaning of the word is to do something in an evil way.)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **But habits mean and horrible are <u>devilishly swift to sprout and spread</u>.**

- Ask:

“What habits mean and horrible might the poet be referring to? You can refer to the poem as needed.” (The poet is referring to habits like lying, cheating, or treating others poorly.)

“How are mean and horrible habits similar to weeds that devilishly sprout and spread?” (Weeds grow quickly and without care for their environment. They can destroy a garden of flowers. This imagery helps the reader understand the power of mean and horrible habits.)

“How does the author’s use of the word devilishly contribute to the imagery of the sentence?” (The meaning of this word adds to the idea that negativity is spread by bad habits.)

“What kind of figurative imagery do you think the poet might have included if she were describing positive habits, like habits of character?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to generate images that are lighter, sweeter, and positively connotated.)

- Ask:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target:  
I can determine the meaning of figurative language in ‘On Bully Patrol’?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

> **Habits of character kind and true are \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ swift to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

adverb verb verb

> (subject + verb + adjective phrase + infinitive phrase)

- Ask:

“Use the frame to write, not about habits mean and horrible, but about habits of character! Follow the same pattern as the Mini Language Dive sentence to figuratively describe the movement or impact of habits of character. If you can, attempt alliteration!”

- Possible student answers:

**Habits of character kind and true are <u>sweetly</u> swift to <u>brighten</u> and <u>beautify</u>!**
