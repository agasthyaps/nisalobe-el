**Putting it All Together**

Below, write a paragraph explaining how the poet uses structure and language to develop a theme. Be sure to introduce the poem, state the theme, and support your interpretation with specific references to the structure and the language in the text.

“David’s Old Soul” by Nikki Grimes develops the theme that we can find deep strength within ourselves to help others. The writer structures the poem using a line from  
“The Negro Speaks of Rivers” by Langston Hughes. In that poem, Hughes connects the speaker’s history to the history of all black people. Hughes shows how it is possible to draw strength from the past. For David, the speaker of “David’s Old Soul,” strength is found deep within himself. He is told that he has an “old soul” (2). He learns what that means by looking inside of himself and learning to be strong. The author uses figurative language such as comparing David to a “tree my baby brothers can lean on” (7) to show how he uses this strength in himself to help others. Like the speaker in “The Negro Speaks of Rivers,” David’s soul has “grown deep like the rivers,” so he can help others.
