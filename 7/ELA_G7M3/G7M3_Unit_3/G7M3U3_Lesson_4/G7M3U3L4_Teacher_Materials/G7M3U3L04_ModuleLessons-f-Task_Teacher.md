29. How does “David’s Old Soul” expand upon the themes in “The Negro Speaks of Rivers”? How do the lines that Grimes chose for the Golden Shovel help demonstrate this connection?

Answers will vary, but may include: The poem “David’s Old Soul” takes the idea of finding strength in the past and applies it to a personal situation. The speaker in “The Negro Speaks of Rivers” was showing the rich history and strength of black people. In “David’s Old Soul,” the speaker finds strength “deep” within himself to help others. From Hughes’ poem, Grimes uses the line “my soul has grown deep like the rivers.” This line shows how people can be connected to something deep within them and to the past. It seems that David has found strength within himself. That strength might also come from the people before him.
