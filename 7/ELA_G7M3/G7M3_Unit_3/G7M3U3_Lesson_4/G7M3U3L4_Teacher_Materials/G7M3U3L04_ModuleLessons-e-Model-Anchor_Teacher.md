<td><strong>The writer structures the poem using a line from “The Negro Speaks of Rivers” by Langston Hughes. In that poem, Hughes connects his history to the history of all black people, and shows how it is possible to draw strength from the past. For David, the speaker of “David’s Old Soul,” strength is also found deep within himself. He is told that he has an “old soul” (2). He learns what that means by looking inside of himself and learning to be strong. The author uses figurative language such as comparing David to a “tree my baby brothers can lean on” (7) to show how he uses this strength in himself to help others.</strong></td>
