Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.7.2 – Work Time B: As a class, students draft an introduction to the Harlem Renaissance Museum that examines and conveys ideas about the Harlem Renaissance.

- RI.7.10 – Closing and Assessment A: Students share their reading and comprehension of literary nonfiction in the Grades 6–8 text complexity band proficiently.

- For the End of Unit 3 Assessment, students present their museum exhibit, focusing on presenting in a coherent manner, emphasizing salient points, and using adequate volume and clear pronunciation. (SL.7.4) Students use visual displays in their presentation to clarify and emphasize points. (SL.7.5). Students also adapt their speech for the presentation, using formal English when appropriate. (SL.7.6)

- Two lessons have been allocated for this assessment to ensure sufficient time for students to make their presentations. If these are taught in two separate lessons rather than together as one block, revisit the learning targets and the task at the beginning of the second 45-minute lesson to remind students of the task and purpose.

- In this lesson, students focus on contributing to a better world by presenting their knowledge for the benefit of the class.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release more responsibility more quickly to students as they comprehend the tasks or concepts. For example:

- Allow those students who are confident public speakers to coach students who are less confident with tips and strategies. If necessary, allow time before the presentations for these students to coach others. Also, ask these expert students to present first to model strong presentation skills.

- Teach presentation strategies, or allow students with knowledge in this arena to teach presentation strategies such as mindfulness, breathing techniques, and group initiatives to build collaboration and crew within presentation groups before the assessment.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students have focused on revising their curator’s statement and label for content and on improving their presentation skills. In this lesson, students use their presentation skills to show their understanding of the module’s content.

Support All Students

- The subject matter of the exhibit presentations may include descriptions of racism and injustice. Continue to monitor students to determine if issues surfacing from the content of the presentations need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually.

- Students may need additional support having the courage to present in front of their peers. Provide strategies such as calming breathing techniques, positive visualization techniques, and discussion of crew support. Consider alternatives such as presenting in small groups or one-on-one while other students are engaged in other activities. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson consists of tasks students have practiced throughout the second half of the unit. This gradual release supports students in independent achievement on this assessment.

- ELLs may find it challenging to give a presentation for an assessment. Assure students that skills like volume, pacing, clarity, and emphasis are not contingent on language acquisition abilities. In other words, students can succeed at these skills even if they are newcomers or beginners.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, 7.I.B.6, 7.I.C.10, and 7.I.C.12.

Assessment Guidance

- Assessment materials (Presentation Rubric) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources. When assessing and providing feedback to students on this assessment, use the students’ recorded presentations and the Presentation Rubric in this assessment or if preferred, use the Presentation checklist from Module 3, Lessons 8–9, Work Time A.

- For large classes, launch the Shared Writing activity from Work Time B early so that students can work quietly in small groups while other students make their presentations for assessment.

Down the Road

- In the next lessons, students will complete their museum exhibit and invite the community to attend their Harlem Renaissance Museum.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Return students’ **Module 3 Mid-Unit Assessments with feedback**, and allow students time to review feedback and write their name on the board if they require support.

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lessons 11–12**. Students may or may not choose to share their goals for this assessment with a partner or the class.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. End-of-Unit 3 Assessment: Present Museum Exhibit (45 minutes)

- Review appropriate learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can present my curator’s statement in a formal, focused, and clear way, emphasizing important points.”

“I can use appropriate eye contact, adequate volume, and clear pronunciation to present.”

“I can use visual displays in my presentation and exhibit to clarify and emphasize points.”

- Inform students that over the course of this lesson, they will complete an end of unit assessment by presenting their curator’s statement and label. Remind students of their work throughout Lessons 7–10, improving their writing and presentation skills.

- Ask students to retrieve their copies of the **Presentation checklist**. Distribute the **End of Unit 3 Assessment: Present Museum Exhibit.**

- Read aloud the assessment while students follow along. Answer clarifying questions.

- Before students begin to present, incorporate reflection on and awareness of the following academic mindsets: “This work has value for me,” “I can succeed at this,” and “My ability and competence grow with my effort.”

“What value does the task of a presentation have for you beyond this class? Why?” (Responses will vary and may include: This task has a lot of value for me because I will continue to make presentations in most of my high school and college classes, and in my work life as well.)

“What will help you succeed on this assessment?” (Responses will vary and may include: Improving my performance based on the feedback and revisions gained from the Tuning protocols will help me do well on this assessment. Taking a deep breath and calming myself down before I begin speaking will also help.)

“How has your ability and competence grown with your effort?” (Responses will vary and may include: As I revised and responded to feedback, my curator’s statement, label, and presentation improved. I worked really hard to make it better, and it shows.)

- Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart** and the **Work to Contribute to a Better World anchor chart.** Review perseverance and improving communities. Remind students that because they will be challenging themselves with a presentation, they will need to persevere. Review “I apply my learning to help our school, the community, and the environment.” Remind students that because they will eventually present their museum exhibit to the community, they will share it with a wider audience than this classroom, which will contribute to a better world.

- Invite students to retrieve their **curator’s statement, label**, and **exhibit visual** to begin the assessment. Record each presentation. Use the recording to assess presentation skills on the **End of Unit 3 Assessment: Presentation Rubric (for teacher reference).** For large classes, launch the Shared Writing activity from Work Time B so that students can work quietly in small groups while other students make their presentations for assessment.

- Remind students who are not presenting to remain silent so that the presenters can focus and do their very best work.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- Before the end of unit assessment in Work Time A, allow students several minutes to practice their presentations with a partner to ensure that they are ready to present them to a larger group.

For Heavier Support

- Before the end of unit assessment in Work Time A, allow students several minutes to practice their presentations with a partner to ensure that they are ready to present them to a larger group.

Work Time

B. Shared Writing: Introduction to the Harlem Renaissance Museum – W.7.2 (25 minutes)

- Inform students that in addition to the writing and presentations they will give to visiting community members, they will create an introduction as a class to the museum as a whole, so that when visitors walk into the classroom they will be introduced to the Harlem Renaissance.

- Ask students to retrieve their copies of ***One Last Word*** and open to the introduction on page 2. Read aloud the introduction, or have students read it silently to themselves. Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What makes this introduction strong?” (It gives a clear overview of the Harlem Renaissance, without going into too much detail about any one aspect. It teaches you why we should care about the Harlem Renaissance.)

- Invite students to choose an aspect of the introduction they’d like to write or create a visual display for. Be sure to “balance the boat” and have roughly the same number of students per group:

- The introduction paragraph

- A paragraph or visual display explaining and defining the Harlem Renaissance

- A paragraph or visual display explaining the themes of the Harlem Renaissance

- A paragraph or visual display about the historical context of the Harlem Renaissance

- A paragraph or visual display about the legacy of the Harlem Renaissance

- A conclusion paragraph

- In small groups, invite students to discuss how Grimes creates a strong paragraph(s) for their particular part. Distribute **Discussion Cards**. Circulate amongst the groups, prompting with the questions on the Discussion Card, as needed.

- The introduction group will focus on the first paragraph of Grimes’ introduction, discussing:

“How does Grimes create interest in the Harlem Renaissance in the first paragraph?” (Grimes uses enthusiastic language like “one of the most remarkable periods of artistic growth and exploration” to explain to readers why it was important. She also names some of the artists involved in the Harlem Renaissance and gives context about what they were doing.)

- The Harlem Renaissance definition group will focus on the second and third paragraph of Grimes’ introduction, discussing:

“How does Grimes summarize the period, people, writing, artwork, and purpose of the Harlem Renaissance?” (She summarizes this in a sentence or two. There’s a sentence on the period, a few sentences on the people, a sentence on the publications, and a sentence on the types of art created. She also explains the purpose of these works, “reflecting racial pride” and “black life, as seen from a black perspective.”)

- The historical context group will reread this sentence: “It was there, removed from the daily constrictions of Jim Crow laws and the constant threat of violence from the Ku Klux Klan, that African Americans spread their cultural wings and began to fly.” Next, they will discuss:

“How does this sentence explain the historical context of the Harlem Renaissance?” (Grimes discusses the struggle with the “constrictions” of Jim Crow laws and the violence of the Ku Klux Klan. This means that black Americans had to migrate to Harlem to escape these injustices and “spread their cultural wings.”)

- The legacy group will reread the fourth, fifth, and sixth paragraphs beginning “Through the decades . . . ” and ending with, “They still have much to teach us . . . ” Next, they will discuss:

“How does Grimes describe the impact of the Harlem Renaissance on her and others?” (She says that it reminds her “how vital it is that we define ourselves, set our own paths . . . and determine our own destiny.” For her and others, the Harlem Renaissance is about “celebrating who you are and achieving your dreams.”)

“Why should we still study the Harlem Renaissance today?” (Lessons from the Harlem Renaissance still resonate today. There are important ideas about toughness, survival, and having a positive attitude that were just as important back then as they are today.)

- The conclusion group will reread the seventh paragraph beginning, “These literary lights . . . ” Next, they will discuss:

“How does Grimes wrap up the entire introduction and leave you with inspiration from the Harlem Renaissance?” (She summarizes the context and legacy of the Harlem Renaissance, as well as the lasting themes and purpose of their writing and art. She recognizes their strength in the face of adversity.)

- Invite students to consider other ways of sharing their knowledge about each aspect of the introduction, besides writing a paragraph. As necessary, model sharing a few examples:

- “For the explanation and definition of the Harlem Renaissance, consider a web or visual display of words, phrases, pictures and sentences with the title, ‘The Harlem Renaissance was \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.’”

- “For the legacy of the Harlem Renaissance, consider a web or visual display of words, phrases, pictures and sentences with the title, “The Harlem Renaissance continues to be meaningful, because \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.’”

- Ask:

“What ideas do you have for making a visual display as opposed to a written paragraph?” (We could print photos and pictures or create our own artwork to show our thinking.)

“Where can you look for inspiration for a visual display?” (Nikki Grimes’ book has some great artwork inspiration.)

“Would you prefer to write a paragraph or make a visual display? Decide as a group and create your poster.”

- Distribute art supplies and poster board for students to create their introduction posters.

For Lighter Support

- For the shared writing activity in Work Time B, ensure that students are strategically grouped to best support and challenge them. This may mean mixed groupings by language or content proficiency. However, ensure that there are at least two students from each level and that there is no more than one level of difference among the students in a group. Strategic grouping affords students the opportunity of supporting and being challenged by others.

However, ensure that there are at least two students from each level and that there is no more than one level of difference among the students in a group. Strategic grouping affords students the opportunity of supporting and being challenged by others.

- In Work Time B, some students may need additional support. Draw these students together and help them to read their excerpt of the introduction, pausing after each sentence for them to highlight, illustrate, and paraphrase. Ask students to work together to identify any sentences that they can adapt and use in their own writing. Finally, encourage those who prefer to create a visual or use their home language for their portion of the introduction.

Closing and Assessment

A. Independent Research Reading Share – RI.7.10 (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to guide students to share their independent research reading, reminding students that the purpose of research reading is to build their content knowledge, domain-specific vocabulary, and achievement on reading complex texts.

- Refer to the **Independent Reading Sample Plans** to guide students through a research reading share, or use another routine.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- During Closing and Assessment A, students share with a partner the independent research reading book they have been reading. Sharing about their book will ensure that students are engaged with the book and give them an opportunity to find a different one if they are no longer interested in their choice. As necessary, review the purpose of independent research reading. Emphasize the benefits of reading multiple texts on the same topic (e.g., repeated exposure to relevant vocabulary).
