<td><strong>The poet uses the ideas and themes in “Hope” to expand her own ideas and themes. Each line from “Hope” is related to the ideas in one of Grimes’ stanzas. Through these stanzas, the poet shows how she had difficulties like her daughters have had. But she was able to work hard and discover her passions. The poet uses figurative language throughout to develop this theme as well. She reminds her daughters that “darkness burns to ash in the flame of the day” (33–34). This line shows how difficulties pass. But the speaker also reminds her daughters that “traits of beauty tend to inch along in growth” (45). This line shows hope and the importance of persevering through adversity.</strong></td>
