Launch

Remind students that they have been focusing on how poets use figurative language to create meaning. Consider displaying the previous Language Dive sentences from Module 3,  
Unit 1, Lessons 5–6 (**Out from the gloomy past, Till now we stand at last, Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast**) and from Module 3, Unit 1, Lesson 10 (**My soul has grown deep like the rivers**). Invite students to recall how the authors used figurative language to develop the themes of each of these poems, and invite them to take a minute to discuss this with a partner. Share that this Language Dive also uses figurative language to develop the theme of the poem.

My father says

Deconstruct

- **My father**

“Who is this chunk about?” (the speaker’s father)

- **says**

“What does this chunk tell us?” (that the speaker’s father often uses an expression; the subsequent chunks will tell us the expression the speaker’s father uses)

hard work is the clay

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- **hard work**

“What is this chunk about?” (Hard work; the speaker is telling us her father compares hard work to clay.)

- **is the clay**

“Can you figure out why the speaker’s father says hard work is the clay? Is this literal or figurative language?” (The speaker’s father is using figurative language to compare hard work to clay—just like clay makes sculptures, he is saying hard work makes something else. We will learn what he says hard work makes in the next chunk.)

- **Students can use Conversation Cues as they discuss. To provide heavier support, display a suggested sequence, such as the one below:**

- Goal 1: Can you say more about that?

- Goal 1: So, do you mean \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?

- Goal 3: Do you agree or disagree with what your classmate said? Why? I’ll give you time to think.

- Goal 4: Who can add on to what your classmate said?

- Students can discuss in pairs something they have done or are doing that takes hard work. They can close their eyes and imagine their hard work being clay. Just like clay is used to make a sculpture, invite them to imagine what their hard work has built or is building towards. Alternatively, provide actual clay for students to feel the “hard work” as they mold it. They can sketch what they visualized or molded from their clay on their note-catcher. 

- Students may recall their work with metaphors in Grade 6 (L.6.5a), as well as in Module 3, Unit 1, Lesson 3 Remind students that a metaphor is a type of figurative language where the subject is said to be something else (noun phrase + to be + noun phrase). Explain that metaphors are often used in poetry to compare two unlike things in order to spark the readers’ imagination and make their writing more interesting and lyrical. For extra support, contrast metaphors with similes, which use the word ‘like’ or ‘as’ to directly compare two unlike things, as in the Module 3, Unit 2, Lesson 6–7 Language Dive sentence: **My soul has grown deep like the rivers**.

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Students can work in pairs to list other metaphors they know, comparing two unlike things by saying one thing is another, (e.g., I am a night owl; You are a shining star; The world is a stage) and to discuss the literal meanings behind the metaphors. Encourage students to share metaphors in their home language. Students can complete the sentence frame, writing their metaphor on their note-catchers. 

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is/are/am a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

noun phrase noun phrase

(e.g., **<u>You</u>** are **<u>a shining star</u>**.)

- To provide lighter support: “Can you use coordinate adjectives (two or more adjectives that describe the same noun) in your metaphor? (L.7.2a) (e.g., You are a **<u>bright, shining star</u>**.)

- To provide heavier support: Invite students to work with a partner to write a metaphor together.

dreams are molded from.

Deconstruct

- Ask:

“What does this chunk tell us?” (Dreams are molded from something. This chunk continues the metaphor from the first chunk, telling us that dreams are molded from hard work, just as sculptures are molded from clay.)

- **molded**

“Can you figure out why the speaker’s father uses the word molded instead of made?” (Mold means to form or shape something into a particular form. Grimes uses molded instead of made to extend the metaphor of hard work being clay, molding dreams just as clay is molded into sculptures.)

- Students can discuss in pairs a dream that they have. They can close their eyes and imagine molding their dream out of clay, similar to what they visualized or experienced in the previous chunk. Invite them to think about the habits of character it takes to mold their dream (e.g., hard work, perseverance, initiative, responsibility, determination). They can open their eyes and sketch what they visualized on their note-catcher, listing the habits of character it takes to mold their dream below their drawing. 

My father says hard work is the clay dreams are molded from.

Reconstruct

- **My father says <u>hard work is the clay</u> dreams are molded from.**

“How can we say these lines in a more literal way?” (Answers will vary, but may include: My father says it takes hard work to achieve dreams.)

- Remind students that in earlier lessons they looked at how figurative language is used to develop the theme of a poem. Invite students to share out what the theme of this poem is. The theme of this poem is: It takes hard work to achieve dreams. This line captures the poem’s theme and stands as the central metaphor of the poem.

“Can you figure out why Grimes uses figurative language to develop the theme in this poem, rather than doing so in a more literal way? How does this line connect to the title of the poem, ‘The Sculptor?’” (Answers will vary, but may include: Grimes uses figurative language to capture the reader’s attention and emphasize the fact that dreams do not just come; they must be molded through hard work. This line connects to the title of the poem, “The Sculptor,” by comparing the hard work that goes into making dreams to the hard work of a sculptor molding clay into a sculpture.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Answers will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the Module Understanding, There are common themes, practices, and structures across the art, music, and literature of the Harlem Renaissance?” (Answers will vary.)

Practice (Sentence)

- Students can complete the following sentence frame to practice using figurative language to express that it takes hard work to achieve dreams. 

> **Hard work is the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ dreams \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

noun phrase verb phrase

> (e.g., Hard work is the <u>garden</u> dreams <u>are nourished in</u>.)

- Ask:

“How can we use figurative language in our own writing to develop theme and contribute to meaning?”

- To provide lighter support: Invite students to exchange the noun “dreams” for other noun phrases to create other sentences that develop a similar theme.

- To provide heavier support: Invite students to discuss the meaning of the original lines in home language groups.
