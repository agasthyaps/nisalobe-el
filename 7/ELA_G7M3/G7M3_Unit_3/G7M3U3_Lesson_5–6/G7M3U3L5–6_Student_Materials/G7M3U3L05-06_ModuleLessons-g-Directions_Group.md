Interactive Flowchart Directions

RL.7.2, RL.7.4, RL.7.5, L.7.5

1.  Choose an Interactive Flowchart card. Read the card aloud (e.g., “The Sculptor”).

2.  Using an arrow card, connect this card to another Interactive Flowchart card by form, language and/or theme (e.g., “Calling Dreams”).

3.  Read the second card aloud.

4.  Explain why the two Interactive Flowchart cards belong together, how one shows collaboration with the other by form, language, and/or theme. (e.g., “The Sculptor” is connected to “Calling Dreams” by the theme of working hard to make dreams come true. In “The Sculptor,” the speaker explains that dreams are “carved, muscled into something solid, something true.” In “Calling Dreams,” the speaker tells of achieving dreams after a long struggle: “now, at length, I rise, I wake!” Both poems are about making dreams come true.)

5.  Another member of the group takes a turn by either:

- Adding a new arrow and another card anywhere on the “flowchart.”

- Verbally explaining a new connection between any of the cards already connected on the table.

- Writing an element of structure (form, repetition, rhyme), element of language (figurative, connotative), or theme from the poetry or artwork on an index card and then using an arrow to add it to the flowchart.

6.  Take turns using the remaining Interactive Flowchart cards and continuing to explain the connections between them.

7.  The activity ends when time is up or when all cards have been used and group members have explained all the connections they see.
