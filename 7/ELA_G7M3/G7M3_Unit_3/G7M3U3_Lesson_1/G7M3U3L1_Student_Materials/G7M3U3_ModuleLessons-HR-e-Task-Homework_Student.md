Homework: QuickWrite about Legacy

**Name:** **Date:**

1.  Read the following prompt, and answer the question below.

Today you learned about the legacy of the Harlem Renaissance with the Building Background Knowledge protocol. You explored a video clip of Alvin Ailey’s *Uptown* and read an excerpt from Robert J. Price, Jr.’s essay “Hegemony, Hope, and the Harlem Renaissance: Taking Hip Hop Culture Seriously.” In small groups, you explored the preface from *One Last Word*, Matthew Rushing’s podcast about *Uptown*, Nikki Grimes’ “Emergency Measures,” and James Ransome’s artwork from *One Last Word*.

Now that you have this background knowledge, what is the legacy of the Harlem Renaissance? How do current artists, as Nikki Grimes asks, “find fuel for the future from the past”? (RL.7.1, RI.7.1)
