**Hegemony, Hope, and the Harlem Renaissance: Taking Hip Hop Culture Seriously**

**by Robert J. Price, Jr.**

Historical reflection on the Harlem Renaissance will generate insights for interpreting hip hop as an urban youth culture. The Harlem Renaissance and hip hop culture can be compared and contrasted using the following headings: spirituality, youth and representation, and the streets.

Spirituality. The spiritual energies of the Harlem Renaissance must be recognized as the inspirational force driving the cultural production. DuBois (1903) describes double consciousness as a “spiritual striving” in his classic *The Souls of Black Folks*. The notion of “souls” was important because of the racist idea that black people were not fully human because they did not have souls. DuBois also wrote the *Gift of Black Folks* (1924) to define black people as spiritually endowed with gifts including intellectual resources. Alain Locke concludes the foreword to *The New Negro* (1925) explaining the role of spirit and culture:

Negro life is not only establishing new contacts and founding new centers, it is finding a new soul. There is a fresh spiritual and cultural focusing. We have, as the heralding sign, an unusual outburst of creative expression. There is a renewed race-spirit that consciously and proudly sets itself apart. Justifiably then, we speak of the offerings of this book embodying these ripening forces as culled from the first fruits of the Negro Renaissance.

Hip hop culture shares the same spiritual sources derived from black church tradition. The strong tradition of creative black preaching and quality music are sources for rap music. The rapper integrates the two elements of the black church in rap music: preaching and music. The rapper preaches by creatively rhyming over music with deep bass tones. There is a spirituality at work in hip hop culture through rapper as preacher.

Youth and representation. Like hip hop culture, the Harlem Renaissance was a youth culture movement. Inscribed on the dedication page of the book is: This volume is dedicated to the younger generation. The majority of the contributors to *The New Negro* were young “rappers” in their twenties like Langston Hughes, Countee Cullen, and Zora Neale Hurston. As editor, Locke wrote “Negro Youth Speaks” to underscore the prophetic vision for the new Negro in light of the “double-consciousness” of W.E.B. DuBois. The new Negro would no longer see herself through the eyes of dominant culture, but would self-define Negro culture and identity inspiring hope in the process. Locke (p. 5) writes:

This is what, even more than any “most creditable record of fifty years of freedom,” requires that the Negro of today be seen through other than the dusty spectacles of past controversy. The day of “aunties,” “uncles” and “mammies” is equally gone. Uncle Tom and Sambo have passed on…The popular melodrama has about played itself out, and it is time to scrap the fictions, garret the bogeys and settle down to a realistic facing of facts.

The hip hop motto of “keeping it real” was first conceived by Locke in the struggle to critique the media representation of blackness. The new negro wanted to jettison the media portrayal of blacks in *Birth of a Nation* (1915) by using the depictions as an opportunity for learning and development. This is the message of bell hooks (1992). The Buckwheat character had racist intent; but “black looks” are the critical ways that learners interpret—not imbibe—black representations. Therefore, I agree with Guy (2004) that it is essential to promote critical media literacy among educators as an important first step in addressing the complex and adverse influences of gangsta rap and hip hop on learners in classrooms.

The streets. There is also a gap between education and “the streets.” The streets are the skool of hard knocks that is the urban context for the real life world of hip hop. Guy (2004) describes it this way: Black learners who have internalized the negative messages often lack interest in pursuing education at all, and white and black educators often hold negative and stereotypical views of black learners that interfere with their ability to meet learners’ needs. Tupac Shakur defined “thug” as a hopeless or marginalized person. The “thug life” is about hard knocks because formal education is not viewed as the solution to the real life problems of violence in the hood, crack cocaine, no father’s name on the birth certificate, being a baby mama, jobless, etc. Langston Hughes was educated on the streets of Harlem listening to the hopeless and marginalized sing the blues. Many of his poems were written to the rhythm of blues music. Hughes listened and learned from the streets. He was highly criticized by middle-class blacks for writing blues poems and his “ethnographic research” among the urban outcasts. Indeed, many judge hip hop because it is married to the streets.
