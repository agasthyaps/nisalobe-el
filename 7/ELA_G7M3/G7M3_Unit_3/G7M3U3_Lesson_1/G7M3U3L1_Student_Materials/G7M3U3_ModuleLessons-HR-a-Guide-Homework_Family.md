What are some of the lasting legacies of the Harlem Renaissance?

- *The Harlem Renaissance has contributed to contemporary art, music, literature, and politics.*

What will your student be doing at school?

Students begin the unit exploring the legacy of the Harlem Renaissance, noting how many artists today are influenced by the writing and themes of the Harlem Renaissance.

To gain this background knowledge, students examine short informational and literary texts, visual art, and performances to further develop their sense of how the Harlem Renaissance continues to impact us today. They explore the legacy of the Harlem Renaissance through Nikki Grimes’ poem “Emergency Measures,” original artwork associated with the poem, and the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater’s ballet, *Uptown*, which was inspired by the people, places, art, music, and writing of the Harlem Renaissance.

Students then study Nikki Grimes’ contemporary poetry alongside the poetry of the Harlem Renaissance. In her poems, Grimes uses the Golden Shovel method, taking one line of text from a Harlem Renaissance poem and using it in her own poetry. Grimes pairs her poem “On Bully Patrol” with Georgia Douglas Johnson’s “Hope” and pairs her poem “David’s Old Soul” with Langston Hughes’ “A Negro Speaks of Rivers.” Students study these poetry pairings for connections between structure or how Grimes uses the words of the Harlem Renaissance poems. They also study Grimes’ poems for her use of figurative language, such as metaphors and similes. Finally, students study how Grimes develops themes from the Harlem Renaissance, such as persevering through hardships to realize dreams.

Students also explore the Golden Shovel method of poetry writing by creating one or more poems borrowing lines from other Harlem Renaissance poems. For the mid-unit assessment, students read and analyze Nikki Grimes’ “The Sculptor” and its paired poem, Georgia Douglas Johnson’s “Calling Dreams.” Students examine the poems for the effects of the Golden Shovel poetry structure, the figurative language, and themes such as working hard to realize dreams. Throughout the first half of the unit, students learn the relevance of the themes of the Harlem Renaissance in contemporary poetry.

In the second half of the unit, students continue their exploration of the legacy of the Harlem Renaissance by creating artifacts for the performance task, a Harlem Renaissance museum exhibit. Each student’s exhibit includes

- three pieces from the Harlem Renaissance and one contemporary piece that they have studied or created themselves, such as their Golden Shovel poems developed in the beginning of the unit;

- a curator’s statement explaining how the works are connected by theme; and

- labels using examples from the piece to explain the structure, language, and theme.

For the end of unit assessment, students’ presentation skills are assessed as they present a visual piece from the exhibit, the label for the piece, and the curator’s statement. Students revise and practice their presentation, curator’s statements, and labels in two lessons. The unit concludes with the Harlem Renaissance museum, in which students contribute to making a better world by sharing these important works with their community.

Central to the EL Education curriculum is a focus on “habits of character” and social-emotional learning. Students work to become effective learners, developing mindsets and skills for success in college, career, and life (e.g., initiative, responsibility, perseverance, collaboration); work to become ethical people, treating others well and standing up for what is right (e.g., empathy, integrity, respect, compassion); and work to contribute to a better world, putting their learning to use to improve communities (e.g., citizenship, service).

In this unit, students work to become effective learners by persevering through rigorous texts, collaborating with groupmates, and taking initiative by assuming leadership roles in the group. For the mid-unit assessment, students practice integrity and perseverance as they work independently. Also, they take responsibility for their own learning as they track progress on reading standards. Additionally, students contribute to a better world by creating an engaging Harlem Renaissance museum exhibit, using their strengths to help others grow and presenting their knowledge of the Harlem Renaissance to a wider audience.

The texts in this unit also focus on the habits of character. “On Bully Patrol” demonstrates perseverance as the speaker recounts the difficulty she experienced and how she overcame it. The speaker in “David’s Old Soul” demonstrates perseverance and initiative as he finds the inner strength to support his younger siblings. The speaker in “The Sculptor” demonstrates perseverance, initiative, and the academic mindsets “My ability and competence grow with my effort” and “I can succeed at this” as she strives to make her dreams come true. All these examples provide context and models for students to focus on habits of character. Additionally, students have the opportunity to practice the habits of character of empathy and respect if they or their classmates struggle with the descriptions of racism, bullying, and family struggles in the poems.

How can you support your student at home?

Explore more poems and artwork from the anchor text *One Last Word* or by other artists influenced by the Harlem Renaissance. Read and discuss informational texts with your student about the legacy of the Harlem Renaissance. You may use questions such as the following for your conversations:

- Who was influenced by the Harlem Renaissance?

- How were they influenced?

- How is their work similar to and different from the Harlem Renaissance artist’s work?

Engage in conversations with your student about the habits of character focus of this module. Consider these prompts:

- Who demonstrates a habit of character in something you read in class or at home? What habit of character do they demonstrate? How do they demonstrate it?

- What habit of character did you demonstrate as you read, heard, or witnessed people’s struggles in the Harlem Renaissance content?

Unit 3: Homework

In Lesson 1, students write a QuickWrite to synthesize their learning about the legacy of the Harlem Renaissance.

In Lessons 2–3, students answer selected and constructed response questions to further analyze the poem read in class and to practice for the mid-unit assessment.

In Lessons 2–6, students respond to the poetry read in class by creating a poem, illustration, dance, song, or a personal reflection paragraph.

In Lessons 7–12, students have the option to create a poem, story, song, dance, artwork, or nonfiction piece in response to works from the Harlem Renaissance.

In Lessons 1 and 4–12, homework focuses on research reading for which students read a topic-related book of choice and answer a question related to the unit’s ideas and skills.

Research Reading: When not reading their anchor text, your student is expected to independently research the topic by reading topic-related books of his or her choice for approximately 20 minutes each day and responding to a prompt of choice in the front of the independent reading journal. These are usually books your student will bring home from school; however, they may be topic-related books chosen by the student at the public or your home library. Prompts for independent reading can be found in the homework materials provided below.

Independent Reading

**Directions:** Remember to record responses to research reading in the front of your independent reading journal and responses to choice reading in the back. Try to choose a different prompt each time.

Record any new vocabulary in your vocabulary log. Underline vocabulary found during independent reading.

**Record:**

- Date

- Title and author of your reading book

- Pages you have read

- Prompt

- Response

**Example:**

<u>Date:</u> 01/30/19

<u>Book Title and Author:</u> “Harlem Renaissance Packet” by EL Education

<u>Pages Read:</u> N/A

<u>Prompt:</u> How did the artists, musicians, and writers interact with each other? How did this collaboration affect their work?

<u>Response:</u> The authors of *Shuffle Along* collaborated to create the story, music, and lyrics of the show. They also collaborated with actors and musicians to perform the show. This collaboration produced a musical that was so popular it changed musical theater forever by combining a story with music and dance.

**Consider using the following independent reading prompts.**[^1]

- Who were the important people involved in this movement? What impact did they have on the movement?

- How did the artists, musicians, and writers interact with each other? How did this collaboration affect their work?

- What are some historical factors surrounding this time period? How did these historical factors influence the artists, musicians, and writers and their work?

- What is the legacy of the Harlem Renaissance? How has it impacted art, music, and literature today?

- Choose one new word from your reading today and analyze it on a vocabulary square.

| **Definition in your own words**                  | **Synonyms** (words with the same meaning**)** |
|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Words with the same affix or root**             | **Sketch**                                     |
| **Translation in home language** (if appropriate) |                                                |

Vocabulary

**Directions:** In the classroom, you have been recording words from your texts in your vocabulary log. Throughout this unit, you have been reading topic-related books at home to build your knowledge of epidemics and recording words in your independent reading journal.

Choose a word from your research reading or from a text you’ve read in class and add the word to your vocabulary log. Try to choose a different word to add and to practice a different vocabulary strategy each time. For each word, be sure to add the following:

1.  The definition, or meaning, of the word

<!-- -->

3.  The vocabulary strategy you used to figure out the meaning of the word

4.  A sketch or diagram that helps you to better understand the meaning of the word

Record new vocabulary in vocabulary logs and mark academic vocabulary with a symbol, for example, a star:

- Academic vocabulary: words you might find in informational texts on many different topics. For example, the words *evidence* and *rationale* are words that could be found in books on any topic.

- Domain-specific vocabulary: words about a particular topic. For example, the words *tadpoles*, *frogspawn*, and *amphibian* are some that would be found on the topic of frogs.

**Vocabulary Strategies**

As a reminder, the vocabulary strategies we’ve been working on in class are listed below:

- Context: Read the sentence around the word.

- Look at the affixes for clues.

- Look at the root of the word for clues.

- Use a dictionary.

- Discuss the word with another person (after attempting some of the above strategies).

[^1]: Some of the prompts will not be appropriate for the text students are reading. Invite students to choose a prompt that works for the text they have just read.
