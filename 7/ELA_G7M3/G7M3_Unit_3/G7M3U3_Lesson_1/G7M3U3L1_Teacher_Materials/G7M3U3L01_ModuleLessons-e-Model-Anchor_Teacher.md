Building Background Knowledge Response Chart

RL.7.1, RI.7.1

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Teacher Directions:** Draw boxes on chart paper as shown in the diagram below to create one response chart for each group. Then students will record key details from their group’s discussion of the mystery text (student 1), the common text (student 2), the expert texts (student 3), and all the texts (student 4). Possible student responses are below the diagram.

>
> \- The spoon is like the inspiration (or fuel) from the past for the future.
>
> \- This image represents Grimes and her poems: she is the child; the spoon is the Golden Shovel method; she is scooping lines from the Harlem Renaissance poets to use in her own work.
