Homework: QuickWrite about Legacy

(Example for Teacher Reference)

1.  Read the following prompt, and answer the question below.

Today you learned about the legacy of the Harlem Renaissance with the Building Background Knowledge protocol. You explored a video clip of Alvin Ailey’s *Uptown* and read an excerpt from Robert J. Price, Jr.’s essay “Hegemony, Hope, and the Harlem Renaissance: Taking Hip Hop Culture Seriously.” In small groups, you explored the preface from *One Last Word*, Matthew Rushing’s podcast about *Uptown*, Nikki Grimes’ “Emergency Measures,” and James Ransome’s artwork from *One Last Word*.

Now that you have this background knowledge, what is the legacy of the Harlem Renaissance? How do current artists, as Nikki Grimes asks, “find fuel for the future from the past”? (RL.7.1, RI.7.1)

Answers will vary, but may include: Nikki Grimes is a great example of a contemporary poet who has found “fuel for the future from the past.” In the preface to her book *One Last Word,* she explains this influence. “The poets of the Harlem Renaissance remained my primary influences. . . . I want to take a moment to celebrate those earlier poets, add my voice to theirs in a very direct way, and introduce them to a new generation.” These lines show that Grimes is inspired by the words of the Harlem Renaissance writers. She creates contemporary poems using their words in her poetry. She also has current artists create artwork to illustrate her poetry. Together they remind us of the wisdom of the Harlem Renaissance writers and artists.

Similarly, Matthew Rushing’s choreography in the ballet *Uptown* is influenced by the artists, musicians, dancers, and writers of the Harlem Renaissance. He researched the artists from the Harlem Renaissance to create something new, inspired by the people, places, and clothes of the time. He found “fuel for the future from the past” in an effort to educate his audience about this important time period through dance.
