<td><p><strong>Structure</strong></p>
<p><strong>How does structure (including rhyme and repetition) contribute to meaning?</strong></p>
<p><strong>It uses the Golden Shovel technique to take the words from the poem “Hope” by Georgia Douglas Johnson and use them as the ending words for each line in this poem.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It is organized into twelve stanzas. By ending the lines with words from “Hope,” the poet connects the meaning of the poem to the ideas in “Hope.” For example:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stanza 1: In the first stanza, the speaker is comforting her youngest daughter. Her daughter was bullied and felt “feeble and frail” and also full of “sorrow,” like the children in “Hope.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stanza 2: The speaker is recalling her own time being bullied in this stanza. It connects to the line from “Hope” because her daughter is being bullied for being “too dark . . . too whatever,” but the speaker also remembers that the “light shines through.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stanza 3: The speaker is recalling that she lost her father when she was young. It connects to “Hope,” because the line mentions the world changing and how “all things pass away.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stanza 4: This stanza is a description of the speaker’s daughter, how she is healthy now but was very sick once. It connects to the line from “Hope,” because she is remembering that the dark “night” of her daughter’s illness didn’t last forever.</strong></p></td>
<td><p><strong>Language</strong></p>
<p><strong>How does the language (including word choice and figurative language) in the poem influence meaning?</strong></p>
<p><strong>“I shape my love like fingers, pluck the splinters of hate, one by / one” (6–7)—this shows how the mother comforts the daughter and shows how badly the daughter has been hurt.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“scars they hide, each jagged as a red-rose / thorn” (14–16)—this shows that the people who bully are often hurt themselves.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Thought I’d crack from the weight of the hurt, but time has / a way of teaching that life finds its / own balance” (20–22)—it shows the pain she suffered when her father died, but also how time helped to heal her.</strong></p></td>

<td><p><strong>Structure (cont.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stanza 7: The speaker is describing her family’s life and reminding her daughters to enjoy their father. It is connected to the line from “Hope,” because it urges the children to take time to enjoy their lives, as in the “mellowing shade.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stanza 8: The speaker is trying to imagine the future for her daughters, trying to imagine what they will be and do. She also mentions the advice she gives them. This is connected to the line from “Hope,” because that line urges the children to “rise with the hour for which you were made,” or to become who you are meant to be.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stanza 9: The speaker is thinking about how her eldest daughter wants to date, but she wants her to be patient. It is connected to the line from “Hope,” because that line focuses on the “cycle of seasons,” or how time has different cycles.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stanza 10: The speaker is thinking of her own childhood and comparing it to her daughter’s. The line from “Hope” reminds the reader that life and events play out in the “orb of an infinite plan.”</strong></p></td>
<td><p><strong>Language (cont.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Be grateful that darkness burns to ash in the flame of the day” (33–34)—this shows that difficult times pass.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Count these times precious, girls” (59)—this is a reminder to her daughters to appreciate time with their father.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Your longings were / already carefully carved” (69–70)—this suggests that her daughters have a purpose that they need to discover to live their truest lives.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Hard to explain tidals to one who’s never gotten her feet wet” (76–77)—shows that her daughter has a different sense of time because she is still inexperienced.</strong></p></td>

**Putting It All Together**

Below, write a paragraph explaining how the poet uses structure and language to develop a theme. Be sure to introduce the poem, state the theme, and support your interpretation with specific references to the structure and the language in the text.

Answers will vary, but may include: “On Bully Patrol” by Nikki Grimes develops the theme that difficulties don’t last forever, but it takes hard work to achieve your goals. The poem is structured into twelve stanzas. In each stanza the speaker thinks about her daughters and advice she has given them, as well as recalls her own childhood. The poet uses the ideas and themes in “Hope” to expand her own ideas and themes. Each line from “Hope” is related to the ideas in one of Grimes’ stanzas. Through these stanzas, the poet shows how she had difficulties like her daughters have had. But she was able to work hard and discover her passions. The poet uses figurative language throughout to develop this theme as well. She reminds her daughters that “darkness burns to ash in the flame of the day” (33–34). This line shows how difficulties pass. But the speaker also reminds her daughters that “traits of beauty tend to inch along in growth” (45). This line shows that it takes hard work to achieve your goals. The words from “Hope” and Grimes’ own figurative language emphasize the theme that difficulties don’t last, and you can overcome difficulty with effort and time.
