27. How does “On Bully Patrol” expand upon the themes in “Hope”? How does Grimes use of the poem for the Golden Shovel help demonstrate this connection? (RL.7.2, RL.7.5)

Answers will vary, but may include: “On Bully Patrol” expands on the themes in “Hope” by discussing how difficult times don’t last forever. In “Hope,” the speaker was addressing black people in general, while in this poem, a mother is speaking to her daughters in particular. Grimes’ use of the poem “Hope” guides her throughout. The speaker is taking a general example and providing similar advice to her daughters. Like Johnson, she reminds her daughters and the readers of the beauty that is inside, and how it can take time to develop. “The oak tarries long in the depth of the seed,” (5) Johnson writes. The speaker of “On Bully Patrol” reminds her daughters that “traits of beauty tend to inch along in growth” (45). It can take a long time to achieve what you want, but it is worth the wait.
