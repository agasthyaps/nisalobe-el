**Curator’s Statement**

**Weathering the Storm**

In the 1920s the energy of the artistic world was focused on Harlem and the experience of black Americans overall. These artists were fighting for their right to be heard and to address themes that were important to them. Together, they shed light on many important issues and brought great beauty into the world.

In this exhibit, you will see one part of this story, through a group of works that connect nature and our lives. “Truth” by Nikki Grimes, “Storm Ending” by Jean Toomer, “Like a Strong Tree” by Claude McKay, and *Isle de Bonaventure* by Palmer Hayden invite us to explore the theme that nature’s mysteries can teach us about how complex life can be.

Experience these works with an eye to the past and the present, and perhaps they will remind you of the beauty and mystery all around us. They may even remind you of the beautiful surprises life can hold. Open your eyes, look around, and as Grimes says, “See where it heads”!

***Isle de Bonaventure* painting by Palmer Hayden**

Stop and experience the painting *Isle de Bonaventure*, by Palmer Hayden, and discover the rows of birds flocking over a turbulent ocean. The clouds hang overhead, and the painting is full of light and life that only a true artist can bring to the world. The painting reminds us of the complex swirl of life all around us, if we only look.
