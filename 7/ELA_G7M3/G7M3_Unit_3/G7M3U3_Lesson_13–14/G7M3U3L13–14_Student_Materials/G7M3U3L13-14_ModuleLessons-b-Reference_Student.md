Peer Critique: Museum Exhibit  
Norms and Directions

SL.7.1, SL.7.4, SL.7.6

**Norms**

- Be Kind: Always treat others with dignity and respect. This means we never use words that are hurtful, including sarcasm.

- Be Specific: Focus on particular strengths and weaknesses, rather than making general comments like “It’s good” or “I like it.” Provide insight into why it is good or what, specifically, you like about it.

- Be Helpful: The goal is to positively contribute to the individual or the group, not to simply be heard. Echoing the thoughts of others or cleverly pointing out details that are irrelevant wastes time.

**Directions**

1.  Move into pairs and decide who is Partner A (the exhibit curator and expert first) and who is partner B (the museumgoer first).

2.  Partner A invites partner B to the exhibit.

3.  Partner B either asks a question or remains silent.

4.  If partner B remains silent, partner A discusses the exhibit, and prompts partner B to ask a question.

5.  The conversation ensues.

6.  Partner B listens carefully while looking at the criteria for the work (Performance Task anchor chart, Presentation checklist, and Discussion Norms).

7.  Partner B provides kind, specific, and helpful feedback based on criteria and the flow of the conversation.

8.  Partner A responds to the feedback.

9.  Partners switch roles and repeat steps 2–8.

10. Partners individually reflect on feedback.
