Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- SL.7.4 – Opening A: On an entrance ticket, students QuickWrite about which descriptions, facts, details, and examples they are most excited to share about the Harlem Renaissance in the museum they are creating.

- SL.7.4– Work Time A: Students finish drafting their museum labels, choosing pertinent details, descriptions, and examples to explain how each work chosen demonstrates the theme of the exhibit.

- SL.7.5 – Work Time B: Students work together as a class to set up their museum for visitors, creating multimedia components and visual displays to clarify and emphasize points about the Harlem Renaissance.

- SL.7.4 – Closing and Assessment A: With their peers, students practice the conversations they will be having with museumgoers, focusing on using appropriate eye contact, adequate volume, and clear pronunciation as well as formal English.

- SL.7.4 – Closing and Assessment B: Students present their Harlem Renaissance exhibits to their guests.

- SL.7.6 – Closing and Assessment B: Students use formal English while presenting their museum exhibits.

- In this lesson, students focus on contributing to a better world by presenting their knowledge of the Harlem Renaissance in an exhibit that will be shared with a wider audience. Students also work on being effective learners because learning new techniques for writing and giving good presentations can be difficult. Students will need to practice perseverance and collaboration to succeed in these tasks.

- Creating an exhibition gives students the opportunity to practice perseverance and collaboration skills that they can apply to many other tasks in and out of school. Using technology and precision may be challenging for students, but they will grow and produce a product of which they can be proud.

- The Think-Pair-Share and Peer Critique protocols are used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- Museums are wonderful ways to involve students in their learning. There are ways to make them even more engaging, authentic, and effective. Consider the following:

- Create a museum space that feels different from the classroom environment. To do so, add some professional touches. Change the lighting, create a ticket booth, provide souvenirs, and create a café.

- Invite students to create professional museum signage. Provide materials so that they may add touches of professionalism to their work and take more pride in their work.

- Emphasize the structural and design elements of the museum. Create an experience for the students and the audience that captures the essence of a museum experience as closely as possible. For example, use curtains, tablecloths, music, and spotlights. These touches will make the experience memorable and powerful.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release more responsibility more quickly to students as they comprehend the tasks or concepts. For example:

- Invite students to create a scavenger hunt of the exhibit to invite further conversation. Each scavenger hunt task should require a conversation with the student experts at the exhibits to unveil the answers.

- Encourage those students who are enthusiastic about the project to create maps or guides for all the exhibits, to serve as “pamphlets” to hand to museum visitors.

- Allow students who show greater facility writing the museum labels to coach their classmates who could use support.

- Invite students to add matting to their labels and curator’s statements. Encourage students to consider the layout and design of their exhibit. Ask students to study and be inspired by professional museum curator designs, so that the museum looks as professional as possible.

- Allow students to photograph collections to make an online “catalog” of the exhibition, to remember the event and give access to parents or others who cannot visit the collections.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Throughout this unit, students have planned their exhibits and written their curator’s statements and labels, as well as practiced their presentations of them in preparation for the performance task.

Support All Students

- Continue to monitor students to determine if issues surface from the content of the works they’ve studied that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually.

- If students need more time to complete their labels, set up a working station with devices that students can visit when they have finished other class work. ▲

- Students may need additional support in completing their labels. Work in small groups with these students, or allocate a student expert to support students with this work. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson includes a workshop atmosphere that fosters flexible groupings, support, and time on tasks. Teachers can use this flexibility to create strategic groupings for one or more of the activities as needed as well as to provide individual support and extra time for ELLs to complete the tasks.

- ELLs may find it challenging to draft their labels. Encourage these students to work in pairs or small groups to identify the sentences they can use and adapt from the Model Curator’s Statement and Label in their own writing. If necessary, work with students to identify these sentences, change them into sentence frames, and model using them.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, 7.I.B.6, 7.I.C.10, and 7.I.C.12.

Assessment Guidance

- Review student work during and after the lesson either to provide specific feedback and suggestions or to identify common issues that could be used as whole group teaching points.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will launch the fourth module, on plastic pollution.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – SL.7.4 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lessons 13–14.**

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique to review their responses.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Write Exhibit Labels – SL.7.4 (20 minutes)

- Focus students on the **Performance Task anchor chart**, and remind them of the criteria for an effective label. Remind students that in this lesson, they will finish writing the labels for the pieces they selected for their exhibits and set up their exhibits and the museum overall to prepare for visitors.

- Display and ask students to retrieve their copies of the **Model Curator’s Statement and Label**. Reread the model label, or ask for a student volunteer to read the label they’ve already written about one of their pieces.

- Ask for student volunteers to share what they will keep in mind as they draft their remaining labels. (“We want to connect the works to the larger theme we’ve identified, as well as giving specific information about the piece. We want to engage the reader and create enthusiasm by using an appreciative and enthusiastic tone.”)

- Invite students to work independently on drafting their labels, focusing on the criteria they’ve identified. Encourage those students who finish drafting early to share their labels and provide feedback to each other. Invite students to type, print, and matte their labels or handwrite them in their best handwriting.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Times A, foster a workshop atmosphere by allowing for flexible groupings, support, and time on tasks. Then use this flexibility to create strategic groupings for one or more of the activities as needed as well as to provide individual support and extra time for students to complete the tasks. For example:

- Some students may need the support of orally rehearsing their ideas with a partner before writing their labels.

- Some students may not need as much time as is allotted for writing their labels and can use the extra time for revising with a peer.

- Some students may quickly finish their writing and revision in Work Time A and be ready to assist other students with their writing and revisions. Mentoring others solidifies their understanding of vocabulary and language structures and gives them additional opportunities to practice their speaking skills.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Times A, foster a workshop atmosphere by allowing for flexible groupings, support, and time on tasks. Then use this flexibility to create strategic groupings for one or more of the activities as needed as well as to provide individual support and extra time for students to complete the tasks. For example:

- Some students may need to work in pairs to small groups to write their labels. These groups can be homogeneous by language or content proficiency.

- Some students may need the support of orally rehearsing their ideas with a partner in English or in their home language before writing their labels.

- Some students may need teacher and peer support to identify sentences from the Model Curator’s Statement and Label that they can adapt and use in their own writing.

Work Time

B. Set Up Museum – SL.7.5 (20 minutes)

- Review appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can use visual displays to clarify and emphasize points in my museum exhibit.”

- Work with students to set the room up as a museum. Use posterboards, corkboards, or other material to display student work. Ask students:

“How can we make this museum look and feel like a professional museum?” (We can change the layout of the room, cover the tables with fabric or paper, change the lighting, set up a snack bar and gift shop, and remove the chairs. We could also display the museum in the school’s library or multipurpose room, or maybe even a location in the community.)

- Record the suggestions on chart paper to create a job list with a particular number of slots per job. Several students can take on the job of introducing the museum to visitors. They would need to briefly practice and plan what they will say, which should include welcoming visitors, orienting them to the museum space and the exhibits, encouraging them to use the **Museum Exhibit Questions anchor chart** and **compliment cards** to dialogue with students and give positive feedback. Invite students to choose the job they most want, if available, including helping to create the museum.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Times B, foster a workshop atmosphere by allowing for flexible groupings, support, and time on tasks. Then use this flexibility to create strategic groupings for one or more of the activities as needed as well as to provide individual support and extra time for students to complete the tasks. For example:

- Some students may need the support of orally rehearsing their ideas with a partner before writing their labels.

- Some students may not need as much time as is allotted for writing their labels and can use the extra time for revising with a peer.

- Some students may quickly finish their writing and revision in Work Time A and be ready to assist other students with their writing and revisions. Mentoring others solidifies their understanding of vocabulary and language structures and gives them additional opportunities to practice their speaking skills.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Times B, foster a workshop atmosphere by allowing for flexible groupings, support, and time on tasks. Then use this flexibility to create strategic groupings for one or more of the activities as needed as well as to provide individual support and extra time for students to complete the tasks. For example:

- Some students may need to work in pairs to small groups to write their labels. These groups can be homogeneous by language or content proficiency.

- Some students may need the support of orally rehearsing their ideas with a partner in English or in their home language before writing their labels.

- Some students may need teacher and peer support to identify sentences from the Model Curator’s Statement and Label that they can adapt and use in their own writing.

Closing and Assessment

A. Practice Conversations – SL.7.4 (15 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can use appropriate eye contact, adequate volume, and clear pronunciation to present my museum exhibit.”

“I can use formal English while presenting my museum exhibit.”

- Inform students that they will practice the kinds of conversations that are held when expert curators chat with museumgoers. To do so, they will participate in a Peer Critique protocol. Remind students that they participated in a Peer Critique protocol in Module 1. Display and distribute the **Peer Critique: Museum Exhibit Norms and Directions handout** and the **Peer Critique anchor chart**. Read aloud the handout and ask if anyone has any clarifying questions.

- To prepare for the conversation, ask students to create a list of the kinds of questions that might be asked about their exhibits. Using a total response technique, create a Museum Questions anchor chart.

- Discuss with students that the first step in this process is inviting and welcoming the museumgoer to the exhibit. Ask students to Turn and Talk about ways to do this. Use a total response technique to hear a few examples of ways to invite a museumgoer to the exhibit.

- Explain to students that the second step is to invite conversation:

“One way to invite conversation is to ask, ‘Is there anything you’d like to discuss with me about the exhibit? Do you have any questions for me?’”

- Explain to students that if the answer is “yes,” then the conversation is up and running. If the answer is “no,” then take the opportunity to explain aspects of the exhibit and discuss the curator’s statement. It’s important to keep the conversation going by inviting questions and explaining the exhibit when there aren’t any questions. Additionally, be sure to give museumgoers space and time to quietly read and reflect on what they’re seeing. Sometimes it takes people a bit of time to process before they’re able to come up with questions. Be sure to provide that time.

- Remind students that once the conversation is going, it’s important to use all that we’ve learned about discussion norms to keep it going. Display and review the **Discussion Norms** **anchor chart**.

- Invite students to join with a partner and decide who will be the exhibit curator and expert first, and who will be the museumgoer first. The first person to be the exhibit curator and expert is partner A, and the first person to be the museumgoer is partner B. Both partners will play both roles. The exhibit curator and expert will stand near their exhibit materials: their pieces, their curator’s statement, and their labels.

- Circulate among the partnerships. Prompt the partnerships as needed. After the first round of conversation has been completed, invite students to give and receive feedback by following the Peer Critique protocol. Invite students to switch roles, move to the other person’s exhibit, and follow the same steps.

For Lighter Support

- During Closing and Assessment A, some students may benefit from several rounds of practice conversations. Encourage these students to move on to new pairings when they finish one round of practice conversations.

For Heavier Support

- During Closing and Assessment A, some students may need additional support during the practice conversations to offer feedback. Before they begin the conversations, bring these students together to brainstorm and practice sentence frames they can use to provide feedback.

Closing and Assessment

B. Harlem Renaissance Museum – SL.7.4, SL.7.6 (30 minutes)

- Together with student presenters welcome the museumgoers, encouraging them to use the Museum Questions anchor chart to engage as many students in dialogue about their exhibits as they can. Provide **pens** and compliment cards at each exhibit for museumgoers who prefer to leave written notes for students. If museumgoers are fellow students, review norms for discussion, emphasizing that this is a celebratory activity and that constructive feedback is not appropriate at this time.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.
