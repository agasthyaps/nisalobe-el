(Example for Teacher Reference)

Throughout the module you have read poems and stories, listened to songs, and viewed visual and performing art from the Harlem Renaissance. You will now share these works with the world in a Harlem Renaissance Museum. It is important to share this museum with the world because the topic is timely and significant and because there are so few middle school resources available on the Harlem Renaissance.

In Unit 3, you have curated, or selected, a set of texts, songs, and artworks from the Harlem Renaissance. Additionally, you have curated a contemporary piece that you either found or made yourself. Together with your classmates, you will present your collection to a wider audience in a Harlem Renaissance Museum. Both a written and oral presentation of your curator’s statements along with the works themselves are part of your museum exhibit.

Your Museum Exhibit will include the following:

- At least three pieces from the Harlem Renaissance:

- Two texts (story, poem, essay)

- A song, dance, or work of art

- A related contemporary work that you found or made. This can be a story, poem, essay, song, dance, or piece of art.

- A curator’s statement about how the pieces you selected are important and connected by theme. Your curator’s statement will include the following:

- A title that explains the gist of the exhibit

- Context for the subject of the Harlem Renaissance

- The unifying theme between the works in the exhibit

- A hook that entices the viewer to explore the exhibit

- Titles of the works in the exhibit

- Evidence of an appreciative and enthusiastic tone

- Labels explaining each piece and how it connects to the other pieces. Your labels about each piece will include the following:

- The title, author, and medium of each piece

- A more detailed explanation of how a work develops a theme (including the use of language or structure if applicable)

- Engaging descriptions of the work

For your presentation:

- Present your exhibit, explaining each piece and how the pieces are connected in a focused, coherent manner using pertinent descriptions, facts, details, and examples.

- Use appropriate eye contact, adequate volume, and clear pronunciation.

- Include multimedia components and visual displays in your presentation to clarify claims and emphasize salient points.

- Use formal English throughout your presentation.

- Respond to visitors’ questions.
