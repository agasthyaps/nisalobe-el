5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

RI.7.4, SL.7.1, L.7.4, L.7.5c

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

Stop and experience the painting *Seascape*, by Palmer Hayden, and **discover the rows of birds flocking over a turbulent ocean**. (from the label for the “Weathering the Storm” model performance task)

**Lesson 7 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after students analyze the Model Curator’s Statement and Label in Work Time A.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target (**I can generate criteria for the curator’s statement of a museum exhibit on the Harlem Renaissance**) by serving as a model of an effective sentence in a label about a displayed work. The sentence also helps students address RL.7.4 and L.7.5c by featuring words with precise connotations (e.g., **turbulent**) to evoke a particular mood. Supporting standards: SL.7.1, L.7.4.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses vivid verbs and nouns and because it features verbs written in the imperative mood.

- Transfer: Evocative language and verbs in the imperative mood to add to their labels in the following lesson.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **Stop and experience the painting *Seascape*, by Palmer Hayden, and <u>discover the rows of birds flocking over a turbulent ocean</u>.**

- Ask:

“What is this sentence about?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“In what context was this sentence written? What is its purpose and intended audience?” (This sentence was written as part of a label to accompany a curated work in a class museum. It is meant to be read by those who visit the museum. Its purpose is to attract the museumgoer’s attention and incite interest in the displayed work.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **discover the rows of birds flocking over a turbulent ocean**.

- Invite students to close their eyes as the focus structure is read aloud and try to visualize the image being described.

- Ask:

“What do you imagine when you hear this chunk read aloud?” (Responses will vary, but may include: I imagine peaceful birds flying in a line over a sea; I imagine violent, rough waters).

“What words help create this image in your mind?” (Responses will vary, but may include: flocking, turbulent, or rows.)

- Draw student attention to the word **turbulent**. Invite students to use a learner’s dictionary to verify the meanings of the word **turbulent**; alternatively, display the following denotations:

1.  moving in an irregular or violent way

2.  full of confusion, violence, or disorder; not stable or steady

- Ask:

“Which definition, A or B, do you think is closest to the meaning of the word as it is used in this sentence? What makes you think so?” (Definition A is closest because the word is describing an ocean. It makes sense that the ocean would be moving in an irregular way; it makes less sense that the ocean would be full of confusion.)

“How does definition B help us understand the connotation of the word turbulent?” (Responses will vary, but may include: Definition B adds a feeling to the word that is not purely physical. Describing an ocean as turbulent does not just mean it is a rough sea. It may be that there is more chaos or disorder beneath the sea.)

“Can you figure out why the writer chose to use the word turbulent instead of a more ocean-specific synonym like choppy? Hint: think about the purpose and the context of the poem.” (Responses will vary, but may include: This poem was written during the Harlem Renaissance. The poet might have used the word turbulent to connect the idea of the rough ocean to the challenging circumstances of the time.)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **Stop and experience the painting *Seascape*, by Palmer Hayden, and <u>discover the rows of birds flocking over a turbulent ocean</u>.**

- Invite students to mark the three main verbs (**stop**, **experience**, **discover**) in this sentence on their note-catchers.

- Ask:

“What do you notice about these verbs?” (Responses will vary, but may include: they are single words; they are commands; they are telling the reader to do something.)

- Point out that these verbs are written in the imperative mood, meaning that they are given a direct command. Tell students that they will learn more about the imperative mood in Grade 8 as part of an important language standard (L.8.1c).

“In providing these commands, what does the writer want the reader to do?” (The writer wants the reader to engage with the displayed work.)

“How can you effectively use commands in your own labels for the museum?” (Responses will vary, but may include: I can include gentle commands to help guide the attention of the people visiting the museum; I can use commands to help stir up interest in the work I’ve curated.)

- Ask:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target:  
I can analyze a model curator’s statement and generate criteria such as descriptions and details about Harlem Renaissance text?” (Responses will vary. Note that the daily learning target mentions the curator’s statement, rather than the accompanying label; remind students that these pieces of their performance task are connected.)
