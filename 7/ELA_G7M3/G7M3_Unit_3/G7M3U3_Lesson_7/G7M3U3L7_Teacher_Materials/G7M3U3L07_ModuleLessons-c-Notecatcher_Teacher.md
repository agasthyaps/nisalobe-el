**Directions:** As you read and listen, provide quotes from the text in the spaces below the elements in the curator’s statement and example label.

**Curator’s Statement**

Context for the subject of the Harlem Renaissance:

In the 1920s the energy of the artistic world was focused on Harlem and the experience of black Americans overall. These artists were fighting for their right to be heard and to address themes that were important to them.

The unifying theme (and possible language or structure connections) between the works in the exhibit:

invites us to explore the theme that nature’s mysteries can teach us about how complex life can be

Titles of the works in the exhibit:

“Truth” by Nikki Grimes, “Storm Ending” by Jean Toomer, “Like a Strong Tree” by Claude McKay, and *Isle de Bonaventure* by Palmer Hayden invite us to explore the theme that nature’s mysteries can teach us about how complex life can be.

A hook to entice the viewer to explore the exhibit:

Experience these works with an eye to the past and the present, and perhaps they will remind you of the beauty and mystery all around us. They may even remind you of the beautiful surprises life can hold. Open your eyes, look around, and as Grimes says, “See where it heads!”

Evidence of an appreciative and enthusiastic tone:

“brought great beauty into the world”

“perhaps they will remind you of the beauty and mystery all around us”

**Label**

The title, author, and medium of each piece:

*Isle de Bonaventure* painting by Palmer Hayden

A more detailed explanation of how a work develops a theme (including the use of language or structure if applicable):

The painting reminds us of the complex swirl of life all around us, if we only look.

Engaging description of the work:

“The painting is full of light and life that only a true artist can bring to the world.”

What makes this an effective curator’s statement and label? What techniques will you use in your own curator’s statement and label?

The engaging tone and the information it gives the visitor make this an effective curator’s statement. I will also use a hook to engage the reader and appreciative language to explain why these works are important and beautiful.
