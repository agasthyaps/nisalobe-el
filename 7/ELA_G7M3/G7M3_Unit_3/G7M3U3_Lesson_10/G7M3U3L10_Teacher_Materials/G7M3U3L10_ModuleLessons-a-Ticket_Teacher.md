(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, respond to the following prompts.

Have you ever considered the way your elementary teachers held read-aloud picture books while you listened, or how weather reporters stand in front of maps while they present the weather? These people poise their bodies so that they don’t get in the way of the text and pictures. You can take some tips from teachers and weather reporters today as you go to present your exhibit, using visual displays.

Answers will vary, but may include: It’s important to keep in mind where I stand as I present.

Answers will vary, but may include: I should be sure to gesture to the visual displays, but not block my audience’s view of them.

How can you use your visual displays to clarify and emphasize points?

Answers will vary, but may include: I should gesture to the visual displays at key moments when I’m speaking about them, in order to clarify and emphasize points.
