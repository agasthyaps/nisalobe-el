Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- SL.7.5 – Opening A: On an entrance ticket, students consider techniques for incorporating visual displays into their presentation, and for clarifying and emphasizing points.

- SL.7.4 – Work Time A: Students practice presenting their museum exhibit, focusing on volume, eye contact, pronunciation, clarity, and emphasis.

- SL.7.6 – Work Time A: Students demonstrate awareness of a formal museum audience as they practice their presentations.

- SL.7.4 – Work Time B: Students engage in a Tuning protocol to practice and improve presentation skills such as adequate volume, eye contact, and clear pronunciation.

- SL.7.4 – Closing and Assessment A: Students debrief the Tuning protocol for adequate volume, eye contact, and clear pronunciation.

- In this lesson, students focus on contributing to a better world by improving their presentation skills for the class, the school, the community, and even the world.

- The Tuning protocol is used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- Students practice presenting their curator’s statements and labels before and during the Tuning protocol.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release more responsibility more quickly to students as they comprehend the tasks or concepts. For example:

- Allow those students who are skilled with presentation skills to offer their services as “expert presenters” to other groups who may need some modeling of presentation skills.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students focused on gathering materials for their exhibit and drafting and tuning their curator’s statement and label. In this lesson, students look more closely at how to improve the oral presentation of their exhibit.

Support All Students

- The subject matter of the museum exhibits may include descriptions of racism and prejudice. Continue to monitor students to determine if issues surface from the content of the podcast scripts needs to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually.

- Students may need additional support providing feedback in the Tuning protocol. They may need to listen to their classmates’ exhibit presentation more than once. Provide these students with a copy of the curator’s statement and label for them to read ahead of time to familiarize themselves with the content and possible issues they may recommend. Also, if possible, create a recording of the presentations and give students the opportunity to listen to the recording multiple times, in a quieter space, before providing feedback. ▲

- Provide students with the opportunity to move to quieter spaces in the classroom or use “office cubbies” to support their focus during the presentation practice and Tuning protocol. ▲

- Invite students to voice-record their revisions to their exhibit presentation if writing or typing while listening to feedback is too challenging. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson includes teacher modeling of a presentation and peer support in a Tuning Protocol. Both supports set students up for success on their end of unit assessment presentations.

- ELLs may find it challenging to give an oral presentation. One reason for this may be a concern that they may say something incorrectly. Ensure that all students understand that they must practice the habits of character of empathy, compassion, and respect. Explain that some students might need extra care and encouragement with giving presentations. Ensure that those students who are nervous or embarrassed are paired with students who frequently exhibit empathy, compassion, and respect. Also, allow those students who would prefer to give their presentation in their home language to do so with a partner who is fluent in the same home language.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1 and 7.I.B.5.

Assessment Guidance

- Circulate as students present their curator’s statement and label, ensuring they are practicing and improving their presentation skills. Also, review students’ Presentation checklists to ensure success on the End of Unit 3 Assessment.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will present their curator’s statement and label for the End of Unit 3 Assessment.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – SL.7.5 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 10**.

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique to review sample responses.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

- To promote independence on the entrance ticket, challenge students to record their responses first and then as necessary share them with a partner. Grappling first will increase students’ confidence and success on independent tasks such as assessments.

For Heavier Support

- To promote independence on the entrance ticket, challenge students to use the words in the questions to form sentence frames to answer the questions. They can answer them independently. As necessary, students can share their frames and responses with a partner. Grappling first will increase students’ confidence and success on independent tasks such as assessments.

Work Time

A. Practice Exhibit Presentation – SL.7.4, SL.7.5, SL.7.6 (15 minutes)

- Review appropriate learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can present my curator’s statement in a formal, focused, and clear way, emphasizing important points.”

“I can use appropriate eye contact, adequate volume, and clear pronunciation to present.”

“I can use visual displays in my presentation and exhibit to clarify and emphasize points.”

- Display and ask students to retrieve their **Presentation checklists** and focus on the following criteria:

- SL.7.4: I use adequate volume. I use appropriate eye contact. I use clear pronunciation.

- SL.7.5: I include multimedia components and visual displays in presentations to clarify claims and findings and emphasize salient points.

- SL.7.6: I adapt speech to a variety of contexts and tasks, demonstrating command of formal English when indicated or appropriate.

- Invite students to text code, mark, highlight, or annotate these criteria, as they will be the focus of the Tuning protocol. Have students Turn and Talk to say the criteria in their own words, recording these paraphrases in the third column of their Presentation checklists. As necessary, model doing so with one of the criteria, recording paraphrases on the board for students to reference. Consult the **Presentation checklist (example for teacher reference)** for sample responses.

- Explain to students that in this lesson they will practice presenting their exhibit for a partner, coaching each other on clarity, emphasis of important points, eye contact, adequate volume, clear pronunciation, and formal English. Additionally, they will support one another with their use of visual displays to clarify and emphasize points. Their visual display is the visual or multimedia piece from their exhibit. Display **Palmer Hayden’s** ***Isle de Bonaventure*** and the **Model Curator’s Statement and Label** to model presenting. Read the label aloud:

“Stop and experience the painting *Isle de Bonaventure*, by Palmer Hayden, and discover the rows of birds flocking over a turbulent ocean.”

- Gesture toward the birds. Continue reading:

“The clouds hang overhead.”

- Gesture toward the clouds. Continue reading:

“And the painting is full of light and life that only a true artist can bring to the world.”

- Gesture toward the light. Continue reading:

“The painting reminds us of the complex swirl all around us, if we only look.”

- Gesture toward the complex swirl. Ask students to Turn and Talk to discuss how the visual is used to clarify and emphasize points.

“How could students who chose or created a song or dance for their visual share it effectively with museum-goers?” (Responses will vary, but may include: Students can play a recording of the song or dance and pause it at a few points to explain the piece and its connection to other works. If students are singing or dancing live as part of their exhibit, they can explain their piece and its connections before they begin, perform it, and then add additional explanations.)

- Encourage students to also share with their partner how they will use their own visuals to clarify and emphasize points.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

B. Tuning Protocol: Presentation Skills – SL.7.4 (20 minutes)

- Explain to students that they will now present their exhibit to a partner to get feedback on their presentation skills.

- Move students into partnerships, and invite them to label themselves A and B.

- Distribute **sticky notes**.

- Focus students on the **Work to Contribute to a Better World anchor chart**, specifically “I use my strengths to help others grow.” Remind students that as they work to critique their partner’s work, they will need to use their strengths.

- Tell students they are going to provide their partner with kind, specific, and helpful feedback against the criterion.

- Direct students’ attention to the **Peer Critique anchor chart**, and remind them of what peer critique looks and sounds like.

- Display and distribute **Directions for a Tuning Protocol**, and review them as necessary. Remind students that they have participated in a Tuning protocol in the previous lesson. Invite students to share issues, solutions, and best practices for Tuning protocols.

- Ask students to retrieve their **curator’s statement and label, accompanying exhibit piece**, and Presentation checklists. Encourage them to provide feedback to their classmates based on the Presentation checklist. Remind students to consider their peers’ use of language. Are they using formal English? Are they using conventions so that everyone can understand what they mean?

- Circulate to support students as they work to give feedback to one another.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- Before students begin the Tuning protocol in Work Time B, ensure that they understand the purpose of the activity, which is to not only practice their presentation skills for the end of unit assessment but to prepare them to give the presentation to visitors at their Harlem Renaissance Museum. Also, these presentation skills are important for future school and career success. Knowing the authentic purpose of a task increases students’ engagement and effort.

- During Work Time B, circulate to listen and formatively assess students’ presentations to ensure that they are ready for the end of unit assessment in the following lesson. If not, consider spending another lesson on presentation skills practice and Tuning protocols.

Closing and Assessment

A. Debrief Tuning Protocol – SL.7.4 (5 minutes)

- Invite students to debrief the Tuning protocol. Ask the following questions:

“What did you enjoy about the Tuning protocol?”

“What are you taking away from this process related to presentation skills?”

“How will you improve your presentation tomorrow based on the Tuning protocol?”

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- In addition to or instead of the debriefing activity in Closing and Assessment A, encourage students to take a few moments to reflect on their learning. Use the following questions to prompt reflection:

- What have you learned about the curator’s statements and labels? Why do people write them? What do they tell museum visitors? What have you learned about presentations? What are some important things to remember when giving a presentation?

- What new vocabulary or language structures did you learn in this lesson?

Encourage students to share the most important or exciting thing they learned in this lesson. Reflecting on learning allows students to more firmly grasp abstract concepts and gives them confidence and ownership over their own learning.
