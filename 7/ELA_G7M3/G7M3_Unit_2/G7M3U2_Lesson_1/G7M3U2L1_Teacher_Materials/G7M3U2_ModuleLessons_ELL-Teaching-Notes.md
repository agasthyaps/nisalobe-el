English Language Learners: Grade 7: Module 3: Unit 2: Teaching Notes

The Context of the Harlem Renaissance

Teaching Notes for Unit 2

Prioritize Lessons for Classrooms with Many English Language Learners

To prepare students for the mid-unit reading assessment, consider prioritizing and expanding instruction in Lessons 2–5, which guide students to analyze how story elements interact and how the authors develop and contrast different points of view. Lessons 8–11 prepare students for the end of unit literary argument essay assessment by allowing them to work as a class to analyze a model literary argument essay and work in pairs to write a practice literary argument essay. Consider expanding these lessons to ensure students have enough time to comprehend the parts of the model essay and write their own pair essay paragraphs.

Language Dives

In Lessons 6–7, 9, and 12, students participate in Language Dives. In Lessons 6–7, the Language Dive focuses on a sentence from Nikki Grimes’ poem “The Sculptor” to guide students to analyze figurative language and its development of theme. The Language Dive in Lesson 9 guides students to analyze the main claim statement from the model literary argument essay. Students learn what makes an effective main claim statement so that they can write one in both their pair and independent literary argument essays. In Lesson 12, the Language Dive focuses on a sentence from the conclusion of the model literary argument essay, again allowing students to explore the effectiveness of the sentence and apply this learning to their own writing.

A Language Dive empowers students to analyze, understand, and use the language of academic sentences, which often seems opaque to students. During a Language Dive, students slow down for 10–20 minutes to have a conversation about the meaning, purpose, and structure of a compelling sentence from a complex text, or from a learning target, checklist, or rubric included in the curriculum. Following the engaging deconstruct-reconstruct-practice routine of the Language Dive, students play with the smallest “chunks” of the sentence, interpreting them, rearranging them, or using them to talk about their own lives. As a result of paying close attention to how language works, all students begin to acquire the necessary facility with academic English, and ELLs foster their overall language ability. A consistent Language Dive routine is critical in helping all students learn how to decipher complex sentences and write their own.

Most Language Dives implicitly address a wide range of Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening, and Language standards. Once teachers are comfortable with Language Dives, they may choose to supplement the focus standards in a particular Language Dive with additional standards to meet their students’ needs. Note that the Rationale section of each Language Dive also identifies supporting standards that are explicitly addressed but are not the main focus of the Language Dive.

Note that the Language Dive guides have been condensed in Module 3 as a way to reduce the amount of reading expected of teachers. Refer to the general best practices laid out in the Module 1 and Module 2 Language Dive guides.

Language Chunk Wall

Continue to use the “Language Chunk Wall” to extend student capacity to use Language Dive structures. The Language Chunk Wall is an area in the classroom where students can display and categorize the academic phrases discussed in each Language Dive. At the end of each Language Dive, students are invited to place the Language Dive sentence chunk strips on the Language Chunk Wall into corresponding categories, such as “Nouns and noun phrases” or “Linking language.” See each Language Dive for suggested categories. Consider color-coding each category for additional support, for example, blue for nouns and subjects; purple for pronouns; red for predicates and verbs; yellow for adjectives; and green for adverbs, prepositions, and conjunctions. Students can then refer to the wall during subsequent speaking and writing tasks.

Mini Language Dives

Students have an opportunity to participate in Mini Language Dives beginning in Module 2, Unit 1. Mini Language Dives have the same overall purpose and follow the same general process as full Language Dives, but are condensed to 5 minutes, narrowing students’ attention on deconstructing the focus structure, reconstructing the sentence, and practicing the focus structure. Mini Language Dives give ELLs additional support in building language and literacy skills, as well as habits of mind. Mini Language Dives are most often optional and can be found in the corresponding lessons within this guide. In this unit, optional Mini Language Dives appear in Lessons 3 and 11.

Diversity and Inclusion

Investigate the routines, practices, rituals, beliefs, norms, and experiences that are important to ELLs and their families. Integrate this background into the classroom as students engage with texts. Consider the values and narratives embedded in class texts and try to anticipate their relevance to ELLs. Foster inclusive action by creating space for students to express their feelings about sensitive issues or content embedded in the text(s), knowing that these discussions may help create equity, amplify student voices, or unearth trauma. Consult with a guidance counselor, school social worker, or ESL teacher for further investigation of diversity and inclusion.

Conversation Cues

Encourage productive and equitable conversation with Conversation Cues, which are questions to ask students that help achieve four goals:

- (Goal 1) encourage all students to talk and be understood;

- (Goal 2) listen carefully to one another and seek to understand;

- (Goal 3) deepen thinking; and

- (Goal 4) think with others to expand the conversation (adapted from Michaels, Sarah, and Cathy O’Connor. *Talk Science Primer*. TERC, 2012. http://inquiryproject.terc.edu/shared/pd/TalkScience_Primer.pdf. Based on Chapin, S., O’Connor, C., and Anderson, N. \[2009\]. *Classroom Discussions: Using Math Talk to Help Students Learn, Grades K–6*. Second Edition. Math Solutions Publications).

Refer to the Tools Page (http://eled.org/tools) for the complete set of cues. Goal 1 Conversation Cues were introduced in Module 1, Unit 1; Goal 2 Conversation Cues in Module 1, Unit 3; Goal 3 Conversation Cues in Module 2, Unit 2; and Goal 4 Conversation Cues in Module 3, Unit 1. Suggestions for integrating Conversation Cues into instruction are presented across lessons. For ELLs, Conversation Cues are especially critical to help improve language-processing abilities and increase engagement and participation.

Use Conversation Cues as often as possible to gradually release thinking and expression of ideas to students; avoid using Conversation Cues as a way of searching for the “right” answer. Students often struggle to create productive and equitable conversation during Turn and Talk or Think-Pair-Share protocols; Conversation Cues can make the difference. Recall that the main goals of Conversation Cues are supporting students to express their ideas (Goal 1), listen to other students’ ideas (Goal 2), deepen their own ideas (Goal 3), and build on other students’ ideas (Goal 4).

Consider this model transcription from a classroom where about 85% of students are ELLs. The teacher is supporting students to build their ideas about the choice an author made when writing this sentence about an athlete’s factors for success: *There were many factors that led to Rickey’s success, but it was support from others in baseball that was most important*. Students can carry the Conversation Cues into small groups to support their own independent productive and equitable conversations.

Mr. Valencia: What if I replace **but** with **and**? **And** is also a conjunction. How would **and** change the meaning? I'll give you some time to think. Emma, you want to give it a shot?

Emma: It is adding on to the, like, the idea, of the first (part of the) sentence?

Mr. Valencia: Can anyone repeat or rephrase what Emma just said?

Santiago: It would have the same idea as the first two chunks.

Mr. Valencia: Right, **and** would have the same idea as the first two chunks. Two connecting, same ideas. So how does **but** change that for me? Jazmin?

Jazmin: **But** would change it.

Mr. Valencia: Can you say more about that, Jazmin?

Jazmin: It would change it because **but** would say there are many things happening, but this is the one.

Mr. Valencia: So does anyone want to add something else to that?

Daniel: **But** is saying this is the main thing happening.

Mr. Valencia: Right, now the sentence is going to the main factor (for success), or a contrast. **But** is something that is going to tell us a contrast. (Exchange continues.)

Strategic Grouping

Students work in pairs and small groups to analyze texts and prepare for text-based discussions. While reading the anchor text in class, students can read independently, in pairs or small groups, or as a full class. In earlier lessons, as students begin the anchor text, consider matching ELLs with a partner who has greater language proficiency. The conversations and reading support that occur as a result of such strategic pairing will greatly serve the language development of both partners. In later lessons, consider cultivating ELLs’ autonomy and flexibility by encouraging them to vary their reading habits.

Differentiated Materials

Differentiated (▲) materials are available for ELLs and other students who would benefit from an increased level of support. These resources have been modified for the purposes of creating accessibility to content and concepts and supporting language development. Depending upon the task being carried out, images, selected response options, answer banks, sentence frames, or model responses have been embedded to guide students’ thinking without compromising a focus on standards and the skills that students are developing and applying to meet them.

Celebration

Celebrate the courage, enthusiasm, diversity, and bilingual assets that ELLs bring to the classroom. Additionally, students can celebrate their successful attempts at communication and their ability to extend and enhance the discussions.
