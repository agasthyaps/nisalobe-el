RL.7.1

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, respond to the following prompts.

1.  Look at the artwork *The Great Migration* by Jacob Lawrence. What do you see? What do you wonder? Read the captions. What ideas is Lawrence conveying with these images?

I see ideas about a labor shortage, migration, devastation, poverty, injustice, lynching, discrimination, living conditions, housing, illness, education, gender, and freedom.

2.  What do you think is going on?

People are moving from the South to the North to seek a better life.

3.  The word **migration** means moving from one region to another. How does this definition help you understand the artwork? What do you think is happening? Where are people moving from and to? What makes you think so?

The word “migration” helps you understand that it is about people moving from the South to the North to seek a better life. The captions and images help me understand the context of the paintings.

4.  Does this artwork connect to other works you’ve seen from the Harlem Renaissance? Explain why or why not.

These works connect to Georgia Douglas Johnson’s “Calling Dreams,” because it’s about migrating because of the dream of a better life.
