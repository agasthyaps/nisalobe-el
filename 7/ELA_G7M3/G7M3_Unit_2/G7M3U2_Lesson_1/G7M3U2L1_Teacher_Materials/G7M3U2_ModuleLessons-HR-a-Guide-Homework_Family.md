![](media/image1.png) Guiding Questions and Big Ideas

What are some of the historical factors surrounding and contributing to the Harlem Renaissance?

- *Some societal factors that contributed to the movement and its art are the Great Migration, Jim Crow laws, and the racial violence of post-Civil War America. This migration, struggle, and oppression create urgency and frustration, out of which comes an expression of culture and identity. Out of the migration came a new freedom to create.*

What will your student be doing at school?

Students begin the unit exploring the context of the Harlem Renaissance, noting how the Harlem Renaissance occurred during the Great Migration, Jim Crow laws, and the racial violence of post-Civil War America.

To gain this background knowledge, students read short informational texts and examine visual art related to the social and political context of the Harlem Renaissance. Then students read the short story “His Motto” by Lottie Burrell Dixon, which is about a young black boy named Robert Hilton who through innovation, initiative, and determination helps a wealthy white businessman send an essential telegram and earns himself a job as a result. Students also read the short story “The Boy and the Bayonet” by Paul Laurence Dunbar, which is also about a young black boy, who is devastated when he makes a mistake in a school military drill, but through the encouragement of his mother and sister, returns to school to earn the praise of the school leaders and respect of his peers. As students read these two short stories, they explore character, plot, and setting, noting how these story elements interact and affect each other.

Students also analyze how the authors develop and contrast the different points of view of the characters. For example, in “His Motto,” the wealthy businessman and Robert have different points of view of the boy’s ability to help. Robert is confident of his abilities throughout, but the businessman’s point of view on this changes as he sees Robert’s determination and success. Additionally, students examine the themes the stories develop such as working hard to achieve dreams and how community helps to bring out our best selves. For the mid-unit assessment, students examine the third part of “The Boy and the Bayonet” for how particular elements of a story interact and how the author develops and contrasts the points of view of different characters.

In the second half of the unit, students continue to explore the context of the Harlem Renaissance by analyzing how the theme of looking to the past for strength and hope connects three pieces of artwork and text from the Harlem Renaissance. Students begin this work by examining a model literary argument essay and discussing the theme connecting the three works. Then, students study the introduction, Proof Paragraphs, and conclusion of the model literary argument essay, as they work collaboratively to plan and write their own pair literary argument essay. This pair essay explores the theme of how collaboration and community bring out the best in people.

In the end of unit assessment, students independently write their own literary argument essay about the three works from the Harlem Renaissance connected by the theme of dreams giving life meaning and purpose.

Central to the EL Education curriculum is a focus on “habits of character” and social-emotional learning. Students work to become effective learners, developing mindsets and skills for success in college, career, and life (e.g., initiative, responsibility, perseverance, collaboration); work to become ethical people, treating others well and standing up for what is right (e.g., empathy, integrity, respect, compassion); and work to contribute to a better world, putting their learning to use to improve communities (e.g., citizenship, service).

In this unit, students explore how the characters in the short story exhibit habits of character. For example, both Robert and Bud, the main characters in “His Motto” and “The Boy and the Bayonet” demonstrate determination and perseverance to achieve their dreams. Robert also demonstrates initiative and responsibility when he solves the wealthy businessman’s dilemma. Bud’s mother and sister demonstrate compassion and empathy throughout the story, supporting Bud before and after his mistake.

Students themselves practice habits of character as they show respect, empathy, and compassion when responding to one another’s ideas and skills in written work and in discussions. Students also practice collaboration as they write the pair essay. They practice integrity and perseverance as they work independently on assessments. Students also take responsibility for their own learning as they track progress on their assessments.

How can you support your student at home?

Explore informational texts with your student about the Great Migration, Jim Crow laws, or racial violence of the 1900s. Read short stories written by black Americans during the Harlem Renaissance. You may use questions such as the following for your conversations:

- What was the Great Migration? What caused it? What were Jim Crow laws? What are some examples of Jim Crow laws? What kinds of violent acts were black Americans victims of in the 1900s? How did the Great Migration, Jim Crow laws, and racial violence affect black Americans? How were these societal factors related to the Harlem Renaissance?

- Who are the main characters in the story? What are they like? What is the setting or time and place of the story? What are the main plot events? How does the setting influence the characters or plot events?

- What are the points of view of the different characters about one of the main plot events? How are these points of view the same? How are they different? How do you know the different characters’ points of view? How does the author develop them? Through characters’ dialogue, thoughts, actions?

Unit 2: Homework

In Lessons 1, 6–7, and 15–16, students write QuickWrites to reflect on ideas or topics from the lesson.

In Lessons 2–5, students preread the part of the short story they will analyze in class, defining unfamiliar vocabulary.

In Lessons 8–14, students complete sentence frames to explain the use of phrases or clauses and choose different types of sentences in their own and model literary argument essays.

In Lessons 8–16, homework focuses on research reading for which students read a topic-related book of choice and answer a question related to the unit’s ideas and skills.

Research Reading: When not reading their anchor text, your student is expected to independently research the topic by reading topic-related books of his or her choice for approximately 20 minutes each day and responding to a prompt of choice in the front of the independent reading journal. These are usually books your student will bring home from school; however, they may be topic-related books chosen by the student at the public or your home library. Prompts for independent reading can be found in the homework materials provided below.

Independent Reading

**Directions:** Remember to record responses to research reading in the front of your independent reading journal and responses to choice reading in the back. Try to choose a different prompt each time.

Record any new vocabulary in your vocabulary log. Underline vocabulary found during independent reading.

**Record:**

- Date

- Title and author of your reading book

- Pages you have read

- Prompt

- Response

**Example:**

<u>Date:</u> 01/30/19

<u>Book Title and Author:</u> “Harlem Renaissance Packet” by EL Education

<u>Pages Read:</u> N/A

<u>Prompt:</u> How did the artists, musicians, and writers interact with each other? How did this collaboration affect their work?

<u>Response:</u> The authors of *Shuffle Along* collaborated to create the story, music, and lyrics of the show. They also collaborated with actors and musicians to perform the show. This collaboration produced a musical that was so popular it changed musical theater forever by combining a story with music and dance.

**Consider using the following independent reading prompts.**[^1]

- Who were the important people involved in this movement? What impact did they have on the movement?

- How did the artists, musicians, and writers interact with each other? How did this collaboration affect their work?

- What are some historical factors surrounding this period? How did these historical factors influence the artists, musicians, and writers and their work?

- What is the legacy of the Harlem Renaissance? How has it impacted art, music, and literature today?

- Choose one new word from your reading today and analyze it on a vocabulary square.

| **Definition in your own words**                  | **Synonyms** (words with the same meaning) |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Words with the same affix or root**             | **Sketch**                                 |
| **Translation in home language** (if appropriate) |                                            |

Vocabulary

**Directions:** In the classroom, you have been recording words from your texts in your vocabulary log. Throughout this unit, you have been researching reading topic-related books at home to build your knowledge of epidemics and recording words in your independent reading journal.

Choose a word from your research reading or from a text you’ve read in class and add the word to your vocabulary log. Try to choose a different word to add and to practice a different vocabulary strategy each time. For each word, be sure to add the following:

1.  The definition, or meaning, of the word

2.  The vocabulary strategy you used to figure out the meaning of the word

3.  A sketch or diagram that helps you to better understand the meaning of the word

Record new vocabulary in vocabulary logs and mark academic vocabulary with a symbol, for example, a star:

- Academic vocabulary: words you might find in informational texts on many different topics. For example, the words *evidence* and *rationale* are words that could be found in books on any topic.

- Domain-specific vocabulary: words about a particular topic. For example, the words *tadpoles*, *frogspawn*, and *amphibian* are some that would be found on the topic of frogs.

**Vocabulary Strategies**

As a reminder, the vocabulary strategies we’ve been working on in class are listed below:

- Context: Read the sentence around the word.

- Look at the affixes for clues.

- Look at the root of the word for clues.

- Use a dictionary.

- Discuss the word with another person (after attempting some of the above strategies).

[^1]: Some of the prompts will not be appropriate for the text students are reading. Invite students to choose a prompt that works for the text they have just read.
