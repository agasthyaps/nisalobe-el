**Directions:** Draw boxes on chart paper as shown in the diagram below to create one response chart for each group. Then students will record key details from their group’s discussion of the mystery text (student 1), the common text (student 2), the expert texts (student 3), and all the texts (student 4). Possible student responses are below the diagram.

Scribe Concepts for EL Education.

Student 1: Mystery Text: *The Crisis* Cover: Springarn Medal

• Woman standing holding a scale in one hand and a sword in the other.

• She is blindfolded.

• Above her is an Egyptian-type figure.

• Why is she blindfolded? Why is there an Egyptian-type figure above her?

• The title of the magazine is *The Crisis*, which means an emergency.

• The name of the picture is the Springarn Medal.

• We learned that the woman is a symbol of justice. She is blindfolded, so that she can be truly impartial, applying justice without being influenced by people’s skin color, money, power, or status.

• Black Americans weren’t always treated impartially in 1914, so they would want their justice system to be impartial, blind to their skin color and be truly just.

Student 2: “Under Jim Crow’s Thumb” by Elizabeth Tenney

• 1861–1865, blacks were freed, made citizens, and men could vote. They became jurors and politicians.

• But soon Southern whites began to make laws that kept blacks from voting and from public places. They also used violence and terrorism to keep blacks from their rights.

• Jim Crow laws took away black people’s rights. These laws were in place for nearly 100 years.

Student 3: Expert Texts:
