**The Harlem Renaissance: A Cultural Rebirth**

**by James Hall**

Great waves of African Americans migrated to northern cities to take advantage of the many factory jobs that opened up in response to World War I (1914–1918). Unfortunately, social attitudes of the early 20th century forced these black folks to settle in segregated urban housing. So, they created bustling black metropolises—cities within cities.[^1] This caused a period of remarkable artistic and intellectual activity in New York City’s African American community, leading to the Harlem Renaissance.[^2]

While other cities saw similar developments and had their own rebirths, at the time New York City was very much the cultural capital of the United States. It was a publishing and writing center, home to most of the significant museums and galleries, and site of major music venues.[^3] Thus, the largely African American neighborhood called Harlem, located in northern Manhattan, is viewed as the starting point of the modern black artistic movement. From around 1923 to the beginning of the Great Depression in 1929, black writers and artists who gathered in Harlem generated an extraordinary amount and diversity of conversation, debate, and culture.

An important first impact of the Harlem Renaissance was the wide range of political action taken by both organizations and individuals who demanded improvements in African American economic and educational opportunities. After black soldiers had participated honorably during World War I, they hoped to come back to an America ready to accept and recognize their contributions and accomplishments. But outbreaks of racial violence due to the legality of Jim Crow laws often dashed these hopes.[^4]

Legal protection then, especially against lynching, became a priority for African Americans.[^5] Organizations such as the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the National Urban League, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) all had headquarters in New York.[^6] They started magazines, held rallies and marches, and argued their ideas in all kinds of ways.

Though the political beliefs of each group differed, they shared the conviction that it was time for the emergence of a “new Negro” in both person and attitude, one who was no longer willing to accept the status quo.[^7] Indeed, many historians believe that “New Negro Movement” is a more accurate term for the development of black life in the 1920s than “Harlem Renaissance.”

A number of individuals, including W.E.B. Du Bois, James Weldon Johnson, and Arthur Schomburg, began to reflect on how cultural activity might aid the African American community in its struggle.

**A Call to Move**

**by Barbara D. Krasner-Khait**

“There’s a storm of our people toward the north and especially to your city . . . . Will you please assist us in securing places as we are anxious to come by want jobs before we leave? We want to do any kind of honest labor. Our chance here is so poor.”

A group of Jacksonville, Florida, women wrote this letter on April 28, 1917, to *The Chicago Defender*, a widely read black newspaper in the South. The paper, which was edited by Robert Abbott, the son of former Georgia slaves, first appeared in 1905 as a one-page handbill. Within 10 years, it was a major force in encouraging African Americans to leave the South.

At first, Abbott wrote that southern African Americans should “stick to the farm.” However, with the advent of World War I and the new job opportunities it introduced, Abbott became a staunch believer life would be better for African Americans in the North. By 1916, he was urging them to leave and had dubbed his campaign, the “Great Northern Drive.” Abbott invited all southern African Americans “to come north” and fill “places for 1,500,000 working men in the cities of the North.” He even set a date—May 15, 1917—for the event and called it the Second Emancipation. Using the slogan “The Flight Out of Egypt” and promoting the songs “Going to Canaan” and “Bound for the Promised Land,” Abbott compared this “emancipation” to the exodus or departure of the Israelites from Egypt in the 13th century B.C.

To further the movement, the *Defender* carried headlines and articles that promoted the exodus and life in the northern cities. Then, to make the idea of moving seem even better, the paper detailed the benefits of the North in stak contrast to the tragic reports of life in the South. Black railroad porters also spread Abbott’s message and the *Defender* at their railroad stops.

Carpenters, **glaziers**, railroad workers, day laborers, janitors, clerks, molders, maids, cooks, painters, and others answered the call to move. They wrote the *Defender* seeking more information, and responded to the paper’s “help wanted” ads. On May 2, 1917, one *Defender* reader from New Orleans wrote, “Nearly the whole of the south is getting ready for the drive or excursion as it is termed. Please write at once. We are sick to get out of the solid south.” Following the *Defender’s* example, other newspapers such as the *New York Age* and the *Pittsburg Courier* called out to African Americans in the South as well. The result? In 1910, 44,000 black lived in Chicago. Just 10 years later, there were 109,000, and by 1930, 234,000. The Great Migration—the first mass movement of African Americans in the South to northern cities—had begun.

**Glaziers** are people whose work is cutting glass and setting it in windows.
