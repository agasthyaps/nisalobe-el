**Under Jim Crow’s Thumb by Elizabeth Tenney**

Discrimination against blacks in America dates back to the arrival of the first slaves in the early 1600s. But in the years after the Civil War (1861–1865), Congress passed the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth amendments to the Constitution to protect the rights of former slaves. These amendments abolished slavery, declared everyone born in the country a citizen, and gave black men the right to vote, which they did in large numbers. For the first time, African Americans sat on juries and were elected to government offices.

These freedoms were short-lived, however. Even before the federal government withdrew its troops from the South in 1877 at the end of Reconstruction, blacks came under attack from southern white supremacists. Whites used poll taxes, literacy tests, and other discriminatory regulations to keep African Americans away from voting booths. They also relied on terrorism and fraud to frighten black citizens who tried to exercise their rights. These practices, known as Jim Crow laws, were named for an obedient and uncomplaining black character that was popular in 19th-century minstrel shows.

The Jim Crow system was aimed at segregating, or separating, blacks from whites in public settings and in many areas of private life in the South. These laws stated that black people had to ride in separate railway cars and could sit only in the backs of buses. Blacks could not drink from white drinking fountains, eat in white restaurants, live in white neighborhoods, or attend white schools. In court, African Americans had to swear on separate Bibles. They could not be admitted to white hospitals or be buried in white cemeteries. Laws were passed forbidding blacks and whites from marrying one another.

Then, in the 1896 case of Plessy v. Ferguson, the U.S. Supreme Court determined that segregated train cars were legal as long as “separate but equal” facilities were provided for white and black people. In truth, most facilities for blacks were never as good as those for whites; in fact, they often were much worse. The Jim Crow laws and the 1896 Supreme Court decision made African Americans second-class citizens and prevented them from enjoying equal opportunities in society. Sixty years would pass before another Supreme Court decision abolished the system of Jim Crow laws.

Supremacists are people who believe that one group is better than another.

**Fast Fact**

In one South Carolina mill, black factory workers were not allowed to look out the same window as white workers.
