End of Unit 2 Assessment, Part I: Write a Literary Argument Essay

**Name:** **Date:**

**Write an Essay**

**Directions:** As a curator, you have decided to create a Harlem Renaissance exhibit focusing on the theme of the power of dreams to motivate people and bring a sense of purpose to life. Choose three works that most powerfully illustrate this theme, and plan and write an argument essay defending your claim about why these works are such a powerful illustration of this theme.

REMEMBER: A well-written literary argument

- includes an introduction giving readers the context they need to understand the topic or text;

- fairly acknowledges the counter-argument;

- clearly states a claim and stays focused on supporting that claim throughout the piece;

- uses accurate and relevant evidence and reasoning to support the points;

- groups information logically, in a way that makes the points clear to the reader;

- uses words and phrases to connect the reasons to the claim;

- includes a conclusion supporting the argument and restates the claim;

- uses a formal style; and

- follows rules of writing (spelling, punctuation, and grammar).
