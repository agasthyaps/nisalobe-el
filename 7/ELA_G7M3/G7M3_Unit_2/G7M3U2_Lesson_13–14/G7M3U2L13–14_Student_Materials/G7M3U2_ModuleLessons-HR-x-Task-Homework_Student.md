Other Definitions:**

**dependent clause:** a group of words with a subject and verb that doesn’t tell a complete thought; modifies or tells more about the independent clause

**independent clause:** a group of words with a subject and verb that tells a complete thought

**phrase:** a group of words that modifies or tells more about a noun, verb, or adverb in a sentence

**Directions:** Review your text codes. If you find you don’t have a variety of sentence types, revise some sentences to vary the types. Consider which sentences can be combined or which sentences can be split to make the information clearer. Also, consider whether you want to add phrases to modify or tell more about any nouns or verbs in your sentences. (L.7.1a, L.7.1b)
