W.7.1b Supports point with relevant evidence such as quotes from the text and reasoning that explains the evidence.

The writers and artists of the Harlem Renaissance had many messages to convey, but one of the most important was the power of dreams to motivate people and bring a sense of purpose to life. Many of the works of the Harlem Renaissance showed how important dreams are to one’s life. Of the works we’ve studied so far, however, the story “His Motto” and the poems “Calling Dreams” and “I Shall Return” most clearly demonstrate the theme of the power of dreams to motivate people and bring a sense of purpose to life.

The story “His Motto” by Lottie Burrell Dixon clearly shows how dreams motivate people and bring a sense of purpose. The description of the setting shows Robert Hilton’s worth ethic. The “shelf of books” and the equipment in his shack show this hard work. His shack also has “pictures of aviators and drawings of aeroplanes.” These show how Hilton dreams of big things in his life. The motto from Abraham Lincoln confirms this. Lincoln’s motto says he will “study and make ready and maybe my chance will come.” Hilton does exactly that, and he is rewarded with an opportunity of a lifetime when he successfully sends Durmont’s message. Taken together, these details from the story show how dreams can motivate people to work hard and achieve what they desire.

In her poem “Calling Dreams,” Georgia Douglas Johnson develops the same theme of the power of dreams to motivate people and bring a sense of purpose. The speaker of the poem speaks of her “right to make \[her\] dreams come true” (1). Like in Dixon’s story, dreams are goals that we have to work hard to achieve. Johnson uses figurative language to develop this idea. She writes that she has had her heart “against the ground” (5) where it has “beat the dusty years” (6). In other words, she has been kept down, not achieving her goals. Yet she ends the poem by explaining that she is now standing up. “I rise! I wake!” (7) she writes. Then she strides “into the morning break” (8) with the determination to achieve her dreams. This ending confirms that the poem powerfully shows how dreams and determination can bring meaning and purpose to one’s life.

W.7.1d Maintains a formal tone by beginning sentences with **yet** and **then** instead of **but** and **and**.

W.7.1c Uses phrases like **Just** **like Hughes** . . . to clarify the relationship between ideas.

W.7.9a Draws evidence from literary texts to support analysis.

W.7.1e Provides a conclusion that follows from and supports the argument.

Just like Hughes and Johnson, Claude McKay clearly develops the theme of the power of dreams to motivate people and bring a sense of purpose to life with his poem “I Shall Return.” The poem is about the desire to go back to a homeland. Using figurative language, the author describes the “sapphire skies” (4) and the “dear delicious tunes” (10) of home. The structure of the poem shows this longing. It ends with the statement that he “shall return” (13) to ease his mind of “long, long years of pain” (14). It is clear that home brings peace for the speaker. He says that he wishes to “realize once more \[his\] thousand dreams of waters rushing down the mountain passes.” These images of home are like dreams for him. And it is clear these dreams motivate him. This poem strongly shows the theme of the power of dreams to motivate people and bring a sense of purpose to life.

Dixon, Johnson, and McKay all powerfully develop the theme of the power of dreams to motivate people and bring a sense of purpose to life. The theme is presented differently in each piece, but it shines through strongly in all three works. Dixon shows how one boy’s determination to follow his ambition results in a great opportunity. Johnson explains how dreams give her the determination to reach her goals. McKay uses images of his home to communicate what he longs for, and his promise to return. A curated collection of works in a museum centers around a common theme, and these three works strongly celebrate the power of dreams to motivate us and bring a sense of purpose to life. Dreams helped the artists of the Harlem Renaissance to remember who they are and become who they wanted to be. In dreams, and the determination to follow them, they found the meaning and purpose to live a fulfilled life.
