**Directions:** Exchange your essays with your partner, and follow the Tuning protocol directions (on a separate handout), focusing on giving feedback on the different types of sentences in Proof Paragraph 1. If time allows, you can also give feedback on the types of sentences in Proof Paragraphs 2 and 3. (W.7.5)

**Remember the following definitions:**

| **simple sentence**           | one independent clause                                                              |
| **compound sentence**         | two or more independent clauses; joined by a comma and a conjunction or a semicolon |

| **compound-complex sentence** | two or more independent clauses with one or more dependent clause                   |

**Other Definitions:**

**phrase:** a group of words that modifies or tells more about a noun, verb, or adverb in a sentence

**independent clause:** a group of words with a subject and verb that tells a complete thought

**dependent clause:** a group of words with a subject and verb that doesn’t tell a complete thought; modifies or tells more about the independent clause

**Directions:** Once you have given and received feedback on types of sentences in Proof Paragraph 1, revise your Proof Paragraph to improve sentence variety.

1.  Reread the draft of your essay.

2.  Read the feedback and consider how you can use this feedback to improve your work. You may or may not agree with all the feedback, but you should consider it and incorporate the suggestions that you agree will improve your piece.

3.  Revise your first (and, if applicable, second or third) Proof Paragraph to improve your sentence variety, clearly marking what revisions you have made using a colored pencil.
