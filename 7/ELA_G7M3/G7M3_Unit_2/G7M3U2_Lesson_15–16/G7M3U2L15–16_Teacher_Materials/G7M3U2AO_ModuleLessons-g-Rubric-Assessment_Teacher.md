End of Unit 2 Assessment, Part II: Revise and Edit

Students revise the draft of their argument essays about three texts from the Harlem Renaissance that most develop the theme of the power of dreams to give purpose to life, focusing on their effective use of different types of phrases, clauses, and sentences. Students use a word processor to type a final draft of their essay.

Use the rubric and the changes highlighted on the draft to assess student progress.
