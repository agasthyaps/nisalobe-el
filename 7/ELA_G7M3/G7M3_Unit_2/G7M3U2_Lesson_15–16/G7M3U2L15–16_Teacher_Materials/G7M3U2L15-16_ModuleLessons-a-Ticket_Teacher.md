Today’s lesson involves a Tuning protocol. Which academic mindsets and character traits are required to successfully participate in a Tuning protocol? Text code each one for “PF” (providing feedback) and “RF” (receiving feedback). Some of these may be relevant for both providing and receiving feedback, so text code with both (“PF + RF”). Some may not apply to today’s work, so mark “N/A” for “not applicable”:
