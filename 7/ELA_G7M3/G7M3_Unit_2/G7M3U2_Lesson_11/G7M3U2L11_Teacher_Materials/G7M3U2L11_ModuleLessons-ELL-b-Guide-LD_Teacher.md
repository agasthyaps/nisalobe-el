RI.7.5, W.7.1b, W.7.1c, SL.7.1, L.7.1a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

In his poem “The Negro Speaks of Rivers,” **Langston Hughes develops the same theme of finding strength and hope in the past**. (from Proof Paragraph 2 of the Model Argument Essay: “Strength from the Past”)

**Lesson 11 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after students analyze Proof Paragraph 2 from the Model Argument Essay during Work Time A.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target (**I can write Proof Paragraphs 2 and 3 of my pair argument essay with phrases and clauses that show the relationship between the points, reasons, and evidence**) and W.7.1b and W.7.1c by serving as an example of an effective topic sentence in a Proof Paragraph. This topic sentence supports and reinforces a claim and uses words, phrases, and clauses to connect the sentence to the main claim of the essay. This sentence also helps students address RI.7.5 by providing an opportunity to discuss the sentence’s role in the larger structure of the essay and L.7.1a by featuring multiple phrases and clauses that serve distinct functions in the sentence. Supporting Standards: SL.7.1.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses familiar or repeated words to create cohesion (**same**; **strength and hope**) and it features a prepositional phrase to establish context (**In his poem, “The Negro Speaks of Rivers”**).

- Transfer: a topic sentence that introduces a work to include in a curated exhibit about the Harlem Renaissance and ties the work to the main claim in the pair argument essay.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **In his poem “The Negro Speaks of Rivers,” <u>Langston Hughes develops the same theme of finding strength and hope in the past.</u>**

- Ask:

“What is this sentence about?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“How does this chunk connect to the main claim of the model argument essay?” (The main claim of the model argument essay is that three Harlem Renaissance works best convey themes of strength and hope. This chunk reminds readers what the second work is and prepares readers for the evidence and reasoning that will follow.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **Langston Hughes develops the same theme of finding strength and hope in the past.**

- Ask:

“What is the purpose of the word same in this chunk?” (The purpose of the word same is to remind the reader that the mentioned theme is familiar to them. It’s the theme the reader has seen explored throughout the essay so far.)

“What other words does the writer of this model essay use in this chunk to create cohesion across this and previous paragraphs? Hint: sometimes cohesion is built by repeating words used before.” (The writer again uses the words strength and hope, which are referenced in the main claim. These words remind the reader of the central claim in the essay.)

- If helpful, invite students to revisit their copies of the model argument essay and underline all examples of the words **strength**, **hope**, or **theme**. This exercise will reinforce the idea that keywords are used multiple times throughout the essay to connect ideas.

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **In his poem “The Negro Speaks of Rivers,” <u>Langston Hughes develops the same theme of finding strength and hope in the past</u>.**

- Ask:

“How does the prepositional phrase In his poem, “The Negro Speaks of Rivers,” support your understanding of this sentence?” (The phrase provides context by specifying the focus of Proof Paragraph 2.)

“How does this sentence fit into the larger structure of Proof Paragraph 2?” (It begins the Proof Paragraph. It introduces the second work to include in an exhibit about the Harlem Renaissance.)

“How does this sentence fit into the larger structure of the overall essay?” (This sentence introduces the second of three works to include in a curated exhibit.)

“What do you expect to find after this sentence in Proof Paragraph 2?” (After this sentence, there should be specific evidence or reasoning that supports the idea that Langston Hughes’ poem reflects a theme of strength and hope.)

“Based on this Dive, how do you think Proof Paragraph 3 of the model essay might begin?” (Answers will vary but may include: A third work that shows this theme is . . . ; like Reiss and Hughes, \[author\] develops the theme of finding strength and hope in his work \[“Title”\].)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target:  
I can write Proof Paragraphs 2 and 3 of my pair argument essay with phrases and clauses that show the relationship between the points, reasons, and evidence?” (Responses will vary.)
