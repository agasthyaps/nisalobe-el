Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- L.7.1b – Opening A: On an entrance ticket, students choose among different types of sentences to review and revise the first Proof Paragraph of their pair essay.

- W.7.1c – Work Time A: Students analyze a model Proof Paragraph in an argument essay and add to their understanding of using effective connecting phrases and clauses.

- RL.7.1 – Closing and Assessment A: Students utilize evidence from their reading as they draft their Proof Paragraphs 2 and 3.

- W.7.1c – Closing and Assessment A: Students work in pairs to draft their second and third Proof Paragraphs, focusing on using effective connecting phrases and clauses.

- W.7.1b – Closing and Assessment C: Students support their claims with logical reasoning and relevant evidence as they draft their Proof Paragraphs.

- In this lesson, students focus on becoming effective learners, focusing on collaborating with peers and persevering to write a Proof Paragraph.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- An optional Mini Language Dive, intended for use as students analyze the model Proof Paragraph 2 during Work Time A, is available in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Release students who are ready to read and analyze the model Proof Paragraph 2 independently and move on to drafting Proof Paragraphs 2 and 3 to their practice essay with a partner rather than during modeling.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the second half of this unit, students have been analyzing a model and using their analysis to plan an essay and draft the introduction and Proof Paragraph 1. This lesson continues those routines to guide students in writing Proof Paragraphs 2 and 3.

Support All Students

- In Lessons 8–12, students work with the same partner on a pair argument essay. Provide differentiated mentors by purposefully preselecting student partnerships. Meet with the mentors in advance to encourage them to share their thought process with their partner. ▲

- Students may need additional support while writing their Proof Paragraphs. Group those students for a guided discussion to help them craft effective connecting phrases and clauses. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson includes whole class instruction to understand the use of transitional phrases in Proof Paragraphs. Also, this lesson includes support through collaboration to write a pair essay.

- ELLs may find it challenging to generate language for writing their Proof Paragraphs. In addition to the supports below, encourage students to use oral processing and their home language to assist them in articulating their ideas.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, 7.I.B.6, 7.I.B.7, 7.I.B.8, 7.I.C.11, 7.I.C.12, 7.II.A.1, 7.II.A.2, 7.II.B.3, 7.II.B.4, 7.II.C.6, and 7.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- Use the Grade 7 Writing Process Checklist to assess students’ writing abilities in Closing and Assessment A (see the Tools Page at http://eled.org/tools).

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will write the conclusion, finishing the pair argument essay.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.7.1b (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 11**.

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique for students to share an excellent example of each type of sentence. Inform students that they will continue working with types of sentences for homework but that they can also try to incorporate different types of sentences as they draft the second and third Proof Paragraphs of their pair essay in this lesson.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

- Before students complete Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 11, ask students to Turn and Talk to review each type of sentence, ensuring they remember and understand the nuances between each type.

For Heavier Support

- Before students complete Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 11, Turn and Talk to review each type of sentence, ensuring they remember and understand the nuances between each type.

Work Time

A. Analyze a Model: Transitional Phrases and Clauses – W.7.1c (10 minutes)

- Continue to display the **Model Argument Essay** and invite students to continue to focus on their own copies.

- Using the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol, invite students to stand back to back with a partner. State each question, provide think time, and then ask students to stand face to face to respond. Invite students to find a new partner after each question. Ask the following:

“What is the main claim of this essay?” (The painting *African Phantasy: Awakening* and the poems “The Negro Speaks of Rivers” and “Lift Every Voice and Sing” most clearly demonstrate the theme of finding strength and hope by looking back to the past.)

“What is Point 1?” (*African Phantasy: Awakening* shows the theme.)

“What is Point 2?” (“The Negro Speaks of Rivers” shows the theme.)

“What is Point 3?” (“Lift Every Voice and Sing” shows the theme.)

- Remind students that today, they will write Proof Paragraphs 2 and 3. Read Proof Paragraph 2 of the model aloud as students follow along, reading silently.

- Turn and Talk:

“What are some of the transitional phrases and clauses in this paragraph?” (“In his poem,” “At first,” “Like Reiss’ painting,” “For example”)

“What do you notice about the placement of the transitional phrases and clauses in this paragraph?” (They all come at the beginning of sentences.)

“What is the purpose of the transitional phrases and clauses in the paragraph?” (The transitional phrases and clauses show how one idea connects to another.)

- Use a total participation technique to have students to share out.

- Ensure that students understand that these phrases and clauses show the relationship between the point, evidence, and reasons. Emphasize that the Proof Paragraphs they write, like the model, should have effective phrases and clauses that show how the claim, evidence, and reasoning relate to each other.

- Distribute the **Argument Transition Phrases and Clauses** handout, and review the categories and note any additional connecting words and phrases in the Model Argument Essay.

- If students need more support in identifying connecting phrases and their purposes, draw them into a group and guide them to analyze Proof Paragraph 3 of the Model Argument Essay, using the above questions. ▲

For Lighter Support

- Students can work with their classmates who need heavier support to analyze the use of transitional phrases and clauses. Their classmates can read aloud the transitional phrases. Then students who need lighter support can explain their purpose and note other phrases and clauses from the Argument Transitional Phrases and Clauses handout that they can use in place of the ones in the Model Literary Argument Essay. Explaining a complex concept to a peer ensures that students understand and will remember it.

- After Work Time A, invite students to participate in a **Mini Language Dive** in small groups to explore how a sentence within a Proof Paragraph develops the topic of a model essay with an example. The sentence also helps students to address L.7.1a by providing an opportunity for students to consider the function of a that-clause in a sentence, which builds upon work within the Language Dive in Lessons 6–7.

For Heavier Support

- Students can work with their classmates who need lighter support to analyze the use of transitional phrases and clauses. Students can read aloud the transitional phrases. Then students who need lighter support can explain their purpose and note other phrases and clauses from the Argument Transitional Phrases and Clauses handout that they can use in place of the ones in the Model Literary Argument Essay. Constructing learning with a peer ensures that students understand and remember the complex concept.

Closing and Assessment

A. Pairs: Draft Proof Paragraphs 2 and 3 – W.7.1c (30 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can write Proof Paragraphs 2 and 3 of my pair argument essay with phrases and clauses that show the relationship between the points, reasons, and evidence.”

- Remind students that as they draft the second and third Proof Paragraphs, they should elaborate on the focus of their essay by using logical reasoning to explain how the evidence they have chosen supports their thinking. They should also make sure they include phrases and clauses that show the relationship between the point, reasons, and evidence. Distribute **lined paper**. Invite students to retrieve the following materials:

<!-- -->

- Argument Transition Phrases and Clauses handout

- **Argument Writing checklist**

- **Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer**

- **Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer** ▲

- **Pair Argument Essay**

- The texts and artwork from Units 1 and 2: ***Shuffle Along***, **“Lift Every Voice and Sing,” *The Harp***, **“Calling Dreams,” “Hope,” “I Shall Return,” *Ethiopia Awakening, African Phantasy: Awakening***, **“The Negro Speaks of Rivers,” “His Motto,”** and **“The Boy and the Bayonet”**

<!-- -->

- As necessary, guide students through writing their Proof Paragraph 2:

- Discuss the following characteristics on the Argument Writing checklist, adding to the Characteristics column as needed.

<!-- -->

- **“** W.7.1c: I use words and phrases to show the relationship between my reasons and evidence.”

<!-- -->

- Invite students to read their Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer, their introduction, and their Proof Paragraph 1 from the previous lessons to remind them of their main claim and their points.

- Invite students to refer to the model essay, the **Criteria of an Effective Argument Essay anchor chart**, the Argument Writing checklist, and the **domain-specific** and **academic word walls** to write Proof Paragraph 2.

- Remind students that it is often helpful to orally rehearse the words they will use when they write. Invite students to begin rehearsing and composing Proof Paragraph 2 with their partner. Circulate to support students as they write and to identify common issues to use as whole group teaching points.

- Release students to write Proof Paragraph 3 in their pairs. Circulate, and use the above steps to guide students in their writing.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target and the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- Challenge students to use transitional phrases that differ from those used in the model to ensure they understand and can apply their learning in a new context.

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from the Model Literary Argument Essay. Provide ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Invite students to predict some of the questions that the Language Dive may ask. This will improve students’ metacognition and challenge their awareness of the most interesting or meaningful elements of the sentence.

For Heavier Support

- Encourage students to read aloud the evidence and reasoning from their Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer ▲ for their peers to record in complete sentences in their essay. Also, note for students that they can use the transitional phrases and clauses provided in their Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer ▲ or from the Model Literary Argument Essay in their own writing.

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from the Model Literary Argument Essay. Provide ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Encourage students to independently reflect on this sentence and its meaning before the next lesson. Students may also wish to use dictionaries to add any unknown vocabulary and meanings to their vocabulary logs.

Homework

A. Choose Sentence Types

- Students choose different types of sentences in **Homework: Choose Sentence Types: Proof Paragraphs** to best communicate ideas in the Proof Paragraphs of an essay about the Harlem Renaissance.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
