**Directions:** As you enter class, retrieve your pair argument essay and your Lesson 10 homework. Join with your pair essay partner to review your responses to the homework. Then work with your partner to use the following definitions and text codes (in parentheses) to write in the margins the types of sentences in the first proof paragraph of your pair argument essay.

| Sentence Types                     |                                                                                     |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **simple sentence (S)**            | one independent clause                                                              |
| **compound sentence (C)**          | two or more independent clauses; joined by a comma and a conjunction or a semicolon |
| **complex sentence (CX)**          | one independent clause with one or more dependent clause                            |
| **compound-complex sentence (CC)** | two or more independent clauses with one or more dependent clause                   |

**Other Definitions:**

**phrase:** group of words that modifies or tells more about a noun, verb, or adverb in a sentence

**independent clause:** group of words with a subject and verb that tells a complete thought

**dependent clause:** group of words with a subject and verb that doesn’t tell a complete thought; modifies or tells more about the independent clause

**Directions:** Together with your partner, review your text codes. If you find you don’t have a variety of sentence types, revise some sentences to vary the types. Consider which sentences can be combined or which sentences can be split to make the information more clear. Also, consider whether you want to add phrases to modify or tell more about any nouns or verbs in your sentences.
