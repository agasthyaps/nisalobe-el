**Scene 2 Interactions (Drills, cont.)**

| Part II: How does what happens in the drills affect the characters?                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                       |     |

| When Bud drops the bayonet, he feels **very upset.** The author shows this **with the line “all seemed black before him.”** Hannah and “little sister” also feel **deeply upset.** The author describes how they **were “holding each other’s hands with a despairing grip.”** |                       |                       |     |

**Scene 3 Interactions (Home before Supper)**

| How does each character react to Bud’s mistake in this scene? Support your inference with specific evidence from the text.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                       |                       |

| All three of the characters feel **upset, but they show it in different ways.** “Little sister” reacts by **not being able to see past the horrible incident. “It was so terrible to her,” the author writes, “. . . \[w\]hat to her was the thought of another day”?** Hannah is also upset, but **she knows that “Bud’ll have a chance anotha time.”** Bud reacts by **not coming to supper until his mother makes him.** |                       |                       |
