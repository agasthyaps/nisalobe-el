**Scene 1 Interactions (Plot, Setting, Characters)**

| What big event is coming up? How do the characters feel about this event? How do the characters’ feelings about the event add suspense to the story?                                        |                       |                       |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| The big event that is coming up is the drills. Bud, Hannah, and “little sister” all feel excited for the event. The characters’ excitement means there is suspense building for the drills. |                       |                       |

**Scene 2 Interactions (Drills)**

| How do the beginning of the drills impact Hannah and “little sister”? How does this description add suspense to the story?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                       |                       |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| The drills make Hannah and “little sister” feel **excitement and nervousness.** The author describes them as **“tense and silent.” They experience the event like a “religious ceremonial,” and they watched very intensely as Bud performed his exercises.** This shows how the event makes them feel **both nervous and excited.** This creates **the suspense of the story by describing how it is important to them.** |                       |                       |
