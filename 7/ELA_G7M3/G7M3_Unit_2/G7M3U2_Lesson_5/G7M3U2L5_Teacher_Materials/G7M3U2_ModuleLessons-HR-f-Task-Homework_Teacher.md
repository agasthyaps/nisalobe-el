16. What is a theme in “The Boy and the Bayonet,” and how is it developed? (RL.7.2)

Answers will vary, but may include: A theme in “The Boy and the Bayonet” is that failure is inevitable, and those who love you will support you whether or not you fail. The author develops this theme after Bud drops the bayonet, “Most of them recognized the fact that what had happened to Tom Harris might have happened to any one of them.” This scene shows that failure is inevitable. The theme is developed further through “little sister’s” comment, “We is proud . . . we’s mos’ prouder dan if you’d won.” These lines show that “Little sister” loves and is proud of her brother even though he failed. Through these examples, the author develops the theme that failure is inevitable, but those who love you will support you whether or not you fail.
