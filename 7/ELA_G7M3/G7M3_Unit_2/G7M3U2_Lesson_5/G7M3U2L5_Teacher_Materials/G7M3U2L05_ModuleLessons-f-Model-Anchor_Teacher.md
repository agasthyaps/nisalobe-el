<td><p><strong>“Someone had dropped his bayonet. But with muscles unquivering, without a turned head, the company moved on as if nothing had happened, while one of the judges,<br />
an army officer, stepped into the wake of the boys and picked up the fallen steel.” (Part II)</strong></p>
<p><strong>When the failure occurs, the company moves on as if nothing had happened, and perseveres.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Come on, Buddie,” whispered “little sister,” “Mammy an’ me know you didn’t mean to do it, an’ we don’t keer.” (Part II)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bud threw his arms around his little sister and held her tightly.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“It’s only you an’ ma I care about,” he said, “though I am sorry I spoiled the company’s drill; they say “B” would have won anyway on account of our bad firing, but I did want you and ma to be proud.” (Part II)</strong></p>
<p><strong>“We is proud,” she whispered, “we’s mos’ prouder dan if you’d won,” and pretty soon she led him by the hand to supper. (Part II)</strong></p>
<p><strong>This conversation between Bud and “little sister” shows that Bud’s family is proud of him no matter what, and failure is okay.</strong></p></td>
