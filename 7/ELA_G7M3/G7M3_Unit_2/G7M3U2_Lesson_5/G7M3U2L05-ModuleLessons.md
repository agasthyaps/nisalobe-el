Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- L.7.4 – Opening A: In an opening activity, students are given cards with vocabulary from “The Boy and the Bayonet.” They take turns in pairs reading their vocabulary word and the definition, creating a sentence with the word, and exchanging the cards and finding a new partner.

- RL.7.3 – Work Time A: Students independently read and take notes on “The Boy and the Bayonet,” focusing on elements of the story and how they interact.

- RL.7.6 – Work Time B: Students independently answer questions about “The Boy and the Bayonet” to ensure understanding of how the author develops and contrasts the points of view of different characters in a text.

- RL.7.2– Closing and Assessment A: Students continue to determine and analyze themes in “The Boy and the Bayonet.”

- In this lesson, students focus on becoming effective learners by persevering independently through reading and answering questions, and collaborating and taking initiative with peers during the protocols.

- The Think-Pair-Share protocol is used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- In the excerpt of “The Boy and the Bayonet” read in this lesson, Bud shows courage as he participates in the competition, “little sister” demonstrates empathy, compassion, and growth mindset as she weeps for the mistake her brother made, hugs him, and tells him she’s prouder of him than if he’d won, and Hannah shows empathy and compassion as she tried to cheer up Bud.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release more responsibility more quickly to students as they comprehend the tasks or concepts. For example:

- Allow those students who are identifying the story elements and how they interact to model this work for others before beginning the Card Swap activity.

- During the Card Swap activity, ask students to model sharing answers.

- Allow students to create their own note-catcher, as this is a skill they will need for high school, college, and even in careers. Challenge students to read the learning targets and determine how they would take notes about the interactions between story elements and differing points of view.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students have focused on analyzing how the elements of a story interact and how an author develops and contrasts points of view of different characters in a text. In this lesson, students will try doing this work independently.

Support All Students

- At this point, students should be reading the text independently. However, if some or all students need more support, read a page aloud and release students to read independently, in pairs, or in small groups.

- Some students may require extra support with the text-dependent questions on story elements, connotation, and points of view. During the Back-to-Back, Face-to-Face protocol, pull a small group to review Answer Questions: “The Boy and the Bayonet.”

- The subject matter in this excerpt includes dialogue spoken in a variety of English. Explain to students that this is a strategy writers use to help capture how spoken language sounds in different times and places. Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this chapter that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually. To support students in processing this content, ask: “What habit of character did you use as you read and discussed this story?” Students may need to draw on perseverance, empathy, compassion as they read and discuss this content, being sensitive to their own and others’ reactions to the information presented.

- To support ELLs, this lesson includes a review of the first part of the short story “The Boy and the Bayonet” to help students review key details of the story, interactions between story elements, and how the author develops different characters points of view. This review will set students up for success in reading and analyzing the second part of the story independently.

- ELLs may find it challenging to gradually release from the pair collaboration to independent work. As necessary, encourage students to work independently for half the lesson, grappling with the format they will use on the mid-unit assessment in the following lesson. Then allow students to form homogeneous pairs or small groups to review and correct their responses before the whole class sharing.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, 7.I.B.6, and 7.I.C.10.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ “The Boy and the Bayonet” text-dependent questions to ensure understanding.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will take a mid-unit assessment on “The Boy and the Bayonet,” Part III, for elements, point of view, and language.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.7.4 (5 minutes)

- As students enter class, hand each student a **Card Swap card**. If students enter class at different times, write the directions on the board. If students enter class at the same time, model the activity, explaining that students each meet with a partner. They take turns reading their words and definitions, and creating a sentence using the word. Next, they swap cards with their partner and find a new partner, repeating the process with their partner’s word.

- Ask:

“What are some norms and habits of character we need to keep in mind as we do this activity?” (Staying on task, working quickly, being responsible, showing initiative, and collaborating.)

- As time allows, have students participate in several rounds of the Card Swap activity. As students participate in the activity, record *impulsive*, *volley*, *adherent*, *redeemed*, *oblique*, *consolation*, *disconsolately*, *comrades*, *executed*, *blunderer*, and *relevant* on the **academic word wall** and the **domain-specific word wall** with translations in home languages. Once students complete the activity, invite them to record the words in their **vocabulary logs**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

- During the Opening activity, allow students extra think-time to plan their vocabulary sentences before sharing them with a partner. Some students may even want to write down the sentences to ensure they are correct.

For Heavier Support

- To decrease the cognitive load of the Opening activity, allow students to act out or illustrate on boards their words rather than use them in sentences. Consider providing these options to the whole class to minimize the difference in these students’ responses.

Work Time

A. Read “The Boy and the Bayonet”– RL.7.3 (20 minutes)

- Review appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can explain how the plot shapes the characters in ‘The Boy and the Bayonet.’”

- Inform students that they will independently read “The Boy and the Bayonet,” Part II. Invite students to retrieve their copies of **“The Boy and the Bayonet”** and **Story Elements: “The Boy and the Bayonet,” Part I note-catcher**. Explain that before moving on to Part II, students will first review the work they did on Part I. Ask students to begin by completing a Turn and Talk to review the story elements (setting, characters, and plot) from Part I. For possible responses, see **Story Elements: “The Boy and the Bayonet,” Part I note-catcher (example for teacher reference)**. Ensure that students understand the basic setting, character, and main plot events.

- Invite students to Think-Pair-Share about the different points of view about the chances of Bud’s company “A” winning the drills expressed in Part I of the story. For possible responses, see Story Elements: “The Boy and the Bayonet,” Part I note-catcher (example for teacher reference). Ensure students understand that Bud thinks hard work will win the competition; Hannah thinks they’ll win, but hides that with comments about not being too confident; and “little sister” is very excited.

- Distribute **Story Elements: “The Boy and the Bayonet,” Part II note-catcher**. Briefly, review the note-catcher, explaining what students will need to record in each section. Ask students to independently read the second part of “The Boy and the Bayonet,” annotating and text coding, paying particular attention to how story elements interact. If needed, remind students that although they read Part II of the story for homework, it is important to read complex texts several times to comprehend and analyze them.

- Explain that once they have finished reading, students should answer the questions and fill in notes for the second part of the story, completing their Story Elements: “The Boy and the Bayonet,” Part II note-catcher. As students read, circulate and support them as needed, ensuring they remain on task and are annotating and taking notes on the story elements.

- Once students have finished reading and filling out the note-catcher, use a total participation technique to review students’ notes in the note-catcher. As necessary, record student responses on a displayed copy of the note-catcher for students who need more visual support. For possible responses, see **Story Elements: “The Boy and the Bayonet,” Part II note-catcher (example for teacher reference)**.

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What habits of character did you see in this excerpt? Who demonstrated them? What did they look or sound like?” (Possible response: Bud shows courage as he participates in the competition. “Little sister” demonstrates empathy, compassion, and growth mindset as she weeps for the mistake her brother made, hugs him, and tells him she’s prouder of him than if he’d won. Hannah shows empathy and compassion as she tries to cheer up Bud.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time A, if time allows, encourage students to work in small groups to create a comic strip or graphic panel version of the second part of the story. Challenge students to include dialogue and descriptions in the panels. If necessary, display a graphic novel panel for students to understand the form. Illustrating the scenes of the story will reinforce their comprehension of the characters, setting, and plot events.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time A, if time allows, encourage students to work in small groups to create a comic strip or graphic panel version of the second part of the story. If necessary, display a graphic novel panel for students to understand the form. Illustrating the scenes of the story will engage students and increase their comprehension of the characters, setting, and plot events.

- Also in Work Time A, encourage students to use the Story Elements: “The Boy and the Bayonet,” Part II note-catcher ▲. This resource includes sentence frames that support students in comprehension and writing about the interactions of story elements and how the author develops points of view.

Work Time

B. Analyze “The Boy and the Bayonet” – RL.7.6 (15 minutes)

- Review appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can explain how the plot shapes the characters in ‘The Boy and the Bayonet.’”

“I can identify the points of view of Bud, Hannah, and ‘little sister’ in ‘The Boy and the Bayonet.’”

“I can explain how an author develops and contrasts the points of view of Bud, Hannah, and ‘little sister’ in ‘The Boy and the Bayonet.’”

- Remind students that they have answered text-dependent questions about story elements and points of view in homework for Lessons 2–4. They will now answer similar questions about the second part of “The Boy and the Bayonet.” Remind students to draw on their notes in Story Elements: “The Boy and the Bayonet,” Part II note-catcher. Also, note that they will answer similar questions on their mid-unit assessment in the following lesson.

- Distribute the **Answer Questions: “The Boy and the Bayonet,” Part II** and **red** and **blue** **highlighters** or **colored pencils**. Read aloud the directions and ensure students understand the task. As necessary, review the **Strategies to Answer Selected Response Questions anchor chart**. Ensure students understand how to use the colored pencils or highlighters on item 2. Ask students to work independently to answer the questions.

- Once students have finished responding to all the questions, ask students to share their responses with a partner to ensure engagement and comprehension. Use a total participation technique to review student responses.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Closing and Assessment

A. Explore Themes: “The Boy and the Bayonet” – RL.7.2 (5 minutes)

- Display and draw students’ attention to the **Harlem Renaissance Themes** **anchor chart**. Ask students to Think-Pair-Share about a theme they see emerging in this section of text:

“What do you think the text is mostly about at this point?” (Possible response: The character Bud drops his bayonet during the competition.)

“What theme could be emerging or beginning to develop at this point in the text?” (Possible response: A possible theme of the text is that failing is an important part of learning.)

“What questions do you have about what is happening and what is to come in the text?” (Possible response: I am curious to see what will happen when Bud returns to school.)

- Add student responses for possible themes to the anchor chart. Tell students that they will revisit these emerging themes once they are done reading the story to see if they would like to classify them as themes of the story and to see what evidence there is to support these themes.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Answer Questions and QuickWrite about “The Boy and the Bayonet,” Part II

- Students complete **Homework: Answer Questions and QuickWrite: “The Boy and the Bayonet,” Part II** answer questions to analyze story elements and points of view in the second part of the story. Finally, they do a Quickwrite on how theme is developed.

For Lighter Support

- Before students leave class, ask them to read the homework assignments and discuss them with a partner. Encourage students to spend time find and share evidence to write about a theme of the story. Doing so will prepare them to write with strong evidence as well as give them opportunities to engage speaking and listening skills practice.

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from “The Boy and the Bayonet.” Provide ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Ask students to consider how the language in this sentence differs from the language they use in academic reading, speaking, and writing. Invite students to predict some of the questions that the Language Dive may ask. This will improve students’ metacognition and challenge their awareness of the most interesting or meaningful elements of the sentence.

For Heavier Support

- Before students leave class, review the homework assignments and ensure that students understand that they will answer questions and QuickWrite a paragraph about the short story “The Boy and the Bayonet.” Encourage students to use the Answer Questions and QuickWrite: “The Boy and the Bayonet,” Part II ▲. This resource includes sentence frames which support students in comprehension and writing about the theme of the story.

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from “The Boy and the Bayonet.” Provide ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Explain to students that this sentence is written in a local variety of English, not the academic English students use in speaking and writing in class. Encourage students to independently reflect on this sentence and its meaning before the next lesson. Students may also wish to use dictionaries to add any unknown vocabulary and meanings to their vocabulary logs.
