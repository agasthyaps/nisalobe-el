Close Reading Guide:  
“The Boy and the Bayonet”

RL.7.3, RL.7.6

(For Teacher Reference)

**Purpose and Notes**

- The purpose of this close read is for students to trace the way the author introduces the setting, characters, and plot and how they interact in the text. It also establishes contrasting points of view of characters about the same situation.

- In this close read, students will focus only on the selected sections of the text, which are related to how the setting, characters, and plot interact.

- For the sake of time, first, read aloud the text.

- Next, students reread portions as they answer text-dependent questions.

- A note-catcher along with text-dependent questions provides an opportunity for students to determine how the author introduces the story elements and establishes contrasting points of view of characters about the same situation.

- Continue to use discussion protocols (e.g., Think-Pair-Share, Conversation Cues, and total  
  participation techniques) to engage all students in collaborative discussion about the text.

<li><p>Before reading the first part of “The Boy and the Bayonet” aloud, inform students that the story takes place in Washington near the end of the school year. Although no date is given, we can assume it is around 1900, as the story was published in 1904. Invite students to add this information to the “Setting” box at the top of their Story Elements: “The Boy and the Bayonet,” Part I note-catchers.</p></li>
<li><p>Explain that the main event described is a military drill exercise performed by the boys in the local schools, which was a highly anticipated event at this time and place. The military drills are performed by different “companies,” or groups of boys, who must demonstrate skill in marching and handling weapons, while working together and moving in rhythm with their teammates. Also note that some of the dialogue is written in a variety of English that is different from the variety of English used in the narrative portions of the text. This dialogue helps readers envision the setting and the characters. Students should do their best to pronounce the words as written without mocking them.</p></li>

<td>Reread from “It was June, and nearing the closing time of school” to “work which followed hard upon its heels.”</td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Inform students that today they will be analyzing the story in scenes as they did for the story “His Motto.”</p></li>
<li><p>Clarify for students that Tom and “Bud” both refer to the same character. Bud is his nickname. He is referred to most of the time as Bud, so that is the name students should use most often to discuss the character.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask students, “Who are the three characters introduced in this section? How are they related to each other? What are their attitudes about the upcoming drills?” (The three characters are Hannah Davis, Tom (Bud) Davis, and “little sister.” Hannah Davis is the mother of Tom and “little sister,” who are brother and sister. Hannah and her son are both proud of him for participating in the upcoming drills.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask students to Turn and Talk in triads about how the third paragraph in the story helps to develop the character of the “little sister.” (It shows that she can’t go to school and is forced to stare at the houses on her street. She lacks excitement in her life, which is part of the reason she is so excited for Bud’s drills.)</p></li>
<li><p>Invite students to note the characters’ names and descriptions in the appropriate boxes of the “Characters” section of their Story Elements: “The Boy and the Bayonet,” Part I note-catcher.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask students, “What event is coming up? What roles will the characters play in this event?” (The event coming up is the drills. Bud will participate in them and Hannah and “little sister” will watch him perform.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask students to reread this sentence: “Drills especially, for nothing so gladdens the heart of the Washington mother, be she black or white, as seeing her boy in the blue cadet’s uniform, marching proudly to the huzzas of an admiring crowd.” Then ask students to Turn and Talk: “What does this description tell us about the setting and the importance of the upcoming event for the characters? How do the characters’ feelings about the event add suspense to the story?” (It shows that the event was extremely important not only to Bud’s mother, but to every mother in Washington. This adds suspense because the reader sees how important the event is and anticipates it more.)</p></li>
<li><p>Invite students to add their notes about the interactions between Characters, Setting, and Plot in this first scene in the kitchen to the box labeled “Scene 1 Interactions” on their Story Elements: “The Boy and the Bayonet,” Part I note-catcher.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask students to work in their triads to add any remaining notes they’ve gathered so far to the “Settings,” “Character,” and “Scene 1 Interactions” boxes on their Story Elements: “The Boy and the Bayonet,” Part I note-catcher.</p></li>

<td><ul>
<li><p>Tell students that they will now look more closely at how the author develops the characters’ points of view about the upcoming drills in this section.</p></li>
<li><p>Draw students’ attention to the “Zoom-in on Point of View” box on their Story Elements: “The Boy and the Bayonet,” Part I note-catcher. Guide students through gathering notes about how the author develops points of view in this section by inviting students to Turn and Talk with their triads about the following questions:</p></li>
<li><p>“What does Bud tell the family? Why does the author say this is ‘not boasting’?” (Bud tells the family about what his company is doing and “what they were going to do to companies ‘B’ and ‘C.’” The author says it is not “boasting” but instead an “expression of a confidence” that comes from all the hard work.)</p></li>
<li><p>“How does the reply of ‘little sister’ to Bud develop her point of view about the upcoming drills contest?” (It shows that she is very confident and believes that Bud’s team will win.)</p></li>
<li><p>“How does Bud’s reply to Hannah develop his point of view about the drills contest?” (It shows that he is confident, but knows his company must work hard.)</p></li>
<li><p>“How does the description of Hannah as well as her dialogue develop her point of view about the upcoming drills contest?” (She is described as adding an “admonitory check to her own confidence,” and she reminds Bud that there “ain’t been no man” who was so good that there wasn’t someone better.) Ask students to grapple with the phrase <strong>admonitory check</strong>, using context to try to define it. As necessary, provide the following definition of <strong>admonitory</strong> (expressing a minor warning or correction). Ask students to record this word in their vocabulary logs.</p></li>
<li><p>Pause to allow students to add the evidence they gathered about the characters’ points of view to the “Zoom in on Point of View: Scene 1” section of their note-catchers.</p></li>

<li><p>Tell students that they will now focus on the first half of Scene 2, the beginning of the drills. After answering the questions below as a class, students will have an opportunity to fill out the “Scene 2 Interactions” box on their note-catchers.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask students, “How do the descriptions in the first paragraph of this excerpt distinguish Hannah and ‘little sister’ from the rest of the crowd?” (The author says that they were “tense and silent” while there was movement all around them. They did not laugh or shout, but treated the event like a “religious ceremonial.”)</p></li>
<li><p>Explain to students that the references to “Old Judea,” “trumpet,” and “prophet,” are references to the Bible. Ask students, “How does comparing the drills to ‘a religious ceremonial’ help develop the context of the event?” (By comparing it to a religious ceremonial, the author develops how important it was for Hannah and “little sister.”)</p></li>
<li><p>“How do the descriptions of Hanna and ‘little sister’ add to the suspense of the story?” (By explaining how “tense” they are, the author helps to increase suspense about the event.)</p></li>
<li><p>“What are some of the key words and phrases the author uses to describe the movements of the boys in the drills? How does this figurative language help describe the event?” (Some of the key words and phrases are <strong>brisk, straight, soldierly</strong>, <strong>moved like clockwork</strong>, and <strong>bound together by inflexible iron bars</strong>. These words and phrases all help to develop how the boys moved together as one unit. This paints a picture of what they looked like during the drills.)</p></li>
<li><p>Invite students to work together in their groups to answer the questions in the “Scene 2 Interactions” on their Story Elements: “The Boy and the Bayonet,” Part I note-catcher.</p></li>
