**Scene 3 Interactions (Shack)**

| What is the setting in this final scene? How does the description of the setting develop the character of Hilton?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                       |                       |     |

| The setting is **the room where Hilton has set up his wireless telegraph. It is described as a “one-room shack” which has the wireless, a “shelf of books,” and pictures of airplanes as well as a model airplane.** The description of the setting shows that **even though Hilton doesn’t have a lot of resources in his “one-room shack,” he is very curious and creative.**                            |                       |                       |     |
| How are the relationships between the characters described? How do these relationships influence the plot of the story?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                       |                       |     |
| Hilton has offered to help **Durmont send an important message, using his wireless telegraph.** Durmont is doubtful Hilton can help because **he is prejudiced against him. Durmont’s doubts about Hilton make the reader wonder what will happen.** When Hilton sends the message, **it is a triumph for the character.** Hilton’s success highlights **how wrong and harmful Durmont’s prejudices are.** |                       |                       |     |

<td colspan="4">A theme of the story is that <strong>prejudice prevents people from recognizing others’ humanity and worth.</strong> The author develops this theme by <strong>introducing the character of Hilton, who has the ability to operate a wireless telegraph to send messages. Because of his prejudice, the businessman, Durmont, doubts that Hilton can use the telegraph. Only when Durmont can see himself in Hilton does he begin to see beyond his own prejudice and offer him a chance in his business.</strong> This shows how <strong>prejudice prevents people from recognizing others’ humanity and worth.</strong></td>
