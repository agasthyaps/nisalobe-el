Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- L.7.4 – Opening A: On an entrance ticket, students share the previous lesson’s homework: the definitions they generated using strategies to determine the meaning of unknown vocabulary from “His Motto.”

- RL.7.3 – Work Time A: Students read and analyze the second half of “His Motto” to determine the elements of the story and how they interact.

- RL.7.6 – Work Time A: Students read and analyze the second half of “His Motto” to determine different characters points of view and how they compare and develop.

- RL.7.2 – Closing and Assessment A: Students work as a class to determine themes in “His Motto” and analyze their development over the course of the text.

- In this lesson, students focus on becoming effective learners by collaborating to answer questions about the text.

- The Think-Pair-Share protocol is used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- In the excerpt of “His Motto” read in this lesson, Robert Hilton shows perseverance in the face of Durmont’s prejudice as he continues to believe in his own ability. He also demonstrates initiative and pride in his work as he sends the message successfully.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- An optional Mini Language Dive, intended for use after students read and analyze “His Motto” during Work Time A, is available in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Release more responsibility more quickly to students as they comprehend the tasks or concepts. For example:

- Allow students to create their own note-catcher, as this is a skill they will need for high school, college, and even in careers. Challenge students to read the learning targets and determine how they would take notes about the interactions between story elements and differing points of view.

- Allow students who are more readily identifying the elements of the story and understanding different points of view the opportunity to develop their own text-dependent questions. Ask these students to share their questions with the group to generate discussion. Being able to ask and answer one’s own questions about a text is another skill students will need for high school, college, and careers.

- Allow students, if they prefer, to access the text-dependent questions while they’re reading.

- Invite students to participate in collaborative discussions regarding the text so they can grow their thinking.

- Invite students to do a think-aloud explaining how they arrived at a given answer to a text-dependent question.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students began analyzing short stories, identifying the elements of the story and how points of view are introduced and developed in the text. In this lesson, students continue their work analyzing the stories, with a particular focus on how the author contrasts and develops the points of view of different characters in a text.

Support All Students

- The subject matter in this excerpt includes descriptions of racism. Continue to monitor students to determine if issues surface from the content of this story that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually. To support students in processing this content, ask: “What habit of character did you use as you read and discussed this story?” Students may need to draw on perseverance, empathy, and compassion as they read and discuss this content, being sensitive to their own and others’ reactions to the information presented.

- Students may need additional support to understand the historical context of the story. Use visual aids to explain how telegraphs worked. ▲

- Note that there is a differentiated version of the Story Elements: “His Motto,” Part II note-catcher used in Work Time A in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson includes a teacher-led discussion and pair collaboration to guide students to read the second half of “His Motto” and analyze the interaction of story elements and the development of points of view.

- ELLs may find it challenging to gradually release from the class close read analysis to pair collaboration. Form strategic pairs, triads, or small groups to support students who may need more guidance analyzing the story.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, 7.I.B.6, and 7.I.C.10.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ “His Motto” Story Elements note-catchers and Questions about “His Motto,” Part II handouts to ensure understanding.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will apply their learning about how authors construct a story and develop points of view to analyze another short story from the Harlem Renaissance, “The Boy and the Bayonet” by Paul Laurence Dunbar.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.7.4 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 3**.

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique to review their responses. Add any words students shared to the **academic** and **domain-specific word walls** with translations in home languages where appropriate, and invite students to add words to their **vocabulary logs**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

- Encourage students to extend their vocabulary learning by using the words in sentences and then sharing their words and sentences with a partner. Doing so will not only ensure that students have another chance to reinforce the vocabulary they identified while reading but also to learn new vocabulary from their peers.

For Heavier Support

- Encourage students to extend their vocabulary learning by illustrating the words if possible and then sharing their words and illustrations with a partner. Doing so will not only ensure that students have another chance to reinforce the vocabulary they identified while reading but also to learn new vocabulary from their peers.

Work Time

A. Read and Analyze “His Motto” – RL.7.3, RL.7.6 (35 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can explain how the setting shapes the characters and plot in ‘His Motto.’”

- Inform students that they will finish reading the story “His Motto” and analyze how the characters, setting, and plot interact, as well as finish their descriptions of how the points of view of the characters are developed and contrasted in the story. Explain to students that although they read the story for homework, complex texts must be read several times to comprehend and analyze them.

- Invite students to retrieve their copies of **“His Motto.”** Distribute copies of the **Story Elements: “His Motto,” Part II note-catcher** and **Story Elements: “His Motto,” Part II note-catcher** ▲. The differentiated note-catcher supports students’ writing and comprehension with sentence frames. ▲ Explain to students that they will use this note-catcher to analyze the second half of the story. As necessary, review what students will record in each box and explain how this note-catcher is similar to the note-catcher from the previous lesson.

- Ask for student volunteers to take turns reading the whole story as the class follows along.

- After the story has been read, and before moving on to analysis of the elements of the story, allow students to reflect on their reactions to the racial dynamics in the story. Students may want to react to or learn more about how and why the story depicts the white businessman deciding to provide an opportunity for the young black American boy after initially holding racist views of him, and how the black American boy is portrayed as being delighted to have this opportunity, even though he was likely aware of what the white businessman initially thought of him. Students should understand that while this story dramatizes the social dynamics between two people, it does not provide the context that explains how those dynamics came to be: that is, the historical factors that led to a white businessman having so much wealth and power, as well as his feeling empowered to decide whom to offer opportunities or support to and when to do it. Allow students to voice their discomfort or questions about the circumstances that make this scenario possible. Encourage them to challenge portrayals of Durmont’s character development by grappling with critical questions like, “Where does Durmont’s racism come from? What in his environment reinforces those attitudes? How does Hilton challenge Durmont’s prejudices? If Hilton had not built his own telegraph machine, would Hilton’s point of view toward Durmont have changed by the end of the story? What does this suggest about the depth or sincerity of Durmont’s development?” An optional Mini Language Dive addresses these questions directly, supporting students as they navigate these complex issues.

- Invite students to Turn and Talk with a partner about the following questions. After each question, ask for student volunteers to share out responses and add to their “His Motto” story Elements note-catchers in the “Scene Three Interactions” box. See **Story Elements: “His Motto,” Part II note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** for guidance. Circulate and support students as they fill out their note-catchers to confirm understanding of the different aspects of the story.

“What is the setting of this final scene in the story? How is it described?” (The setting is the room where Hilton has set up his wireless telegraph. It is described as a “one-room shack” which has the wireless, a “shelf of books,” and pictures of airplanes as well as a model airplane.)

“How does the description of this setting help develop the character of Hilton?” (The description of the setting shows that even though Hilton doesn’t have a lot of resources in his “one-room shack,” he is very curious and creative. He keeps many books and pictures of airplanes and aviators as well as a model airplane.)

“Who are the characters in the scene? What is their relationship to each other?” (The characters are Durmont and Hilton. They have just met, and Hilton has offered to help Durmont send an important message, using his wireless telegraph. Durmont is doubtful that Hilton can help because he is prejudiced against him.)

“How does the relationship between the characters influence what happens in the story’s plot?” (Durmont’s doubts about Hilton makes the reader wonder what will happen. When Hilton sends the message, it is a triumph for the character and helps to highlight that Durmont’s prejudices are wrong and harmful.)

- Direct students’ attention to the Point of View box on their “His Motto” Story Elements note-catchers. Ask students to recall the points of view at the beginning of the story about Hilton’s ability to help Durmont. Ask students to Think-Pair-Share about the following questions about those points of view and how they change over the course of the text. As students share, encourage them to add to their “His Motto” Story Elements note-catchers. See “His Motto,” Part II Story Elements note-catcher (example for teacher reference) for guidance.

“What were Durmont and Hilton’s points of view about Hilton’s ability to help Durmont earlier in the story? How did they change by the end of the story? What is an event or description that shows Durmont reconsidering his point of view?” (Durmont was skeptical that Hilton would be able to help and expressed and demonstrated prejudice toward him. Hilton was confident that his wireless would work, however. Durmont’s point of view changes as he sees Hilton working and considers himself in that position. When Durmont reads the motto on the wall, he “looked at the boy as if seeing him for the first time.” Hilton’s point of view about his own ability remained the same, as he seemed to always be confident in his own work.)

“Imagine that Hilton had never built a telegraph machine and thus could not transmit Durmont’s wireless message. Do you think that Durmont’s point of view toward Hilton would still have changed by the end of the story?” (If Hilton could not have helped Durmont by transmitting his wireless message, Durmont’s point of view toward Hilton would likely not have changed. He would have maintained his earlier prejudices and dismissed Hilton based on the color of his skin. This suggests that Durmont’s prejudices remain until someone has something to offer him.)

“Reread this line from the end of the story: ‘To find himself threatened with a large financial loss; to have this averted by the help of the scientific knowledge of a colored boy, and that boy rating the fact of his success higher than any pecuniary compensation—he had to pull himself together a bit.’ What three shocks does Durmont endure in this story?” (His business is threatened; it is saved by a black boy; the black boy regards success as more important than money.)

“What do these lines show about how hard it is for Durmont to change his misconceptions? What does this imply about the depth and strength of his prejudice?” (Durmont cannot believe that a black boy can help him and can value success above money. This is as shocking to him as a crisis in his business. These lines show how deep and damaging Durmont’s prejudice is.)

- If students don’t suggest it, point out that when Durmont reconsiders Hilton, it is a turning point in the story. Ask volunteers to define a turning point. (It is a moment when an important change takes place.)

“What is the meaning of the ‘motto’ that Durmont sees on Hilton’s wall? How does the motto influence Durmont’s point of view of Hilton as well as the plot?” (The motto is from Abraham Lincoln, and it means that if you work hard and prepare, you will be rewarded when opportunity comes. Durmont sees the motto and is reminded of himself when he was young and working hard to achieve his dreams. It helps him understand that Hilton had it much harder than he did, as he had limited resources and had to face prejudice because of his race. It also helps convince Durmont to offer Hilton an opportunity to work with him.)

“Do you think Durmont’s character has truly changed? Use evidence from the text to support your opinion.” (Either response is appropriate: Yes, his character has changed, because he sees Hilton in a new light, is shamed by his own prejudice, and offers Hilton a job. No, his character has not changed. He maintains his power as a wealthy white man who can give or take away opportunity from Hilton as he pleases.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time A, after reading the story aloud, allow time for students to Turn and Talk to share their notes from the previous lesson’s homework.

- Also in Work Time A, if time allows, encourage students to form groups of five to act out the dialogues between Durmont and Robert Hilton. Students who need lighter support can take the roles of Robert Hilton and the narrator-reading the lines around the dialogue. Acting out the story will engage students and reinforce their comprehension of the characters, setting, and plot events.

- After students read and analyze “His Motto” in Work Time A, invite students to participate in a Mini Language Dive in small groups to examine a character’s developing point of view toward another character (RL.7.6). This Mini Language Dive also helps students address L.7.4 by including a potentially unknown word (*inclination*), which students can use vocabulary strategies to interpret.

- At the end of Work Time A, as time allows, remind students of the work they did in the Language Dive in Module 3, Unit 1, Lesson 7, especially their work with present perfect verb tense. Ask volunteers to explain to the group how to form the present perfect tense (have/has + past participle). Ask students to share examples. Then ask students to work with a partner to identify the verb tenses in the paragraph that begins “Well, I’m interested in all kinds of electrical experiments, and have kept up reading . . . ” Have volunteers share their identifications and confirm or correct them. Ask what the present perfect verb suggests about Hilton in the first line. (He has continued to study.)

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time A, after reading the story aloud, allow time for students to Turn and Talk to share their highlights and sketches from the previous lesson’s homework.

- Also in Work Time A, if time allows, encourage students to form groups of five to act out the dialogues between Durmont and Robert Hilton. Students who need heavier support can take the role of Durmont. Acting out the story will engage students and increase their comprehension of the characters, setting, and plot events.

- Also in Work Time A, encourage students to use the Story Elements: “His Motto,” Part II note-catcher ▲. This resource includes sentence frames that support students in comprehension and writing about the interactions of story elements and how the author develops points of view.

Closing and Assessment

A. Analyze Themes: “His Motto” – RL.7.2 (5 minutes)

- Display and draw students’ attention to the **Harlem Renaissance Themes anchor chart**. Ask students to Think-Pair-Share with a partner about what themes they’ve identified in the story as well as how the author is developing these themes. As students share out their responses, add the themes and the ways the author develops them to the Harlem Renaissance Themes anchor chart.

- To support students in analyzing theme, ask them to Think-Pair-Share:

“What is the author’s message about race and power relations? Why might a black author write this story?” (The author may have wanted to depict an all-too-familiar relationship between white people with power and black people without power at this time. The author is showing that black people were expected to prove their worth rather than being treated as worthy simply because they’re human beings.)

- See the **Harlem Renaissance Themes anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** for guidance.

- Ask:

“What habits of character did you see in this excerpt? Who demonstrated them? What did they look/sound like?” (Possible response: Hilton demonstrates perseverance in the face of Durmont’s prejudice and doubt as he successfully works to transmit Durmont’s message.)

- Before leaving class, ensure that students have copies of **“The Boy and the Bayonet”** for homework. Ask students to read the title and the first two paragraphs in class. Ask students to Turn and Talk to describe the type of school Bud or Tom (same person) attends. (a military school)

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- Allow students extra think-time to identify a theme in the story. As necessary, prompt with questions such as:

- What does the story tell us about prejudice or achieving dreams?

For Heavier Support

- Provide students with a sentence frame to share their thoughts about theme, so that they have the language structures for comprehension and to participate fully in the discussion:

- The author’s message is that prejudice / achieving dreams is \_\_\_\_.

Homework

A. Analyze Theme

- Students complete their Story Elements: “His Motto,” Part II note-catcher by writing a paragraph to identify a theme in the story and find evidence that supports that theme.

B. Answer Questions about “His Motto,” Part II

- Students complete **Homework: Answer Questions: “His Motto,” Part II** to analyze points of view and story elements.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- Before students leave class, review the homework assignments and remind students to use the Story Elements: “His Motto,” Part II note-catcher ▲, which supports students in writing about theme.

C. Preread “The Boy and the Bayonet,” Part I

- Students preread Part I of “The Boy and the Bayonet” and look up unfamiliar vocabulary in preparation for studying the beginning of the story in the next lesson.

For Lighter Support

- Before students leave class, ask them to read the homework assignments and discuss them with a partner. Encourage students to spend time brainstorming vocabulary and language structures to write about the theme of the story. Challenge students to include at least one example of the present perfect verb (has/have + past participle; for example, the author has shown) in their writing.

- Also, remind students to take notes in the margins as they read the first part of the story “The Boy and the Bayonet.” Doing so will ensure comprehension and retention of important details.

For Heavier Support

- Also for homework, students will preread the first part of the short story “The Boy and the Bayonet.” Read aloud the title and display or sketch a picture of a bayonet. Then read aloud the first two paragraphs and use sketches to explain that the main character, called Bud or Tom, attends a military school.

- Finally, remind students to highlight key words or phrases and to illustrate and take notes in the margins as they read. Direct students to circle all unknown vocabulary words but only look up those important for understanding the story.
