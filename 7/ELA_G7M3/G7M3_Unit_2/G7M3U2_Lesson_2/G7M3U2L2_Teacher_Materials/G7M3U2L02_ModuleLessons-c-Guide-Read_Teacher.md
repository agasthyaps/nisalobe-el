Close Reading Guide: “His Motto,” Part I

RL.7.3, RL.7.6

(For Teacher Reference)

**Purpose and Notes**

- The purpose of this close read is for students to trace the way the author introduces the setting, characters, and plot and how they interact in the text. It also establishes contrasting points of view of characters about the same situation.

- In this close read, students will focus only on the selected sections of the text, which are related to how the setting, characters, and plot interact in the text.

- For the sake of time, first, read aloud the text.

- After the text is read aloud, students reread portions of the text as they answer text-dependent questions.

- A note-catcher along with text-dependent questions provide an opportunity for students to analyze how the author introduces the story elements and establishes contrasting points of view of characters about the same situation.

- Continue to use discussion protocols (e.g., Think-Pair-Share, Conversation Cues, and total participation techniques) to engage all students in collaborative discussion about the text.

<li><p>Before reading the first half of “His Motto” aloud for students, read and discuss the editorial note at the beginning of the story. Allow time for students to explain or ask questions about the telegraph and the setting of Maine.</p></li>
<li><p>Explain that although the story starts in New York, they can focus on the primary setting of Maine for their note-catchers. Invite students to add “Early 1900s Maine” to the setting box of their Story Elements: “His Motto,” Part I note-catcher.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide students with the following vocabulary: <strong>prognostications</strong> (predictions based on current signs or symptoms) <strong>Amalgamated Copper</strong> (a large mining company from this time). Encourage students to add <strong>prognostications</strong> to their vocabulary logs.</p></li>
<li><p>Read aloud the first half of “His Motto” as students read along silently. Invite students to Turn and Talk in a triad, and then cold-call students to share out: “What is this story about so far?” (A businessman is on a fishing trip and receives an important message on the telegraph. He wants to make a reply, but the telegraph line is down. There is a boy who can help him send his message with a wireless telegraph, but the businessman is prejudiced against him because the boy is black. He agrees to go with the boy anyway.)</p></li>
<li><p>Confirm for students that they will be reading a story where one of the main characters acts in a prejudiced way toward another. In this excerpt, Durmont will show “unconcealed prejudice” toward Hilton because of his race, while Hilton remains polite and helpful. Watching this dynamic unfold may cause painful feelings and raise questions for students. Give voice to these students’ concerns by encouraging them to speak about how this power dynamic has played out through history and how students continue to witness and experience prejudice today. As students continue to read and finish the story in the next lesson, provide an understanding of the historical context of the story, while confirming for them that Durmont’s actions near the end of the story should not be seen as negating the harm of his own racism or the prejudices that continue to exist today. Explain that now you will examine the story by looking closely at the different scenes in the text to better understand how the author introduces the setting, characters, and plot and how all the elements work together to make the story itself. Finally, focus on one scene to examine how the author develops and contrasts points of view.</p></li>

<li><p>Explain to students that they are going to analyze this first scene together to understand who is talking, what the characters are doing, and what they are like. Tell them that although the author doesn’t say who is speaking in the dialogue, they will be able to figure it out from context clues.</p></li>
<li><p>Tell students that a <strong>specialist</strong>, one of the characters described in the second paragraph, is a kind of doctor. Ask students to Turn and Talk in triads to answer the question: “What does the author say the specialist has ‘tricked’ John Durmont into doing?” (The author says Durmont has been tricked into a “confession of physical bankruptcy.”)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask if students are familiar with the word <strong>bankruptcy</strong>. Confirm the definition that bankruptcy means not having enough money to pay one’s debts. Ask a student volunteer: “What does it mean that Durmont has made a ‘confession of physical bankruptcy’?” (He is saying that he is physically broken or exhausted, out of energy.) Explain the phrase “my prognostications as to your ultimate destination,” as meaning, the doctor’s predictions about how the stress of Durmont’s current life will lead to his death. Ask students: “What is the doctor’s suggestion for Durmont to deal with his ‘physical bankruptcy’?” (The doctor suggests that he go on a fishing trip to Maine.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask students: “Given these clues, who is speaking in the first line of the story? What can we guess about his profession?” (John Durmont is speaking. He is a businessman of some kind, as he says he “can’t leave” his “business affairs” to go on a trip.) Point out to students how the dialogue in the first section alternates between Durmont and the doctor.</p></li>
<li><p>Direct students’ attention to the Story Elements: “His Motto,” Part I note-<br />
catcher. Tell students that they will fill out the relevant sections in this note-<br />
catcher today. Ask students to label one of the character boxes “John Durmont” and another “Durmont’s Doctor.” Ask students to add what they<br />
know so far about Durmont and the doctor to this section of the note-catcher.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask students to Turn and Talk about the questions: “Where does Durmont end up at the end of this section? How does he feel about it?” (He ends up “deep in the Maine woods.” He is surprised that he “found he liked it.”) Point out to students how the description of the new setting suggests that it will play an important role in the story.</p></li>
<li><p>Invite students to Turn and Talk about the questions in the “Scene 1 Interactions” box on their note-catchers, and add their answers to this box.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask students: “How does the detail that Durmont wanted to be ‘within reach of a telegraph wire’ develop his character?” (It shows that he seems to be a very committed businessman. Even though he was going away, he still wanted to be able to receive messages.)</p></li>

<td><ul>
<li><p>Confirm for students that for this section they will analyze the interactions between characters, setting, and plot for Scene 2, which takes place near the hotel and inside the telegraph room.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask students to draw on the background knowledge discussed at the beginning of the close-read in order to paraphrase the sentence “he met the youthful operator from the near-by station looking for him with a message.” Ask: “What is happening here? Who is the operator? What kind of message does he have?” (The sentence means he met the telegraph worker, who had a message for him. The “operator” is a telegraph operator. He must have a telegraph message for John Durmont.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask students to reread this sentence: “A complicated situation had arisen in Amalgamated Copper, and an immediate answer was needed.” Then ask: “What does this tell us about the message Durmont received? How does Durmont respond to this message?” (The message seems urgent, as it involved a “complicated” situation and needs an “immediate answer.” Durmont walks back to the office and tells them to “rush the answer.”)</p></li>
<li><p>Reread the following sentence: “The tall lank youth, whose every movement was a protest against being hurried, dragged himself over to the telegraph key.” Ask: “How does this description develop the character of the youth?” (It shows that he doesn’t really want to help with sending the message but does so anyway.)</p></li>
<li><p>Turn and Talk with your triad partners about the context clues you can use to discern what it means that the wire was “open.” (It means it is not working.)</p></li>
<li><p>Reread the final sentence of the section: “‘Lineman’s paid to look up trouble; I’m not,’ was the surly answer.”</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “What is the youth’s attitude about the line not working?” (The youth says it is not his job to help him.) “What does this show about his character?” (It shows that he seems to want to only do the minimum for his job and is not interested in helping Durmont more than he needs to.)</p></li>
<li><p>Invite students to add the “youth” to the character section of their note-catcher and a description of the character.</p></li>
<li><p>Direct students’ attention to their Story Elements: “His Motto,” Part I note-catcher, and ask them to work in triads to answer only question 1 in the box labeled “Scene 2 Interactions.” Ask for student volunteers to share out, then inform students that they will return to this question.</p></li>

<li><p>Remind students that <strong>colored</strong> was an adjective used to describe black Americans, which is no longer used. Tell students that later in the story the boy will be introduced as Robert Hilton, so they will refer to him by this name as they discuss the story. Ask students to record “Robert Hilton” in a character box on their note-catchers.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “What is Durmont’s initial reaction to Hilton’s offer to help with the message?” (He is sarcastic and asks Hilton if he is going to bring the message “in an ox team.”) “Why does Durmont turn to the operator to ask his question?” (Because he is prejudiced against Hilton and does not think he is capable because he is young and black.) “How does the description of Hilton and his response to Durmont develop his character and contrast him with Durmont?” (Hilton is described as quiet, while Durmont is described as having “thundered” at the youth in the telegraph office. Durmont reacts to Hilton in a prejudiced way, but Hilton maintains his confidence and answers him coolly: “I can send it by wireless, if that is sufficiently quick.”) Invite students to add this information to the “Character” and “Description” sections for Hilton on the note-catcher.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “What happens at the end of this excerpt?” (Durmont goes with Hilton to send his message on the wireless.) Remind students that the setting is Maine, and there is only one telegraph line nearby. “How do these facts about the setting influence what happens in the plot?” (Because Durmont needs to send the message and there is only one line, he is forced to go with the Hilton.)</p></li>
<li><p>Invite students to work in triads to answer questions 2 and 3 in the “Scene 2 Interactions” box on their Story Elements: “His Motto,” Part I note-catcher.</p></li>
<li><p>Review with students the plot, setting, and characters in the notes they’ve taken so far. Now tell students that they will focus on this scene in the telegraph room in order to examine point of view more closely, looking for evidence about how the author develops each character’s different point of view about Hilton’s offer to help with the wireless.</p></li>

<li><p>Remind students of their work identifying and describing points of view in Module 1. Remind students that point of view is how a character views a certain situation or event. Characters’ points of view will differ, depending on their experiences, habits, and values. Tell students that they should look for dialogue and description that help establish the point of view of each character and how it develops.</p></li>
<li><p>Direct students’ attention to the “Zoom In” section on their note-catchers. Ask students to work in triads, assigning one of the characters to each: the youth, Durmont, or Hilton, to each member of the group. Ask each member of the group to identify their character’s point of view on Hilton’s offer to help. Ask students to consider: “What does this character think of Hilton’s offer? How does my character react to Hilton’s offer to help? What dialogue or description helps the reader understand my character’s point of view?” Instruct students to identify phrases from the text that help describe the points of view each character takes of this situation. Remind students to look for dialogue as well as descriptions of the character to gather evidence for the points of view for each character.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask for student volunteers from different groups to share their responses about the characters’ points of view about Hilton’s offer to help.</p></li>
