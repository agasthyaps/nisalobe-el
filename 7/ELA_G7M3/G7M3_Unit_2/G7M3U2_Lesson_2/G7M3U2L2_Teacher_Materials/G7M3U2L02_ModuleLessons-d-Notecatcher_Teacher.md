| Description                                                                                                                                                                                                     | **fifteen years old, inventor, described as having a quiet voice, confident in his own abilities** |

**Scene 1 Interactions**

| Who is speaking in this section? What do they say to each other? How does their conversation influence the plot?                                                                                                                                                                        |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The people speaking are **Durmont and his doctor.** The doctor says that Durmont should **go on vacation because he is worried that Durmont will die if he doesn’t take a vacation.** Their conversation influences the plot because **Durmont takes his advice and travels to Maine.** |

|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|

**Scene 2 Interactions**

| What is the plot so far? What is the youth’s reaction to Durmont’s situation?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                       |                       |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| So far, **John Durmont needs to send an important message, but the telegraph youth isn’t helpful and says the line is broken.** The youth reacts to Durmont’s situation by **being “surly” and refusing to try anything to improve the telegraph.**                                                                      |                       |                       |
| What is Durmont’s reaction to Hilton’s offer? How does Hilton influence the plot?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                       |                       |
| Durmont reacts to Hilton’s offer by **being sarcastic and asking Hilton if he is going to bring the message “in an ox team.” He seems to be prejudiced against Hilton because he is black.** Hilton’s offer affects the plot because **Durmont, despite his prejudice, agrees to come with him to deliver the message.** |                       |                       |
| Why is the setting important to the plot?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                       |                       |
| The setting is important because **it means that Durmont must find another way of sending the message, since he is in a remote area with few options to communicate.**                                                                                                                                                   |                       |                       |
| ![](media/image1.png)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | ![](media/image1.png) | ![](media/image1.png) |
