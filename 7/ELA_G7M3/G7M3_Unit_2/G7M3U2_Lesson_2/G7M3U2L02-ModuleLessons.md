Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RL.7.4 – Opening A: On an entrance ticket, students read a mystery quote and write a brief response about its meaning and what it suggests about the story they will read today.

- RL.7.3 – Work Time A: Students participate in a close read of “His Motto” to explore the elements of the story and how they interact.

- RL.7.6 – Work Time A: Students participate in a close read of “His Motto” to determine different characters points of view and how they compare and develop.

- RL.7.2 – Closing and Assessment A: Students work as a class to begin to determine and analyze themes in “His Motto.”

- In this lesson, students focus on becoming effective learners by working collaboratively during the close read and to answer questions about the text.

- The Think-Pair-Share protocol is used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- In this lesson’s excerpt of “His Motto,” Robert Hilton shows initiative in suggesting that he can help send Durmont’s message. He also perseveres in the face of Durmont’s prejudice and continues to believe in his own ability.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release more responsibility more quickly to students as they comprehend the tasks or concepts. For example:

- Allow those students who are more readily identifying the elements of the story and understanding different points of view the opportunity to develop their own text-dependent questions about the story. Ask these students to share their questions with the group as a way of generating discussion.

- Invite students to participate in collaborative discussions regarding the text so they can grow their thinking.

- Invite students to do a think-aloud explaining how they arrived at a given answer to a text-dependent question.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students have focused on analyzing the techniques that the poets and artists of the Harlem Renaissance used to create meaning in their work. In this lesson, students look more closely at short stories and begin to analyze how elements in the stories interact to create meaning.

Support All Students

- The subject matter in this excerpt includes descriptions of racism. Continue to monitor students to determine if issues surface from the content of this story that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually. To support students in processing this content, ask: “What habit of character did you use as you read and discussed this story?” Students may need to draw on perseverance, empathy, and compassion as they read and discuss this content, being sensitive to their own and others’ reactions to the information presented.

- Students may need additional support to understand the historical context for the story. Use visual aids to explain how telegraphs worked. ▲

- Note that there are differentiated versions of the Story Elements: “His Motto,” Part I note-catcher used in Work Time A and Homework: Answer Questions: “His Motto,” Part I used for homework in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson includes a teacher-led discussion and pair collaboration to guide students to read the second half of “His Motto” and analyze the interaction of story elements and the development of points of view.

- ELLs may find it challenging to gradually release from the class close read analysis to pair collaboration. Form strategic pairs, triads, or small groups to support students who may need more guidance analyzing the story.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, 7.I.B.6, and 7.I.C.10.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ note-catchers and Questions about the Text to ensure understanding.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will finish reading “His Motto” and synthesize understanding how the characters, setting, and plot interact as well as how the author develops and contrasts points of view.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RL.7.4 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 2**.

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique to review their responses.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

- Encourage students to extend their vocabulary learning by using the words in sentences and then sharing their words and sentences with a partner. Doing so will not only ensure that students have another chance to reinforce the vocabulary they identified while reading but also to learn new vocabulary from their peers.

For Heavier Support

- For the entrance ticket, encourage students to work in pairs to first paraphrase the quote and then discuss it. Have a share-out to ensure students fully comprehend the quote before writing about it. Also, encourage students to use the words in the questions to create sentence frames for their responses. As necessary, model doing so with the first question:

- To me this quote means . . . because . . .

Work Time

A. Close Read: “His Motto” – RL.7.3 (35 minutes)

- Review appropriate learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can explain how the setting shapes the characters and plot in ‘His Motto.’”

“I can identify the points of view of Durmond, Hilton, and the ‘youth’ in ‘His Motto.’”

“I can explain how an author develops and contrasts the points of view of Durmond, Hilton, and the ‘youth’ in ‘His Motto.’”

- Focus students on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart** and remind them that digging into the text deeper can help them understand it better, so they are going to dig deeper into an excerpt of the text through close reading.

- Move students into predetermined triads.

- Direct students’ attention to the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart** and review what collaboration looks and sounds like.

- Use **Close Reading Guide: “His Motto,” Part I** to set the purpose of the close read and to guide students through a close read of this excerpt. Refer to the guide for how to integrate the following:

- **“His Motto”** by Lottie Burrell Dixon

- **Story Elements: “His Motto,” Part I note-catcher**

- **Story Elements: “His Motto,” Part I note-catcher** ▲ as necessary. The differentiated note-catcher supports students’ writing and comprehension with sentence frames. ▲

- Refer to **Story Elements: “His Motto,” Part I note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time A, if it wasn’t done in the previous lesson, review the information paragraph at the top of the students’ copies of the story **“His Motto”** and make sure students understand the setting and what a telegraph machine is. Students who understand the information in the paragraph can paraphrase it for their classmates. Rephrasing the information will ensure that students understand it and give them the opportunity to practice speaking about the setting.

- Also in Work Time A, if time allows, encourage students to form groups of five to act out the dialogues between Durmont and his doctor and Durmont and the two telegraph boys. Students who need lighter support can take the roles of Durmont, the doctor, and the narrator—reading the lines around the dialogue. Acting out will engage students with the story and reinforce their comprehension of the characters, setting, and plot events.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time A, if it wasn’t done in the previous lesson, read the information paragraph at the top of the students’ copies of the story **“His Motto”** and make sure students understand the setting of the story. If possible sketch or display a picture of a telegraph machine and use pantomime to help students understand that it was used to send messages.

- Also in Work Time A, if time allows, encourage students to form groups of five to act out the dialogues between Durmont and his doctor and Durmont and the two telegraph boys. Students who need heavier support can take the roles of the boys. Acting out will engage students with the story and increase their comprehension of the characters, setting, and plot events.

- Finally in Work Time A, encourage students to use the **Story Elements: “His Motto,” Part I note-catcher** ▲. This resource includes sentence frames that support students in comprehension and writing about the interactions of story elements and how the author develops points of view.

Closing and Assessment

A. Explore Themes: “His Motto” – RL.7.2 (5 minutes)

- Display and draw students’ attention to the **Harlem Renaissance Themes anchor chart**. Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What possible themes do you see emerging in the text so far?” (Possible response: There is a theme that you should work hard no matter what others think of you, and a theme that prejudice keeps people from recognizing others’ humanity and worth.)

“How is the author developing these themes?” (Possible response: The author is developing these themes by showing how Durmont doubts Hilton because of his race and age, but how Hilton remains confident in his own abilities to send a message over wireless.)

- Add the emerging themes that students identify to the Harlem Renaissance Themes anchor chart. Tell students that they will have an opportunity to return to these themes and confirm or revise them once they finish reading the story.

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share about the following question:

“What habits of character did you see in this excerpt? Who demonstrated them? What did they look/sound like?” (Possible response: Hilton shows initiative in suggesting that he can help send Durmont’s message. He also perseveres in the face of Durmont’s prejudice and continues to believe in his own ability.)

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- Allow students extra think time to identify a theme in the story. As necessary, prompt with questions such as:

- What are the characters learning about prejudice or believing in yourself? What does the story tell us about prejudice or believing in yourself?

For Heavier Support

- Provide students with a sentence frame to share their thoughts about theme, so that they have the language structures for comprehension and to participate fully in the discussion:

- The author’s message is that prejudice / achieving dreams is \_\_\_\_.

Homework

A. Answer Questions: “His Motto,” Part I

- Students complete **Homework: Answer Questions: “His Motto,” Part I** to analyze point of view and story elements in the first part of the story “His Motto” to demonstrate understanding of the story elements and points of view.

B. Preread “His Motto”

- Students preread the second half of the story “His Motto” and identify and define at least three words of unfamiliar vocabulary in preparation for studying the end of the story in the next lesson.

For Lighter Support

- Before students leave class, ask them to read the homework assignments and discuss them with a partner. Encourage students to spend time brainstorming vocabulary and language structures to write about the theme of the story. Challenge students to include at least one example of the present perfect verb (has/have + past participle; for example, the author has shown) in their writing.

- Also, work with students to develop a list of prereading strategies that students who need lighter support can use when prereading on their own. These may include the following:

- Use an English dictionary to clarify the meaning of unfamiliar words.

- Ask and answer simple questions about the chapter using *who*, *what*, *where*, *when*, *why*, or *how* questions.

- Create a “mind-map” to connect important details, characters, or events to one another.

- In the margins, take notes on the gist of each paragraph.

For Heavier Support

- Before students leave class, review the homework assignments and ensure that students understand that they will answer questions and preread the second part of the short story “His Motto.” To ensure success on the homework, encourage students to use the Homework: Answer Questions: “His Motto,” Part I ▲. This resource includes sentence frames which support students in comprehension and writing.

- Also, work with students to develop a list of prereading strategies that students who need heavier support can use when prereading on their own. These may include the following:

- Use a translation dictionary to verify the meaning of unfamiliar words.

- Skim and scan for the names of key characters, places, or events.

- Isolate and read the first sentences of each paragraph, noting important plot details.

- In the margins, illustrate the key plot events of the story.
