Interactive Flowchart Directions

RL.7.2, RL.7.4, RL.7.5, L.7.5

1.  Choose an Interactive Flowchart card. Read the card aloud (e.g., “The Negro Speaks of Rivers”).

2.  Using an arrow card, connect this card to another Interactive Flowchart card by form, language, and/or theme, (e.g., “I Shall Return”).

3.  Read the second card aloud.

4.  Explain why the two Interactive Flowchart cards belong together, how one shows collaboration with the other by form, language, and/or theme. (E.g., “The Negro Speaks of Rivers” is connected to “I Shall Return” by the theme of the connection to nature and one’s past. In “The Negro Speaks of Rivers,” the speaker tells of being connected to all the ancient rivers that his African and black American ancestors worked and lived near, showing his connection to nature and his past. In “I Shall Return,” the speaker tells of wanting to go back home where there are “sapphire skies” and “bending grasses,” which shows his connection to a past home and to natural beauty.)

5.  Another member of the group takes a turn by either:

- Adding a new arrow and another card anywhere on the “flowchart.”

- Verbally explaining a new connection between any of the cards already connected on the table.

- Writing a form (structure, repetition, rhyme), language technique (figurative, connotative), or theme from the poetry or artwork on an index card and then using an arrow to add it to the flowchart.

6.  Take turns using the remaining Interactive Flowchart cards and continuing to explain the connections between them.

7.  The activity ends when time is up or when all cards have been used and group members have explained all the connections they see.
