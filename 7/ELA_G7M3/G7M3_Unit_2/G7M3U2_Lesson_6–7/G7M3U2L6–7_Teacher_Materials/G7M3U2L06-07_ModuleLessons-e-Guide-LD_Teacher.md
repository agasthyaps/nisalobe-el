Language Dive: “The Boy and the Bayonet,”  
Part III, Paragraph 19 Sentence Chunk Chart

RL.7.6, L.7.1, L.7.4b

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

**“I told you we was more prouder** dan if you’d won,’ said ‘little sister.” (“The Boy and the Bayonet” by Paul Laurence Dunbar, Part III, paragraph 19)

Launch

Prior to the Language Dive, consider inviting students to review the meaning of **standard English grammar and usage** per L.7.1. It may be most effective to present students with multiple definitions of standard English retrieved from distinct sources (e.g., from the dictionary vs. from an academic article written by a linguist). Students are likely to find that no clear definition of **standard English** exists, despite this being a common term that many use freely. The curriculum uses the term **academic English** to describe language expectations.

Remind students that this text includes dialogue that varies from **standard English**, as mentioned in previous lessons, in order to capture how spoken language sounds in different times and places.

said “little sister.”

Deconstruct

- Ask:

“What does this chunk tell us?” (That the dialogue in this sentence is said by “little sister.” Said “little sister” is the dialogue tag used to identify who is speaking.)

- **“little sister”**

“Can you figure out why the author put quotation marks around “little sister”? Why does the author refer to this character as “little sister” rather than giving her a name?” (The quotation marks signal an unofficial name given to this character. By referring to this character as “little sister” rather than giving her a name, the author is emphasizing the importance of this character’s relationship to Bud, the main character in the story.)

“I told you we was more prouder

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Ask:

“What does this chunk tell us?” (“Little sister” is speaking directly to Bud, telling him that she and their mom were proud of something.)

- Students can take 30 seconds in pairs to discuss what happened that made Bud’s mom and “little sister” proud. Then, invite them to discuss what “little sister” will compare this to. Encourage them to refer to the text as they do so. (Responses will vary, but may include: they were proud of the way Bud acted after losing the competition. “Little sister” may compare this to how proud they would have been if Bud hadn’t lost the competition.)

- **we was**

“What do you notice about the subject-verb agreement in this chunk?” (The subject and verb do not agree. We is a plural subject, but the verb form in this chunk is singular \[was\]. In academic English, a subject and verb must agree in number, meaning if there is a plural subject there must also be a plural verb form, making it we were instead of we was \[subject + verb\].)

- Circle **we was more prouder**. Then, display **we were more proud** near this chunk. Read aloud this chunk with both varieties: **we was more prouder/we were more proud**.

- **we was more prouder**

“In our classroom English academic prose, we would usually write we were more proud. Can you figure out why “little sister” said we was more prouder instead?” (To signal the use of a variety of English that is used in some language communities. The author uses a local variety of English that varies from academic English when providing dialogue by Bud’s mother and “little sister” as a way to develop the characters’ identities, sharing that they are a part of the local community where this variety of English is used. Note that more prouder adds emphasis to how proud “little sister” and their mom were, by using both the adverb more and the comparative suffix -er. \[plural pronoun + singular verb form + comparative adjective\].)

- Students can work in pairs to identify one or two other examples of the local variety of English in the text. Encourage students to specifically look for examples where the subject-verb agreement varies from that of academic English. (Examples: “We is proud,” she whispered, “we’s mos’ prouder dan if you’d won,”; “You ain’t a-goin to back down, is you, Buddie?”) Invite students to write the example(s) on their note-catchers. 

- **  
  Students can use Conversation Cues as they discuss. To provide heavier support, display a suggested sequence, such as the one below:**

- Goal 1: Can you say more about that?

- Goal 2: Who can tell us what your classmate said in your own words?

- Goal 4: Who can add on to what your classmate said?

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Students can complete the following sentence frames using the present perfect verb tense, using both academic English and the variety of English used in “little sister’s” dialogue. (Refer to the previous language dive, which focused on present perfect verb tense, for support.) 

> I told you we \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ proud of you.
>
> present perfect verb tense of **is**
>
> **(I told you we <u>have been</u> proud of you.)**
>
> I told you we \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ proud of you.
>
> singular present tense verb tense of **is**
>
> **(I told you we <u>has been</u> proud of you.)**

- Invite students to discuss when each variety of English would be used. (Responses will vary, but may include that academic English would be used in the classroom, while a more local variety of English would be used within the community where it is spoken, and among people from the local community.)

- To provide lighter support: Invite students to extend the frames, using the conjunction **because** to include a reason:

> **I told you we \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_proud of you** because **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**
>
> (e.g., I told you we <u>have/has been</u> proud of you because <u>you have always chosen to do the right thing, even when it proves to be hard</u>.)

- To provide heavier support: Provide present tense verb phrases on index cards for students to choose form when completing the frames.

dan if you’d won,”

Deconstruct

- **dan**

“What do you think the word dan means? What does it tell us about this chunk?” (Dan means than, as pronounced in the local variety of English used by “little sister” and her mom. Than is used to compare two things that are not equal. It tells us that what follows would have made “little sister” and their mom less proud of Bud than they were for what happened \[conjunction\].)

- **if you’d won**

“What would have made “little sister” and their mom less proud of Bud than they were for what happened?” (If Bud had won, instead of dropping his bayonet and losing the competition, they would have been less proud. \[conjunction + pronoun + past perfect verb form \[past tense of “have” + past participle = past perfect\].)

- Students can discuss in pairs why “little sister” and their mom were more proud of Bud for what happened than if he had won. (Responses will vary, but may include that they were proud of Bud’s conduct when he lost because it demonstrated Bud’s habits of character. It would have been easy for Bud to show self-control and to keep trying if he was winning, but it took integrity and perseverance to do so after he dropped his bayonet and lost, which is why Bud’s “little sister” and mom were more proud of him for this than if he had won.)

“I told you we was more prouder dan if you’d won,” said “little sister.”

Reconstruct

- **“I told you we was more prouder dan if you’d won,” said “little sister.”**

“In what classroom contexts will we use this variety of English? In other classroom contexts, what variety of English will we use?” (If the variety of English used in this story is commonly spoken within one of your language communities, it may be appropriate to use this variety of English during casual in-class conversations with friends or with others from your language community. If it is not spoken within one of your language communities, it would be respectful to get to know and learn from members of the community where it is spoken before considering using their local variety. In other classroom contexts, it would be more appropriate to use academic English.)

“Does Dunbar only use a local variety of English in this text? What, in the text makes you think so?” (No. Dunbar switches from using the local variety of English when Hannah and “little sister” are speaking, to using academic English throughout the rest of the text.) Pairs can identify one or two examples of academic English used in the text.

- Ask:

“Do you ever use a variety of English that is different from the variety of English we use in the classroom? How is the language we speak a reflection of our identity?” (Answers will vary.)

“How does this sentence help us understand a theme of this text?” (Answers will vary, but may include: a theme of this text is that from failure can come great learning; failure helps us grow. This sentence helps show that “little sister” and their mom love and are proud of Bud even though he failed, and that they understand failure will help him grow.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Answers will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target:  
I can identify the points of view of Tom, Hannah, and “little sister” in “The Boy and the Bayonet”? (by showing how “little sister” and their mom, Hannah, support Bud continuing with bayonet, even after he had failed)

Practice (Sentence)

- Invite students to say and write this sentence in their own words. Encourage students to use a variety of English they use outside of the classroom, or their home language to do so. 

- To provide lighter support: “Can you write the sentence in a different order?” (e.g., By placing the dialogue tag at the beginning or in the middle of the dialogue)

- To provide heavier support: Work with students to identify the parts of the sentence that use a local variety of English (e.g., **we was**; **prouder**, **dan**) and discuss how these parts of the sentence vary from academic English before students write in their own words.

Language Chunk Wall Suggestions

- Language to compare: **“I told you we was <u>more prouder</u>**

- Language to talk about conditional situations: **dan <u>if</u> you’d won,”**

- Verbs and verb phrases (actions, states of being): **“I <u>told</u> you <u>we was</u> more prouder, dan if <u>you’d</u> won,”**

- Language to introduce dialogue: **said “little sister.”**
