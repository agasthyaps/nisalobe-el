Interactive Flowchart Directions

RL.7.2, RL.7.4, RL.7.5, L.7.5

1.  Choose an Interactive Flowchart card. Read the card aloud (e.g., “His Motto”).

2.  Using an arrow card, connect this card to another Interactive Flowchart card by form, language and/or theme, (e.g., “The Boy and the Bayonet”).

3.  Read the second card aloud.

4.  Explain why the two Interactive Flowchart cards belong together, how one is similar to another in form, language, and/or theme (e.g., “His Motto” is connected to “The Boy and the Bayonet” by the theme of persevering to reach one’s dreams. In “His Motto,” the boy named Robert Hilton has a quote by Abraham Lincoln on his wall, “I will study and make ready, and maybe my chance will come.” This quote speaks to the importance of working hard in pursuit of your dreams, which Robert does as he perseveres despite prejudice to learn electronics, help an important businessman, and get a good job. In “The Boy and the Bayonet,” the theme of perseverance to reach one’s dreams occurs through Bud’s failure in dropping the bayonet. Even though he makes a big mistake, he perseveres and returns to school and once again wears his uniform in order to reach his dreams.)

5.  Another member of the group takes a turn by either:

- Adding a new arrow and another card anywhere on the “flowchart.”

- Verbally explaining a new connection between any of the cards already connected on the table.

- Writing an element of form (structure, repetition, rhyme), element of language (figurative, connotative), or theme from the poetry or artwork on an index card and then using an arrow to add it to the flowchart.

6.  Take turns using the remaining Interactive Flowchart cards and continuing to explain the connections between them.

7.  The activity ends when time is up or when all cards have been used and group members have explained all the connections they see.
