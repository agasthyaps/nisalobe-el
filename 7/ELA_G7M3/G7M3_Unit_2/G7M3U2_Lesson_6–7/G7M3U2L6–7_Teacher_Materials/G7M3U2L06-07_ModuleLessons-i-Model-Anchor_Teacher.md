<td>In the story “The Boy and the Bayonet,” the character Bud seems to be preparing for a big day, which he has been working hard at for some time. The big day finally arrives, and Bud drops his bayonet during the competition. <strong>Bud does not want to go to school due to his mistake, and he decides not to wear his uniform due to his embarrassment. He goes to Assembly, where the judge from the competition discusses how well Bud handled himself in spite of the mistake. Bud feels better about himself.</strong></td>

<p><strong>You should not let fear stand in the way of your dreams. When you make a mistake, keep your head high and persevere.</strong></p></td>

<td><p>“Someone had dropped his bayonet. But with muscles unquivering, without a turned head, the company moved on as if nothing had happened, while one of the judges, an army officer, stepped into the wake of the boys and picked up the fallen steel.” (Part II)</p>
<p>When the failure occurs, the company moves on as if nothing had happened and perseveres.</p>
<p>“Come on, Buddie,” whispered ‘little sister,’ “Mammy an’ me know you didn’t mean to do it, an’ we don’t keer.” (Part II)</p>
<p>Bud threw his arms around his little sister and held her tightly.</p>
<p>“It’’s only you an’ ma I care about,” he said, “though I am sorry I spoiled the company’s drill; they say “B” would have won anyway on account of our bad firing, but I did want you and ma to be proud.” (Part II)</p>
<p>“We is proud,” she whispered, “we’s mos’ prouder dan if you’d won,” and pretty soon she led him by the hand to supper. (Part II)</p>
<p>This conversation between Bud and “little sister” shows that Bud’s family is proud of him no matter what, and failure is okay.</p>
<p>“I saw the whole proceeding; I saw that he did not pause for an instant, that he did not even turn his head, and it appeared to me as one of the finest bits of self-control I had ever seen in any youth; had he forgotten himself for a moment and stopped, however quickly, to secure the weapon, the next line would have been interfered with and your whole movement thrown into confusion.” (Part III)</p>
<p>The officer helps Bud realized how well he handled the mistake, and how proud he should be of himself. Through mistakes, we learn a great deal.</p>
<p>“‘I told you we was more prouder dan if you’d won,’ said ‘little sister’.</p>
<p>‘An’ what did I tell you ’bout backin’ out?’ asked his mother.</p>
<p>Bud was too happy and too busy to answer; he was brushing his uniform.” (Part III)</p>
<p>This part shows that having a family’s support when mistakes are made helps one persevere in the face of challenge. Pride doesn’t only come from watching someone succeed; it also comes from watching someone struggle and persevere.</p></td>

| How does the author or artist develop the theme? (For artwork, the theme may be communicated by different parts of the piece or the whole piece and may not develop over the course of the piece. However, details may add to or change the theme.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| The author develops this theme through the dialogue and actions of the three characters showing how Bud can persevere through this failure. The author develops the theme through the officer’s discussion of Bud’s mistake as a strength and place of learning, and the principal’s discussion of how proud Bud should be to wear his uniform. At the end, the author drives this point home through “little sister’s” pride in her brother, and Hannah’s insistence that he didn’t give up when faced with challenge. |
