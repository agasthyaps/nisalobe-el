**Scenes 4 and 5 (School and Back Home)**

| How does the scene at school impact Bud?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                       |                       |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| The scene makes Bud feel **grateful and proud.** He feels this way because **he is praised for his discipline in front of everyone, and his classmates cheer.**                                                                                                                   |                       |                       |
| How does Bud’s return home impact Hannah and “little sister”?                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                       |                       |
| Bud’s return makes Hannah and “little sister” feel **proud.** This shows that **they were right to encourage him to go into school.** For example, “little sister” says **she was “prouder” than if he had won.** Also, Hannah asks, **“what did I tell you ‘bout backin’ out?”** |                       |                       |

| What is a theme of the story? How does the author develop it?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                   |
| A theme of the story is **that success and failure are a part of life. It’s important to “fail forward” and be proud of our loved ones in success and in failure. You can learn a great deal from failure.** The author develops this theme through **the points of view of all the characters and the way they support and encourage Bud.** For example, **when Bud comes home after dropping the bayonet, his sister and mother encourage him, telling them they’re proud of him and know he will have another chance.** These examples develop the theme that **it is important to “fail forward” and be proud of our loved ones in success and in failure.** |                                                                                                                   |
