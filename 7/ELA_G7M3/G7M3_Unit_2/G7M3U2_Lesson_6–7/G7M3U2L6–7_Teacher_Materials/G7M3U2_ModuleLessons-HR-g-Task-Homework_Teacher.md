Homework: QuickWrite: Failing Forward

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Write about a time you failed at something or made a big mistake. How did people around you support you or fail to do so? What did you learn? Why is it important to fail forward and have a growth mindset in life? (RL.7.2)

Answers will vary, but may include: It was conference championships for swimming. I was in the 200-yard freestyle event, and I might’ve won. It was just me and this one other girl for the spot at the top of the podium. No one else had times close to ours. I went into the first 50 yards and rolled to the side to take a breath. No air came in. I went into my first flip turn without any oxygen. I tried again for a breath after the first flip turn, and I couldn’t breathe. I was out in front, up ahead, without getting any air. All of a sudden, my body shut down. It felt like everything went black, and I didn’t have a choice. I stopped swimming. I heard my coach yell, “Turn over on your back!” I did and waited to regain normal breathing.

The girl I was up against said cattily to me, “Why’d you stop?” My teammates mimicked her question. I explained that I had an asthma attack and there was nothing I could do. My mom hugged me. My coach hugged me. I took my albuterol medication and vomited, which often happens when I’m in respiratory distress. Twenty minutes later I was up on the blocks again for the 200 freestyle relay. My mom said, “You’ve got this. You’re fine.” My coach smiled, nodded encouragingly and told me I was going to crush it.

I did crush it. I was just fine. We won that relay. That event taught me so much about failure. It’s part of life, certainly, but those around you can make or break your experience. My mom and coach told me to try again. My teammates and competitor made me feel like I should leave the pool deck forever. The important thing is that I didn’t give up. I got back on the blocks and swam beautifully. Asthma happened, but I persevered and I didn’t let it stop me. Through hard work, perseverance, and a growth mindset, we can just keep getting better and better at the things that matter most to us.
