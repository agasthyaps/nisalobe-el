The Harlem Renaissance

Grade 7: Module 3: Unit 2: Lessons 6–7

Lesson Overview

Lesson Summary

Students independently read the third and final part of the short story “The Boy and the Bayonet.” Next, they participate as a class in a Language Dive to analyze the language structures in a dialogue sentence from the story. Students complete the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment by analyzing how story elements interact and how the author develops and contrasts points of view. Then students discuss structural, thematic, and language connections across works they’ve read thus far in the module, adding “His Motto” and “The Boy and the Bayonet” to their Harlem Renaissance Museum Collection.

Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RL.7.3 – Work Time A: Students read “The Boy and the Bayonet,” analyzing how elements of the story interact, including how the author develops and compares characters’ points of view.

- RL.7.6 – Work Time B: In a Language Dive, students explore an excerpt from “The Boy and the Bayonet” to better understand points of view and varieties of English.

- RL.7.10 – Closing and Assessment A: Students track progress on their abilities to read and analyze a new part of the story.

- RL.7.2 – Closing and Assessment B: Students discuss the theme of “The Boy and the Bayonet” and how it is developed over the course of the text as they add it to Harlem Renaissance Museum.

- For the mid-unit assessment in Work Time C of this lesson, students read the story “The Boy and the Bayonet,” analyzing how story elements interact and how the author develops and contrasts points of view. (RL.7.1, RL.7.3, RL.7.6, RL.7.10, L.7.4a).

- Two lessons have been allocated for this assessment to ensure sufficient time for students to analyze “The Boy and the Bayonet” for story elements and points of view. If these are taught in two separate lessons rather than together as one block, revisit the learning targets and the task at the beginning of the second 45-minute lesson to remind students of the task and purpose.

- In this lesson, students focus on becoming effective learners by reading and answering questions independently for the mid-unit assessment.

- The Think-Pair-Share protocol is used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- In the excerpt of “The Boy and the Bayonet” read in this lesson, Bud shows courage and perseverance as he returns to school after his mishap. Hannah shows initiative and responsibility as she sets Bud on track. “Little sister” shows empathy and compassion as she holds Bud’s hand. The officer shows the importance of the academic mindset of “my ability and confidence grow with my effort” as he discusses the value of discipline, self-control, and perseverance in light of Bud’s mistake.

- In this lesson, students complete “The Boy and the Bayonet” Story Elements note-catcher, begun in Lesson 4.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release more responsibility more quickly to students as they comprehend the tasks or concepts. For example:

- Allow students to create their own note-catcher, as this is a skill they will need for high school, college, and even in careers. Challenge students to read the learning targets and determine how they would take notes about the interactions between story elements and differing points of view.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students have focused on analyzing how the elements of a story interact and how an author develops and contrasts the points of view of different characters. In this lesson, students will try to work independently on the mid-unit assessment.

Support All Students

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment.

- For some students, this assessment may require more than the time allotted. Provide time over multiple days if necessary.

- The subject matter in these texts includes dialogue spoken in a variety of English. Explain to students that this is a strategy writers use to help capture how spoken language sounds in different times and places. Continue to monitor students to determine if issues surface from the content of this chapter that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually. To support students in processing this content, ask: “What habit of character did you use as you read and discussed this story?” Students may need to draw on perseverance, empathy, and compassion as they read and discuss this content, being sensitive to their own and others’ reactions to the information presented.

- To support ELLs, the assessment in this lesson consists of tasks and questions in the same format as the activities students have completed throughout the unit thus far. This gradual release supports students in independent achievement on this assessment.

- ELLs may find it challenging to independently read the last part of the story. Encourage them to grapple to read the ending independently once, highlighting, illustrating, and taking notes on key events. Then as necessary, allow students to form homogeneous groups to review their highlights, illustrations, and notes ensuring students understand the events.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, and 7.I.B.6.

Assessment Guidance

- All assessment materials (student prompt and teacher checklist) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback on this assessment, use the answer key and sample student responses (see Assessment Overview and Resources).

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue to make connections between texts and ideas as they explore a model literary argument essay on works from the Harlem Renaissance.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Return students’ **Module 3 End of Unit 1 Assessments with feedback**, and allow students time to review feedback and write their name on the board if they require support.

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lessons 6–7**. Students may or may not choose to share their goals for this assessment with a partner or the class.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read “The Boy and the Bayonet” – RL.7.3 (20 minutes)

- Distribute **Story Elements: “The Boy and the Bayonet,” Part III note-catchers** and ask students to retrieve their copies of **“The Boy and the Bayonet.”** Tell students that for the assessment in this lesson, they will answer selected response questions on Part III of “The Boy and the Bayonet,” analyzing how its story elements interact and how the author develops and contrasts the points of view.

- Since this is an assessment, students will read this part of the story independently. Remind students to annotate and text code as they read for story elements and points of view. Students should also take notes on these elements in their Story Elements: “The Boy and the Bayonet,” Part III note-catchers. Release students to begin reading Part III of the story. Circulate to ensure that students are demonstrating comprehension by annotating and taking notes as they read. As necessary, consult the **Story Elements: “The Boy and the Bayonet,” Part III note-catcher (example for teacher reference)**.

- Once students finish reading, ask them to Think-Pair-Share:

“What habits of character did you see in this excerpt? Who demonstrated them? What did they look/sound like?” (Possible response: Bud shows courage and perseverance as he returns to school after his mishap. Hannah shows initiative and responsibility as she sets Bud on track. “Little sister” shows empathy and compassion as she holds Bud’s hand. The officer shows the importance of the academic mindset of “my ability and confidence grow with my effort” as he discusses the value of discipline, self-control, and perseverance in light of Bud’s mistake.)

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time A, encourage students to use the Story Elements: “The Boy and the Bayonet,” Part III note-catcher ▲. This resource includes sentence frames that support students in comprehension and writing.

Work Time

B. Language Dive: “The Boy and the Bayonet,” Part III, Paragraph 19 – RL.7.6 (10 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to facilitate a Language Dive with the following sentence from the text:

- “‘I told you we was more prouder dan if you’d won,’ said ‘little sister.’”

- Use the accompanying materials to facilitate the Language Dive:

- **Language Dive Guide: “The Boy and the Bayonet,” Part III, Paragraph 19 (for teacher reference)**

- **Language Dive: “The Boy and the Bayonet,” Part III, Paragraph 19 Sentence Chunk Chart (for teacher reference)**

- **Language Dive: “The Boy and the Bayonet,” Part III, Paragraph 19 sentence chunk strips**

- **Language Dive: “The Boy and the Bayonet,” Part III, Paragraph 19 note-catcher (example for teacher reference)**

- **Language Dive: “The Boy and the Bayonet,” Part III, Paragraph 19 note-catcher**

For Lighter Support

- During the Language Dive of Work Time B, students analyze the author’s use of a local variety of English. After examining the focus structure, ask students: “Is there a familiar affix in the word *prouder* that helps us understand its meaning?” (The suffix **-** *er* tells us *prouder* is a comparative adjective, signaling a comparison to something else. It tells us that “little sister” and her mom were more proud of Bud for what he did than they would have been if something else had happened. Note that in academic English we would use *more proud* instead of *prouder*.) If necessary, support students with additional questions, such as “Does the affix make this word a noun, adjective, adverb, or something else? What kind of adjective does the affix make *proud*?**”**

For Heavier Support

- During the Language Dive of Work Time B, students analyze the author’s use of a local variety of English. After examining the focus structure, ensure that students understand that the quotation marks around the sentence show what “little sister” is saying. Then ask students to chorally read aloud only the words that “little sister” says.

- Then at the end of the Language Dive ask students to consider the difference between the quotation marks around “I told you we was more prouder dan if you’d won.” and “little sister.” Ensure that students understand that the first set of quotations show what “little sister” is saying. The second set show that the words “little sister” are a nickname for Bud’s younger sister. Challenge students to find other examples of each kind of quotation in the text and share them with a partner and with the class. Record each type of quotation in two columns on the board or on chart paper.

Work Time

C. Mid-Unit 2 Assessment: Analyze Story Elements and Point of View: “The Boy and the Bayonet,” Part III (40 minutes)

- Review appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze how story elements interact and shape one another in ‘The Boy and the Bayonet.’”

“I can identify the points of view of Tom, Hannah, and ‘little sister’ in ‘The Boy and the Bayonet.’”

“I can explain how an author develops and contrasts the points of view of Tom, Hannah, and ‘little sister’ in ‘The Boy and the Bayonet.’”

- Distribute **Mid-Unit 2 Assessment: Analyze Story Elements and Point of View: “The Boy and the Bayonet,” Part III**. Tell students that for this assessment, they will answer selected response questions on “The Boy and the Bayonet,” analyzing how its story elements interact and how the author develops and contrasts the points of view.

- Read the directions for each part of the assessment aloud as students follow along. Answer clarifying questions.

- Before students begin the assessment, ask them to Think-Pair-Share:

“What value does the task of a reading assessment have for you beyond this class? Why?” (Responses will vary. Possible response: This task has a lot of value for me because I will have to take reading assessments in most of my high school and college classes.)

“What will help you succeed on this assessment?” (Responses will vary. Possible response: Using my strategies to answer selected response questions will help me succeed with this task.)

- Direct students’ attention to the following materials:

- **Academic** and **domain-specific word walls**

- **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart**

- **Strategies to Answer Selected Response Questions anchor chart**

- **Vocabulary log**

- **Print or online dictionaries**

- Remind students to refer to these materials as they read the assessment text and answer the assessment questions.

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence. Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart** and review perseverance, taking initiative, and taking responsibility. Remind students that because they will be reading and answering questions independently for the assessment, they will need to practice these habits.

- Invite students to begin the assessment.

- While they are taking the assessment, circulate to monitor and document their test-taking skills.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- Before the mid-unit assessment in Work Time C, challenge students to underline key vocabulary in the assessment directions as they are read aloud together as a class. Also, invite students who need lighter support to restate or clarify information for students who need heavier support. These supports ensure that students understand each task included in the assessment.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time C, read the directions for the assessment slowly, twice, and also post them. This ensures that ELLs who may not be able to easily follow the language of the directions have multiple opportunities to access them.

- Display a “map” of the assessment to reference while explaining directions to the mid-unit assessment. This will reduce ambiguity and give students a clearer picture of what they can expect so that they can better allocate their time and attentional resources. Provide students with colored pencils or highlighters so that they can mark up the map as needed. Example:

Part I:

- Read each excerpt several times, whisper reading them aloud as necessary. Consider finding each excerpt in a copy of the story to get the context and understand the excerpts better.

- Read each question and each possible answer.

- Cross out incorrect answers.

- Select the best answer to the question.

- Repeat steps 2–4 for each question in the assessment.

Closing and Assessment

A. Add to the Museum Collection – RL.7.2 (15 minutes)

- Inform students that they will now add “The Boy and the Bayonet” and “His Motto” to the classroom museum collection. As necessary, remind students that at the beginning of the module they set aside this space to collect all the works that they will study from the Harlem Renaissance.

- Explain to students that before they add this additional text to the museum collection, they will discuss the theme of “The Boy and the Bayonet” and add it to the anchor chart. Invite students to Turn and Talk:

“What is a theme of ‘The Boy and the Bayonet’?” (From failure can come great learning. Failure helps us grow.)

“What evidence of this theme do you see in the ending of the story?” (Bud’s decision to brush his uniform at the end of the story shows how he’s no longer ashamed and ready to persevere with his goals. His failure has not stopped him, but rather made him more determined to succeed.)

“What value does this theme have today?” (In life, there will always be failures. We can see from Bud’s experience that our mistakes help us learn.)

“How does this story connect by theme with other texts or artwork from Units 1 and 2? (The poem “Calling Dreams” has a similar theme about picking yourself back up when things go wrong, and shooting for your goals.)

- Use a total response technique to hear a variety of responses, then record the theme and evidence on the **Harlem Renaissance Themes anchor chart**.

- Ask students to form triads. As they do so, distribute the **Interactive Flowchart directions** to each triad and read aloud the steps. Remind students that they have participated in this protocol before, during Unit 1. As necessary, model how to complete the activity.

- Place the **Interactive Flowchart cards and arrows** on the board using magnets, tape, or technology. Leave space between the cards.

- Model and review the Interactive Flowchart activity directions:

- Choose an Interactive Flowchart card. Read the card aloud (e.g., “His Motto”).

- Use an arrow card to connect this card to another Interactive Flowchart card by form, language, and/or theme (e.g., “The Boy and the Bayonet”).

- Read the second card aloud.

- Explain why the two Interactive Flowchart cards belong together, and how one is similar to another in form, language, and/or theme. (“His Motto” is connected to “The Boy and the Bayonet” by the theme of persevering to reach one’s dreams. In “His Motto,” Robert Hilton has a quote by Abraham Lincoln on his wall, “I will study and make ready, and maybe my chance will come.” This quote speaks to the importance of working hard in pursuit of your dreams. In the story, Robert studies hard despite prejudice against him and is rewarded with a job of his dreams. In “The Boy and the Bayonet,” the theme of perseverance to reach one’s dreams is developed through Bud’s failure in dropping the bayonet. Even though he makes a big mistake, he perseveres and returns to school and once again wears his uniform to reach his dream of getting a good education.)

- Another member of the group takes a turn by doing one of the following:

<!-- -->

- Adding a new arrow and another card anywhere on the flowchart.

- Explaining a new connection between any of the cards already connected on the table.

- Writing an element of form (structure, repetition, rhyme), element of language (figurative, connotative), or a theme from the poetry or artwork on an index card and then using an arrow to add it to the flowchart.

<!-- -->

- Take turns using the remaining Interactive Flowchart cards and continuing to explain the connections between them.

- The activity ends when time is up or when all cards have been used and group members have explained all the connections they see.

- Invite students to create the Interactive Flowchart in triads. Once students complete their flowcharts, ask volunteers to share with the class one new connection they made. Ask:

“What connections can you make in theme between the pieces you are adding to the museum collection?” (“His Motto” and “The Boy and the Bayonet” are about persevering to reach one’s dreams.)

- Invite two students to formally add the following texts to the museum: “The Boy and the Bayonet” and “His Motto.”

- Remind students to use a loud, clear, formal presentation voice, and invite a few students to share how the pieces connect by a theme to other texts and artwork in the collection.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. QuickWrite: Failing Forward

- Students complete **Homework: QuickWrite: Failing Forward** to write about a time that they failed at something or made a big mistake.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.

For Lighter Support

- Before students leave class, ask them to read the homework assignment. Ensure that students understand that *failing forward* means making a mistake and learning from it. Ask students to share with a partner an example of a time they failed and what they learned from their failure. This oral processing helps confirm comprehension and advances their speaking, listening, and writing skills.

For Heavier Support

- Before students leave class, review the homework assignment and ensure that students understand that *failing forward* means making a mistake and learning from it. Encourage students to create a comic strip or graphic version of their failure story, adding descriptions and dialogue as they are able.
