Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- L.7.1a – Opening A: On an entrance ticket, students explain the function of the clauses in the introduction paragraph of their pair essay.

- L.7.1b – Work Time A: Students sort sentences from the Model Essay by sentence type.

- W.7.1b – Work Time B: Students work in pairs to draft their first Proof Paragraph, choosing the best evidence to support their point and using logical reasoning to explain how it does so.

- RL.7.1 – Closing and Assessment A: Student pairs join with another pair to form groups of four in which they share their claim and the best evidence they found to support it.

- In this lesson, students focus on becoming effective learners, focusing on collaborating with peers and persevering to write a Proof Paragraph.

- The Think-Pair-Share protocol is used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release students who are ready to read and analyze the model Proof Paragraph 1 independently and move on to drafting Proof Paragraph 1 to their practice essay with a partner rather than during modeling.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lessons, students analyzed the structure of the model essay using the Painted Essay® template and wrote their introduction. They build on those foundations in this lesson.

Support All Students

- In Lessons 8–12, students work with the same partner on a pair argument essay. Provide differentiated mentors by purposefully preselecting student partnerships. Meet with the mentors in advance to encourage them to share their thought process with their partner. ▲

- Students may need additional support while writing their Proof Paragraphs. Group those students for a guided discussion to help them find the best evidence to support their claim and to elaborate on that evidence, using logical reasoning to explain how it supports the point. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson includes the use of manipulatives and whole-class instruction to understand the different types of sentences and the key structures of Proof Paragraphs. Also, the collaboration of writing a pair essay supports students.

- ELLs may find it challenging to generate language for writing their Proof Paragraph. In addition to the supports below, encourage students to use oral processing and their home-language to assist them in articulating their ideas.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, 7.I.B.6, 7.I.B.7, 7.I.B.8, 7.I.C.11, 7.I.C.12, 7.II.A.1, 7.II.A.2, 7.II.B.3, 7.II.B.4, 7.II.C.6, and 7.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- Use the Grade 7 Writing Process Checklist to assess students’ writing abilities in Work Time B (see the Tools Page at http://eled.org/tools).

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will write the second Proof Paragraph of their essays, drawing on the planning work in this and the previous lessons.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Ensure there is a copy of Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 10 at each student’s workspace.

- Provide differentiated mentors by strategically grouping students for work in Work Time A with at least one strong reader per pair.

- Cut apart the Proof Paragraph Sentence strips and Sentence Type labels and organize them using envelopes or paperclips so that each group has one set. Or students can prepare this at the start of the activity.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous modules to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.7.1a (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 10**.

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique for students to share examples of each kind of phrase or clause from their entrance ticket work.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

- As necessary, with students, use the vocabulary strategies on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart** to review the words *logical* (resulting from clear thinking), *reasoning* (explanations of why a claim is true, including explanations of how the evidence proves the claim), *relevant* (related to the claim being discussed), *evidence* (information such as examples, data, facts, and quotes that support an idea), and *Proof Paragraphs* (middle paragraphs of an essay that state a main point and provide evidence to explain or support that point). Record these words on the **academic word wall** with translations in home languages, where appropriate, and invite students to record words in their **vocabulary logs**.

For Lighter Support

- On Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 10, ensure that students understand that they should use the information from their homework to identify and explain the phrases. As necessary, students can use the wording from their homework to explain their own phrases. Providing this support will ensure that students can complete the task and further practice identifying phrases and their functions, which supports them in improving their writing skills.

For Heavier Support

- On Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 10, ensure that students understand that they should use the information from their homework to identify and explain the phrases. Draw together these students in a group, and ask volunteers to share a sentence from their homework. As a group, work to identify phrases and explain their functions. After several examples, if students are demonstrating comprehension, challenge students to work in pairs to share sentences and identify phrases and their functions. Providing this support will ensure that students can complete the task and further practice identifying phrases and their functions, which supports them in improving their writing skills.

Work Time

A. Sort Sentences from the Proof Paragraphs – L.7.1b (15 minutes)

- Remind students of the work they have been doing in entrance tickets and homework. Ask volunteers to define *dependent* and *independent clauses* for the class. Display the **Model Introduction sentence strips**. Explain that these are sentences from the introduction of the model they have been working with and that the writer uses a variety of sentence types to express ideas. Read aloud each example, ask students to identify the clause(s) in the sentence, and then explain each sentence type:

“The writers and artists of the Harlem Renaissance had many themes to convey, but one of the most important was that looking back to the past can provide strength and hope in the present.” (compound sentence because it has two independent clauses joined by a comma and a conjunction)

“Many of the works of the Harlem Renaissance showed how important the past is for understanding ourselves.” (simple sentence because it has one independent clause despite having several phrases to help express a complicated idea)

“Of the works we’ve studied so far, however, the painting *African Phantasy: Awakening* and the poems ‘The Negro Speaks of Rivers’ and ‘Lift Every Voice and Sing’ most clearly demonstrate the theme of finding strength and hope by looking back to the past. (complex sentence because it has one dependent clause and one independent clause)

“Of the works we’ve studied so far, however, the painting *African Phantasy: Awakening* most clearly demonstrates the theme of finding strength and hope by looking back to the past, and the poems ‘The Negro Speaks of Rivers’ and ‘Lift Every Voice and Sing’ also clearly demonstrate this theme.” (compound-complex sentence because it has one dependent clause and two independent clauses)

- Explain to students that writers choose among these types of sentences to vary their writing and to communicate different connections between complex ideas. For example:

- “In the first sentence, the second independent clause contrasts or gives a more specific idea from the first independent clause.”

- “The second sentence is just one independent clause with a lot of phrases to show that all the ideas are closely connected.”

- “The third and fourth sentences use a complex and compound-complex structure to communicate a complicated idea with a lot of related parts.”

- Record the words *simple sentence*, *compound sentence*, *complex sentence*, and *compound-complex sentence* on the **domain-specific word wall** with translations in home languages where appropriate, and invite students to add the words to their vocabulary logs.

- Move students into predetermined groups. Distribute **Proof Paragraph sentence strips** and **Sentence Type Labels**. Explain that students will now work as a group to determine the type of each sentence and discuss how that type of sentence shows a different relationship among ideas.

- Answer clarifying questions.

- Invite students to begin working. Circulate to support them in reading and sorting the strips, and encourage students to explain their placement to their partners. Support students with the **Proof Paragraph Sentence strips (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Refocus the whole group.

- Have students choral read the first Proof Paragraph and explain the main point as well as the function of the sentences in the paragraphs. Invite students to help record the parts of a Proof Paragraph on the **Criteria of an Effective Argument Essay anchor chart**.

- Point out that within this Proof Paragraph the author has chosen the best evidence to support the point. Next, the author elaborated on the evidence presented, connecting ideas using logical reasoning. This reasoning connects one piece of evidence to another and explains how the evidence supports the main claim of the piece.

- If productive, cue students with a challenge:

“What if the writer did not include phrases like ‘Like Reiss’ painting’ and ‘For example’? I’ll give you time to think and discuss with a partner.” (We wouldn’t know how the information in the sentences is connected to the evidence.)

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time A, ask students to Turn and Talk to explain each type of sentence in their own words. Circulate to ensure students understand the nuances between the types of sentences. If time allows once students have sorted the sentences and confirmed their answers, challenge them to extend their learning and practice by identifying the types of sentences in Proof Paragraph 3 of the Model Literary Argument Essay.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time A, draw together these students in a group and model identifying one of each type of sentence, using a think-aloud such as: *I am looking for a simple sentence, a sentence that has one subject and one verb and tells a complete thought. Here is a sentence, but it has a comma, so I want to make sure that the words that come before/after this comma are a phrase not a clause with a subject and a verb*. Once this has been modeled identifying one of each type of sentence, challenge students to work together to sort the rest of the examples.

Work Time

B. Pairs: Draft Proof Paragraph 1 – W.7.1b (20 minutes)

- Review appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can write Proof Paragraph 1 of my pair argument essay using logical reasoning and relevant evidence from the text to support my point.”

- Tell students they are now ready to draft Proof Paragraph 1. Explain that in this lesson, they are only drafting Proof Paragraph 1, and they will draft Proof Paragraphs 2 and 3 in the next lesson. Remind students that as they draft this Proof Paragraph, they should elaborate by using reasoning to explain how the evidence they have chosen supports their thinking.

- Distribute **paper**. Invite students to retrieve the following materials:

<!-- -->

- **Argument Writing checklist**

- **Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer**

- **Model Pair Argument Essay**

- The texts and artwork from Units 1 and 2: ***Shuffle Along***, **“Lift Every Voice and Sing,” *The Harp***, **“Calling Dreams,” “Hope,” “I Shall Return,” *Ethiopia Awakening, African Phantasy: Awakening***, **“The Negro Speaks of Rivers,” “His Motto,”** and **“The Boy and the Bayonet”**

<!-- -->

- As necessary, guide students through writing their Proof Paragraph 1:

- Discuss the following characteristics on the Argument Writing Checklist, adding to the Characteristics of My Informative column as needed.

<!-- -->

- “W.7.1b: I support my claim with logical reasoning and relevant evidence.”

<!-- -->

- Invite students to read their Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer and the introduction started in the previous lesson to remind them of their main claim and their points.

- Invite students to refer to the Model Argument Essay, the Criteria of an Effective Argument Essay anchor chart, the Argument Writing Checklist, and the domain-specific and academic word walls to write Proof Paragraph 1.

- Remind students that it is often helpful to orally rehearse the words they will use to explain the point and supporting evidence before writing. Invite students to begin rehearsing and composing Proof Paragraph 1 with their partner. Circulate to support students as they write and to identify common issues to use as whole group teaching points.

- Invite students to record Y for yes and the date in the final column of their Argument Writing checklist if they feel the criteria marked on their checklists have been achieved in their writing in this lesson.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Closing and Assessment

A. Share Best Evidence – RL.7.1 (5 minutes)

- Ask student pairs to join with another writing pair to form groups of four. Invite all students to Think-Pair-Share with their small group:

“What is one piece of the best evidence you found and included in your Proof Paragraph 1? Why is it strong evidence? How did you use reasoning to elaborate on or explain the connection between the evidence and your main point?” (Responses will vary.)

- As time allows, ask volunteers to share their responses with the class.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- Challenge students to rephrase the W.7.1b criteria on the Argument Writing checklist into simpler language that their peers who need heavier support can understand. Rephrasing the criteria ensures that students comprehend the writing expectations.

- Encourage students to underline the language structures in Proof Paragraph 1 of the Model Essay that can be used in their pair essay. For example, “The xxx (work) clearly shows xxx (theme).” Students can share these examples with their classmates who need heavier support. Then they can modify them for their own pair essay. Also, challenge students to use one of each type of sentence in their Proof Paragraph. Using the model and crafting different types of sentences will improve their writing abilities.

For Heavier Support

- If students are literate in their home language, they can translate the W.7.1b criteria on the Argument Writing checklist that their peers who need lighter support rephrased. Translating or rephrasing the criteria ensures that students comprehend the writing expectations.

- Encourage students to use the language structures from the model essay to craft their own Proof Paragraph. Students can use the sentences as frames, replacing the theme, works, and evidence with those that fit their pair essay. Have students who need lighter support help students identify these language structures. For example, “The xxx (work) clearly shows xxx (theme).” Using the model will give students confidence and success with a complex writing task.

Homework

A. Choose Sentence Types

- Students complete **Homework: Choose Sentence Types: Introduction Paragraph** to choose different types of sentences that effectively communicate ideas in the introduction paragraph of an essay about the Harlem Renaissance.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
