**Directions:** Imagine that you are writing an essay on themes of the Harlem Renaissance. Complete the sentence stems using **and**, **but**, and **however**. (L.7.1a, L.7.1b)

Answers will vary, but may include:

**Stem:** The writers and artists of the Harlem Renaissance had many themes to convey

1.  The writers and artists of the Harlem Renaissance had many themes to convey, and

> **they did so through art, texts, music, and performance.**

2.  The writers and artists of the Harlem Renaissance had many themes to convey, but

> **one important theme is the importance of community and collaboration.**

3.  The writers and artists of the Harlem Renaissance had many themes to convey;

**Stem:** Many of the works of the Harlem Renaissance showed the importance of community and collaboration

1.  Many of the works of the Harlem Renaissance showed the importance of community

and collaboration, and **many works showed other themes important in the Harlem**

**Renaissance.**

2.  Many of the works of the Harlem Renaissance showed the importance of community

> and collaboration, but **three works show this theme most clearly.**

3.  Many of the works of the Harlem Renaissance showed the importance of community

> and collaboration; however, **three works show this theme most clearly.**

**Directions:** Using these independent and dependent clauses, create your own compound, compound-complex, and simple sentences. Add punctuation, such as commas and periods, and change capitalization as necessary. Then below each new sentence, explain the purpose of the sentence. (L.7.1a, L.7.1b)
