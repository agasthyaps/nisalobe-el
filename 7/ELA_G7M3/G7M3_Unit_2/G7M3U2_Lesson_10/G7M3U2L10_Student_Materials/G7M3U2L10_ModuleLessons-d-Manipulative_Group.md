Proof Paragraph Sentence Strips

L.7.1b

**Directions:**

1.  Cut apart the sentence strips. The first six are sentences from the model essay. The last four are labels showing the four types of sentences you have learned about.

2.  Read and organize the six sentences, sorting them by type of sentence. Place each simple sentence under the “simple sentence” label, each compound sentence under the “compound sentence” label, etc.

3.  Discuss as a group how the sentence type shows different relationships between ideas.
