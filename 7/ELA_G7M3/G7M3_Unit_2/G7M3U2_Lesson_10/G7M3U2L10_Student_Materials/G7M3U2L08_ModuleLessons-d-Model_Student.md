The writers and artists of the Harlem Renaissance had many themes to convey, but one of the most important was that looking back to the past can provide strength and hope in the present. Many of the works of the Harlem Renaissance showed how important the past is for understanding ourselves. Of the works we’ve studied so far, however, the painting *African Phantasy: Awakening* and the poems “The Negro Speaks of Rivers” and “Lift Every Voice and Sing” most clearly demonstrate the theme of finding strength and hope by looking back to the past.

The painting *African Phantasy: Awakening* by Winold Reiss clearly shows how the artists of the Harlem Renaissance found strength and hope by connecting to the past. It is clear that the figures in *African Phantasy* are from the ancient past, but the artist has shown them in a new way. The two people in front are surrounded by ancient images and dressed like they are from the past, but they are captured in motion and seem to be full of energy. This makes them seem alive in the present. The figures are dancing, and the natural images around them are beautiful, which can speak to people in the present. Taken together, these images show that by celebrating the figures of the past in a new way, the painter provides strength and hope for the present.

In his poem “The Negro Speaks of Rivers,” Langston Hughes develops the same theme of finding strength and hope in the past. Hughes uses figurative language to describe the “Ancient, dusky rivers” (12). At first, the rivers might seem to have nothing to do with the present. However, the poem is structured to describe every river and event from the past as if the speaker were a part of them. “I built my hut near the Congo” (6), he says. “I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young” (8), he writes. Like Reiss’ painting, these lines show events that happened long ago still feel present to the speaker. Also, the events he describes shows how his ancestors have overcome difficulties and achieved great things in the past. For example, Hughes describes how the “muddy bosom” of the Mississippi River turns “all golden in the sunset” (9–10). He is talking about how his ancestors moved out of slavery into freedom, and he is reminding readers of the long journey of history and the importance of hope. The poem powerfully shows how looking back at the past can bring hope because of the beauty and strength it can provide.

Just like Reiss and Hughes, James Weldon Johnson clearly develops the theme that the past can bring hope and strength in his poem “Lift Every Voice and Sing.” This poem is about remembering the past while pursuing liberty. Each of the stanzas is structured to acknowledge both the difficulty of the past and the triumph. The speaker encourages everyone to “sing a song full of faith” that comes from the “dark past” (7). The poem also uses figurative language to describe how the speakers have arrived at “the place for which our fathers sighed” (16). He ends the song by asking his listeners to remain “true to our native land” (33) and the strength that comes from remembering the past. This poem strongly shows the theme that the past can bring hope and strength.

Reiss, Hughes, and Johnson all powerfully develop the theme of how looking back to the past can bring hope and strength. The theme is presented differently in each piece, but it shines through strongly in all three works. Reiss’ painting *African Phantasy: Awakening* captures the power of the past and brings it into the present. Hughes also develops this theme in the poem “The Negro Speaks of Rivers” by highlighting events throughout the past that the poet still feels connected to. Johnson’s poem “Lift Every Voice and Sing” emphasizes how the struggle of the past provides strength and hope for the present. A curated collection in a museum centers on a common theme, and these three works powerfully celebrate a lost past and bring it into the present. Sometimes this means remembering how far people have come from a dark past, and sometimes it means remembering triumphs of history. However, it almost always means keeping the memories of the past alive to show a better way for the present and the future.
