<p>Reiss, Hughes, and Johnson all powerfully develop the theme of how looking back to the past can bring hope and strength. The theme is presented differently in each piece, but it shines through strongly in all three works. Reiss’ painting <em>African Phantasy: Awakening</em> captures the power of the past and brings it into the present. Hughes also develops this theme in the poem “The Negro Speaks of Rivers” by highlighting events throughout the past that the poet still feels connected to. Johnson’s poem “Lift Every Voice and Sing” emphasizes how the struggle of the past provides strength and hope for the present.</p>

<p>A curated collection in a museum centers on a common theme, and these three works powerfully celebrate a lost past and bring it into the present. Sometimes this means remembering how far people have come from a dark past, and sometimes it means remembering triumphs of history. However, it almost always means keeping the memories of the past alive to show a better way for the present and the future.</p>
