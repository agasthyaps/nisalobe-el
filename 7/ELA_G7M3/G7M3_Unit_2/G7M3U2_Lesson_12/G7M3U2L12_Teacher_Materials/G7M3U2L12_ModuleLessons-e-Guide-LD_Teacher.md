Reiss, Hughes and Johnson all powerfully develop the theme

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- **Reiss, Hughes, and Johnson**

“Who is this chunk about?” (Reiss, Hughes, and Johnson—the artist and writers of  
the three works of the Harlem Renaissance highlighted in this essay \[noun phrase\].)

- **powerfully develop the theme**

“What does this chunk tell us?” (That these artists and writers powerfully develop a common theme: the tells us there is a specific theme all of these works have in common, which we will learn more about in the subsequent chunk \[adverb; verb phrase\].)

- **all**

“Can you figure out why the author included the word all?” (All is used for emphasis; the author included all to emphasize that each one of the artists and writers mentioned in this sentence powerfully develops a common theme through their works \[adjective\].)

- Invite students to discuss in pairs what they remember about the common theme in each of the works by the artist and writers mentioned in this chunk. Encourage them to review the three Proof Paragraphs to support their discussion, as well as to review the main claim from the introductory paragraph displayed during the launch. Then, they can list the themes they discussed on their note-catcher. 

- Display the third chunk from the Module 3, Unit 2, Lesson 9 Language Dive (**the painting *African Phantasy: Awakening* and the poems “The Negro Speaks of Rivers” and “Lift Every Voice and Sing” most clearly demonstrate the theme**).

“How is this chunk similar to the third chunk of the main claim of this essay?” (Responses will vary, but may include: Both chunks reference the three main points of the essay—the works of the Harlem Renaissance by Reiss, Hughes, and Johnson. Both chunks also state that these three works represent a common theme.)

“How are the chunks different?” (This chunk references the artist and writers of the three works, whereas the main claim references the titles of the works themselves. Additionally, this chunk states that the works “powerfully develop” a theme, whereas the main claim states that the works “clearly demonstrate” the theme.)

- Students can discuss in pairs why they think the author used the word **demonstrate** in the main claim and **develop** to restate the claim. (Responses will vary, but may include that because the main claim previews the three main points, the word **demonstrate** might be used to simply show that a common theme is present. However, when restating the claim, the word **develop** might be used to invite the reader to reflect on the three Proof Paragraphs, which provide details about how the common theme is developed in each of the works.

- **Students can use Conversation Cues as they discuss. To provide heavier support, display a suggested sequence, such as the one below:**

- Goal 1: Can you say more about that?

- Goal 2: So, do you mean \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?

- Goal 3: Do you agree or disagree with what your classmate said? Why? I’ll give you time to think.

- Goal 4: Who can add on to what your classmate said?

name of classmate name of classmate name of classmate

> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ developed the habit of character of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ this year. 

adverb habit of character

- To provide lighter support: “Can you extend the frame, describing how the students have developed the habit of character?” (e.g., “\_\_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_ have all \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ developed the habit of character of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **by** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.)

- To provide heavier support: Provide a language bank with varying habits of character for students to choose from (e.g., hard work, perseverance, initiative, responsibility, determination).

“What is the relationship between our Language Dive sentence and the main claim from the introductory paragraph?” (Our Language Dive restates the main claim, meaning it says the same thing in a different way.)

“What if the model essay did not include our Language Dive sentence? How would that weaken the essay overall?” (If the model essay did not include our Language Dive sentence, it would not refocus readers on the main claim. It would weaken the essay by not reminding readers to recall the overall purpose of the argument, before inviting them to reflect on how this specific information connects to a bigger picture.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target:  
I can write the conclusion of my argument essay, restating the main claim and adding a reflection.” (Responses will vary.)
