**Focus Question**

As a curator, you have decided to create a Harlem Renaissance exhibit focusing on the theme that collaboration and community can bring out the best in people. Choose three works for the exhibit that most powerfully illustrate this theme, and write an argument essay defending your claim about why these works are such a powerful illustration of this theme.

**Introduction Paragraph**

How will you catch the reader’s attention? (Consider using facts, statistics, quotations, or anecdotes.)

strong statement about the HR theme

What context about the text or topic does your reader need in order to make sense of the rest of your essay?

works, artists/writers, and theme from the Harlem Renaissance

Counterclaim: What counterclaim might others raise to refute your claim?

Many of the works of the Harlem Renaissance show the importance of community and collaboration.

Briefly refute: How do you respond to this counterclaim?

However, these three works show the theme most clearly.

**Main Claim**

Of the works we’ve studied so far, however, the poem “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” the artwork *The Harp*, and the story “The Boy and the Bayonet” most clearly demonstrate the theme of how collaboration and community bring out the best in people.

**Proof Paragraph 1**

Point 1: What is the first point you are offering to support your claim?

The poem “Lift Every Voice and Sing” by James Weldon Johnson clearly shows the theme that collaboration and community can help bring out the best in people.

Context: What context does the reader need to understand the evidence you are using?

the title and author of the piece

Evidence: What evidence from the text(s) supports this point?

uses “our” and “we” to show people speaking together

“Let our rejoicing rise” (4)

“Let us march on till victory is won” (9)

figurative language: the speakers may pass through a “way that with tears has been watered” (16), but they also talk about how they stand in “the white gleam of our  
star” (19)

Elaboration: What reasons or reasoning develop your point and tie the point back to the claim?

shows the power of sticking together through difficult times

shows community and collaboration are essential to help people overcome

obstacles and bring out the best in one another

**Proof Paragraph 2**

Point 2: What is the second point you are offering to support your claim?

In her sculpture *The Harp*, Augusta Savage develops the same theme of the importance of community and collaboration to bring out the best in people.

Context: What context does the reader need to understand the evidence you are using?

description of the sculpture

Evidence: What evidence from the text(s) supports this point?

shows people as being connected like the strings on a harp

at the edge of the harp, a young man holds a piece of music

Elaboration: What reasons or reasoning develop your point and tie the point back to the claim?

shows the power of people working together

suggests music is made in collaboration

music is important, so a powerful statement

**Proof Paragraph 3**

Point 3: What is the third point you are offering to support your claim?

Paul Laurence Dunbar develops the theme of the importance of collaboration and community to bring out the best in people in the text “The Boy and the Bayonet.”

Context: What context does the reader need to understand the evidence you are using?

Bud (main character), Hannah (mom), and “Little Sister”

Evidence: What evidence from the text(s) supports this point?

Bud drops his bayonet, but family, officer, and eventually schoolmates support him.

family: “were all cheerful” as Bud prepared for his drills; when he makes a mistake, they’re upset

officer: reminds the students of the true meaning of discipline and team work; Bud couldn’t stop to fix his mistake or the team would have been “thrown into confusion”

Elaboration: What reasons or reasoning develop your point and tie the point back to the claim?

Bud did what was right for his team.

officer: Bud put his community first and brought out the best in himself.

**Conclusion Paragraph**

Restate your claim from the introduction:

Johnson, Savage, and Dunbar all develop the theme that community and collaboration can bring out the best in people.

**Briefly restate your main points:**

Point 1:

Johnson: the long difficult journey of people and their celebration at arriving at their goal together

Point 2:

Savage: people can work together just like an instrument to create music.

Point 3:

Dunbar: even when someone makes a mistake, the community can support him.

**What are your further reflections on this topic?**

- Why does this argument/claim matter?

- What would happen if this claim were not acted upon?

- Who is likely to benefit from this?

A curated collection of works in a museum is centered on a common theme; these works celebrate the power of collaboration and community to bring out the best in people.

When people are struggling, they want to hide from community, but these works show that relying on others, we find our best selves.
