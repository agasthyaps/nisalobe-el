Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- L.7.1b – Opening A: On an entrance ticket, students choose among different types of sentences to review and revise the third Proof Paragraph of their pair essay.

- W.7.1e – Work Time A: Students use The Painted Essay® structure to more closely analyze a model conclusion and add to their understanding of an effective conclusion.

- W.7.1e – Work Time B: Students participate in a Language Dive, analyzing the meaning of a sentence from model argument essay’s conclusion.

- W.7.1e – Closing and Assessment A: Students draft the conclusion of their pair essay, ensuring that it follows from and supports the information in their essay.

- W.7.5 – Closing and Assessment A: Students collaborate with peers to draft the conclusion of their essay.

- In this lesson, students focus on becoming effective learners by collaborating and persevering as they write.

- The Think-Pair-Share and Think-Write-Pair-Share protocols are used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release students who are ready to read and analyze the conclusion paragraph independently and move on to drafting the conclusion to their practice essay with a partner rather than during modeling.

- Use students’ conclusions from previous years or find a set of argument conclusions. Invite students to participate in a Gallery Walk protocol in which they read a variety of conclusions posted around the room and record their notices about what makes a strong conclusion. Debrief the protocol with a synthesis discussion of how to write a strong conclusion.

- Invite students to form pairs. Using a set of argument conclusion paragraphs, have students choose a paragraph they find particularly strong. Invite students to share their notices with a partner. Direct students to switch partners and share a few times.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the second half of this unit, students have been analyzing a model and using their analysis to plan an essay and draft the introduction and Proof Paragraphs. This lesson continues those routines to finish writing the essay.

Support All Students

- In Lessons 8–12, students work with the same partner on a pair argument essay. Provide differentiated mentors by purposefully preselecting student partnerships. Meet with the mentors in advance to encourage them to share their thought process with their partner. ▲

- In Work Time A, students should read the model essay paragraph and paragraph sentence strips independently. If some or all students need more support, read the paragraph aloud and release students to read with their partner. Or suggest that students use technology, such as http://eled.org/0179 or http://eled.org/0220, to read the paragraph aloud. ▲

- In Work Time A, students may require additional support when putting the conclusion paragraph together. If so, pair students heterogeneously for this activity, or group students who may need additional reading and organizing support and guide them through the activity. ▲

- In the Closing and Assessment A, students draft their conclusion. Some students may need to talk through their conclusion before writing it. Others may dictate their conclusion and then have another person or technology record their dictation. Some students may need a movement break, snack, or drink of water before beginning to write. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson includes the use of manipulatives to understand the key structures of a conclusion. Also, the collaboration of writing a pair essay supports students.

- ELLs may find it challenging to generate language for writing their conclusion. In addition to the supports below, encourage students to use oral processing and their home language to assist them in articulating their ideas.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, 7.I.B.6, 7.I.B.7, 7.I.B.8, 7.I.C.11, 7.I.C.12, 7.II.A.1, 7.II.A.2, 7.II.B.3, 7.II.B.4, 7.II.C.6, and 7.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- Circulate to monitor students’ work organizing the sentences in the conclusion. If many made a similar error, teach it whole-group as a learning opportunity and a key element to focus on with conclusion writing.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will complete the end of unit assessment in which they draw on the learning from this and previous lessons to plan, draft, and revise an argument essay independently.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Ensure that there is a copy of Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 12 at each student’s workspace.

- Cut apart the conclusion paragraph strips, and organize them using envelopes or paperclips so that each pair will have one set.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous modules to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.7.1b (10 minutes)

- Invite students to retrieve their **Pair Argument Essay** and work with their partner on the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 12**.

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, form groups of four. Ask students to share the different types of sentences they wrote or revised, explaining how the new sentences better convey information. Invite volunteers to share before and after sentences with the class.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

- As a gradual release for the assessment preparation, encourage students to complete Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 12 without support.

For Heavier Support

- As a gradual release for the assessment preparation and before students complete Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 12, ask them to Turn and Talk to review each type of sentence. Circulate to ensure they remember and understand the nuances between each type. As necessary, review the different sentence types and ask volunteers to share an example of each kind.

Work Time

A. The Painted Essay®: Sort and Color-Code the Parts of the Conclusion – W.7.1e (10 minutes)

- Move students into the same predetermined pairs as in Opening A.

- Distribute the **Organize the Model: Conclusion strips**. Tell students that each pair has been given only one part of the conclusion and that later on they will find the other parts to create a complete conclusion paragraph.

- Invite students to refer to their **Painted Essay® template** to remember the parts of a conclusion paragraph:

- Restated main claim

- Reflection

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What is a main claim?” (a statement of opinion that can be proven or disproven with evidence and reasoning)

“What does it mean to restate something?” (to repeat it using different words)

“What is a reflection?” (a thought that results from deep or serious thinking)

- Explain that each pair needs to find a pair with the other part of the conclusion and put the two pieces together in the right order.

- Tell students that when they have finished, they will check their work against the **Argument Model Essay**.

- Invite students to begin and circulate to support students as they find a pair with a strip that will complete the conclusion. Ask pairs whether they have the restated main claim or the reflection and to explain how they know. Support students with the **Organize the Model: Conclusion strips (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Refocus the whole group.

- Invite students to choral read the introduction and to identify the main claim. Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“Which sentence from the introduction is the main claim?” (“Of the works we’ve studied so far, however, the painting *African Phantasy: Awakening* and the poems ‘The Negro Speaks of Rivers’ and songs like ‘Lift Every Voice and Sing’ most clearly demonstrate the theme of finding strength and hope by looking back to the past.”)

- Invite students to choral read the conclusion and to identify the restated main claim. Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“Which sentence from the conclusion restates the main claim you heard in the introduction?” (“Reiss, Hughes, and Johnson all powerfully develop the theme of how looking back to the past can bring hope and strength.”)

“Which sentences from the conclusion support the information or explanation presented throughout the essay?” (“The theme is presented differently in each piece, but it shines through strongly in all three works. Reiss’ painting *African Phantasy: Awakening* captures the power of the past and brings it into the present. Hughes continues this theme in the poem ‘The Negro Speaks of Rivers’ by highlighting events throughout the past that the poet still feels connected to. Johnson’s poem ‘Lift Every Voice and Sing’ emphasizes how the struggle of the past provides strength and hope for the present.”)

“How do these sentences support the information or explanation presented throughout the essay?” (They remind the reader of the three points and how they relate to the main claim.)

- Focus students on the reflection and ask them to Think-Pair-Share:

“Which sentences show the thinking and reflecting following from the information presented in the essay?” (“A curated collection of works in a museum is centered on a common theme; these works celebrate a lost past and bring it into the present. Sometimes this means remembering how far people have come from a dark past. Sometimes it means remembering triumphs of history. Almost always it means keeping memories alive to show a better way for the present and the future.”)

“How does this thinking and reflecting follow from the information presented in the essay?” (The reflection starts with a statement about how the works celebrate a certain period in the past that is brought into a museum, just like the works in a museum center on a theme. This statement shows another side of the main claim: themes can be powerful and influential. The next two sentences discuss the development of the theme in specific works, emphasizing how the theme is consistent.)

“How are these two parts of the conclusion similar? How are they different?” (Both parts stay focused on the main claim. The first part of the conclusion repeats the main claim and main points. The second part is a reflection that connects this specific information to bigger ideas.)

- Invite students to help record the parts of a conclusion on the **Criteria of an Effective Argument Essay anchor chart**. Refer to the **Criteria of an Effective Argument Essay anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

For Lighter Support

- At the end of Work Time A, challenge students to identify the types of sentences in the conclusion and share this information with their classmates who need heavier support. Doing so will reinforce their own and their classmates understanding of types of sentences.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time A, provide students with already color-coded parts of the conclusion paragraph, so that they can focus on arranging the sentences in the order that makes the most sense.

Work Time

B. Language Dive: Model Argument Essay, Conclusion – W.7.1e (10 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to facilitate a Language Dive with the following reflection sentence from the text model essay:

- “Reiss, Hughes, and Johnson all powerfully develop the theme of how looking back to the past can bring hope and strength.”

- Use the accompanying materials to facilitate the Language Dive:

- **Language Dive Guide: Model Argument Essay, Conclusion (for teacher reference)**

- **Language Dive Chunk Chart: Model Argument Essay, Conclusion (for teacher reference)**

- **Language Dive: Model Argument Essay, Conclusion note-catcher (example for teacher reference)**

- **Language Dive: Model Argument Essay, Conclusion note-catcher**

- **Language Dive: Model Argument Essay, Conclusion sentence chunk strips**

For Lighter Support

- During the Language Dive of Work Time B, students analyze a restatement of the main claim from the introduction. Before beginning the dive, invite students to remind classmates what makes a restatement effective (reviewing the points of the essay and reflecting on them in a new way). Display the main claim statement from the introduction of the Model Literary Argument Essay (Of the works we’ve studied so far, however, the painting *African Phantasy: Awakening* and the poems “The Negro Speaks of Rivers” and “Lift Every Voice and Sing” most clearly demonstrate the theme of finding strength and hope by looking back to the past). Challenge students to write a restatement of the claim for the conclusion. Have volunteers share their restatement with the class.

Challenge students to work in pairs to write a restatement of the claim for the conclusion. Have volunteers share their restatement with the class.

Closing and Assessment

A. Pairs: Draft Conclusion – W.7.1e (15 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can write the conclusion of my argument essay, restating the main claim and adding a reflection.”

- Remind students that as they draft the conclusion, they should restate the focus statement, provide a reflection, and include sentences that follow from and support the information or explanation presented in the rest of the essay.

- Distribute **lined paper**. Invite students to retrieve the following Materials:

<!-- -->

- **Argument Writing checklist**

- **Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer**

- **Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer** ▲

- **Pair Argument Essay**

- The texts and artwork from Units 1 and 2: ***Shuffle Along***, **“Lift Every Voice and Sing,” “Calling Dreams,” “Hope,” “I Shall Return,” *Ethiopia Awakening, African Phantasy: Awakening***, **“The Negro Speaks of Rivers,” “His Motto,”** and **“The Boy and the Bayonet”**

<!-- -->

- Guide students through writing their conclusion:

- Discuss the following characteristic on the Argument Writing Checklist, adding to the Characteristics column as needed:

<!-- -->

- **“** W.7.1e: I have a conclusion that supports my argument and restates my claim.”

<!-- -->

- Invite students to read their Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer, introductory paragraphs, and Proof Paragraphs from previous lessons to remind them of their focus statement and ideas.

- Ask:

“What should your conclusion do?” (restate the main claim and follow from and support the information or explanation presented throughout the essay)

- Have students Think-Write-Pair-Share to restate the main claim of their essay, recording their ideas on the Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer. (Responses will vary. Possible response: “Johnson, Savage, and Dunbar all powerfully develop the theme that community and collaboration can bring out the best in people.”)

<!-- -->

- Invite students to refer to the model essay, the Criteria of an Effective Argument Essay anchor chart, the Argument Writing Checklist, and the **domain-specific** and **academic word walls** to write the conclusion.

- Remind students that it is often helpful to rehearse the words aloud that they will use when they write. Before writing the conclusion, pairs may want to rehearse their ideas for their conclusion paragraph, and how it will restate, reflect on, and follow from the information presented in the rest of the essay. Circulate to support students as they write.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target and the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- Challenge students to rephrase the W.7.1f criteria on the Argument Writing checklist into simpler language that their peers who need heavier support can understand. Rephrasing the criteria ensures that students comprehend the writing expectations.

- Encourage students to underline the language structures in the conclusion paragraph of the Model Essay that can be used in their pair essay. For example, “xxx, xxx, and xxx (works) all powerfully develop the theme of xxx (theme)” and “The theme is presented differently in each piece, but it shines through strongly in all three works.” Students can share these examples with their classmates who need heavier support. Then they can modify them for their own pair essay. Also, challenge students to use one of each type of sentence in their conclusion paragraph. Using the model and crafting different types of sentences will improve their writing abilities.

For Heavier Support

- If students are literate in their home language, they can translate the W.1.2f criteria on the Argument Writing checklist that their peers who need lighter support rephrased. Translating or rephrasing the criteria ensures that students comprehend the writing expectations.

- Encourage students to use the language structures from the model essay to craft their own conclusion paragraph. Students can use the sentences as frames, replacing the theme and works with those that fit their pair essay. Have students who need lighter support help students identify these language structures. For example, “xxx, xxx, and xxx (works) all powerfully develop the theme of xxx (theme)” and “The theme is presented differently in each piece, but it shines through strongly in all three works.” Using the model will give students confidence and success with a complex writing task.

Homework

A. Choose Sentence Types

- Students choose different types of sentences in **Homework: Choose Sentence Types: Conclusion Paragraph** to best communicate ideas in the conclusion paragraph of an essay about the Harlem Renaissance.

B. Review Note-Catchers and Texts

- To prepare for the end of unit assessment in the next lesson, request that students reread their note-catchers and texts.
