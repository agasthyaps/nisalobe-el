Homework: Explain Phrases: Introduction and Proof Paragraph 1

(Answers for Teacher Reference)

In Language Dives throughout the modules, you have learned about phrases. Remember that phrases are groups of words that add detail or important information to a sentence. A phrase might give more information about a noun. For example:

The writers and artists <u>of the Harlem Renaissance</u> had many themes to convey. (The underlined phrase gives more information about “the writers and artists”—it tells which “writers and artists” the sentence is discussing.)

A phrase might give more information about a verb. For example:

One of the most important themes was that looking back to the past can provide strength and hope <u>in the present</u>. (The underlined phrase gives more information about “can provide”—it tells when the past “can provide strength and hope.”) Be careful! Phrases that tell more about verbs may be next to nouns, but they tell more about how, when, or where about the verb.

You will use phrases in your own argument writing to give more information about nouns or verbs. Knowing the function or job of a phrase will help you add phrases to your own writing.

**Directions:** Choose the letter that best tells the function of the underlined phrase. (L.7.1a)
