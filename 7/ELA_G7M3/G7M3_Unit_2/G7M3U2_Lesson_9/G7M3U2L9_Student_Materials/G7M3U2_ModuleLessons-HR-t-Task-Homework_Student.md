Homework: Explain Clauses: Proof Paragraph 1

**Name:** **Date:**

In Language Dives throughout the modules, you have learned about clauses. Remember clauses are groups of words that have a subject and a verb. There are two kinds of clauses:

A **dependent clause** is a group of words that has a subject and a verb but doesn’t tell a complete thought. For example:

<u>Of the works we’ve studied so far</u>, however, the painting *African Phantasy: Awakening* and the poems “The Negro Speaks of Rivers” and “Lift Every Voice and Sing” most clearly demonstrate the theme of finding strength and hope by looking back to the past. (The underlined clause has a subject, “we,” and a verb phrase, “have studied,” but it is an incomplete thought.)

An **independent clause** is a group of words that has a subject and a verb and tells a complete thought. For example:

Of the works we’ve studied so far, <u>however, the painting African Phantasy: Awakening and the poems “The Negro Speaks of Rivers” and “Lift Every Voice and Sing” most clearly demonstrate the theme of finding strength and hope by looking back to the past</u>. (The underlined clause has a subject, **the painting and the poems,** and a verb, **demonstrate,** and it is a complete thought.)

A sentence must have at least one independent clause to be complete and correct. A sentence does not need to have a dependent clause to be complete and correct. However, a sentence can have one or more independent and dependent clauses and still be correct.

You will use clauses in your own argument writing to connect ideas or discuss complex thoughts. Knowing the function or job of a clause will help you add clauses to your own writing.

**  
Directions:** Choose the letter that best tells the function of the underlined clause. (L.7.1a)
