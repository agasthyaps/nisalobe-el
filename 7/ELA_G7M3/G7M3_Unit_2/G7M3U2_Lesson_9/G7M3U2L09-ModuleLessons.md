Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- L.7.1a – Opening A: On an entrance ticket, students explain the function of the phrases in the main claim sentence of their pair essay.

- W.7.1a – Work Time A: Students use the Painted Essay® structure to more closely analyze a model introduction to note how it effectively introduces the topic and previews what is to follow.

- W.7.1a – Work Time B: Students participate in a Language Dive, analyzing the meaning of the model argument essay’s focus statement.

- W.7.1a – Closing and Assessment A: Students work in pairs to draft their introductions, introducing the topic with appropriate context and previewing what is to follow in a clear focus statement.

- In this lesson, students work to become effective learners, collaborating with peers and persevering to write an introduction.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release students who are ready to read and analyze the model introduction independently and move on to drafting the introduction to their practice essay with a partner rather than during modeling.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lessons, students analyzed the structure of the model essay using the Painted Essay® template. The introduction is analyzed in detail so students can begin writing their own essays in this lesson.

Support All Students

- In Lessons 8–12, students work with the same partner on a pair argument essay. Provide differentiated mentors by purposefully preselecting student partnerships. Meet with the mentors in advance to encourage them to share their thought process with their partner. ▲

- Students may need additional support writing their introductions. Group those students and lead the discussion to guide them in making a claim and giving context to the reader about the Harlem Renaissance. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson includes the use of manipulatives to understand the key structures of an argument essay introduction. Also, the collaboration of writing a pair essay supports students in expressing their ideas in writing.

- ELLs may find it challenging to generate language for writing their introduction. In addition to the supports below, encourage students to use oral processing and their home-language to assist them in articulating their ideas.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, 7.I.B.6, 7.I.B.7, 7.I.B.8, 7.I.C.11, 7.I.C.12, 7.II.A.1, 7.II.B.3, and 7.II.B.4.

Assessment Guidance

- Use the Grade 7 Writing Process Checklist to assess students’ writing abilities in Closing and Assessment A (see the Tools Page at http://eled.org/tools).

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will write the first Proof Paragraph(s) of their essays, drawing on the planning work in this and the previous lesson.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.7.1a (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 9**.

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique for students to share examples of each kind of phrase or clause from their entrance ticket work. Next, add *phrase*, *dependent clause*, and *independent clause* to the **domain-specific word wall** with translations in home languages where appropriate, and invite students to add the word to their **vocabulary logs**.

- Remind students that they have learned about these kinds of phrases and clauses in Language Dives throughout Modules 1–3. Inform students that they will continue to work with these phrases and clauses in homework and on entrance tickets for the next several lessons.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

- As necessary, use the vocabulary strategies on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart** to review with students the word *context* (background information necessary for understanding a topic). Record on the **academic word wall** with translations in home languages, where appropriate, and invite students to record words in their vocabulary logs.

Work Time

A. The Painted Essay®: Sort and Color-Code the Parts of an Introduction – W.7.1a (15 minutes)

- Move students into predetermined pairs, and invite them to label themselves A and B.

- Distribute **Organize the Model: Introduction strips**. Tell students that each pair has been given only one part of the introduction and later they will find the other parts to create a complete introduction. Explain that there are three parts to this introduction: context, acknowledgment of the counterclaim, and main claim. Each pair needs to find pairs with the other two parts of the introduction. Next, have the whole group work together to arrange all three parts of the introduction in an order that makes sense.

- Tell students that when they have finished, they can check their work against the **Model Argument Essay** and color code their strips.

- Invite students to begin, and circulate to support students in reading and sorting the strips of the introduction. When the introduction has been assembled, invite groups to use the **Painted Essay® template** and **colored pencils** to underline each part of the introduction in the correct color: red for the context, yellow for Point 1, blue for Point 2, dark yellow for Point 3, and green for the rest of the main claim of the piece.

- Support students with the **Organize the Model: Introduction strips (for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Refocus the whole group. Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“How does the author begin the introduction of the essay? What is the purpose of the first sentence of the introduction?” (The introduction begins with some context about the Harlem Renaissance, which should be colored red.)

“What is the next part of the introduction? What is the purpose of the next sentence in the introduction?” (It acknowledges that many works from the Harlem Renaissance could be chosen to illustrate this theme.)

- Explain that this is called a “counterclaim”—a claim that could be made that is different from the writer’s main claim. In an argument, we want to acknowledge that other opinions are possible. In this introduction, the writer admits that other works could have been chosen to demonstrate this theme. Direct students to color this sentence red because it is part of the introduction and leads to the main claim.

“What is the last part of the introduction? What is the purpose of the last sentence of the introduction?” (It is the sentence that states the main claim of the piece and previews the three points. Each of the works mentioned previews a point that will be made in the essay. The first point should be yellow; the second, blue; and the third, dark yellow. The rest of the claim should be green.)

- Ask if there were any groups that arranged their introductions differently from the model. Invite these groups to explain their thinking, noting that there isn’t only one correct way to assemble or write an introduction. Ask students to Turn and Talk:

“How is the introduction in the model similar to and different from the introduction to the last essay you wrote?” (Both provide context that helps the reader understand the topic. The points we will discuss are still there, but in this model, they are integrated into the main claim statement, and there are three of them. Also, the last sentence is a main claim or opinion, not just a focus statement.)

- Remind students that many arguments do not include the points in the main claim, but this one does.

“Why might the author have chosen to end the paragraph with the main claim this time?” (Answers will vary but may include: It’s a simple, clear statement of the main opinion, and the writer wants the reader to remember it.)

- Invite students to choral read the introduction in the model together as a class, stopping after each sentence to review its function in the paragraph. Invite students to help record or check the parts of an introduction on the **Criteria of an Effective Argument Essay anchor chart**. Refer to **Criteria of an Effective Argument Essay anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time A, provide students with already color-coded parts of the paragraph, so that they can focus on arranging the sentences in the order that makes the most sense.

Work Time

B. Language Dive: Model Essay, Main Claim – W.7.1a, L.7.1a (10 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to facilitate a Language Dive with the following sentence from the model essay:

- “Of the works we’ve studied so far, however, the painting *African Phantasy: Awakening* and the poems “The Negro Speaks of Rivers” and “Lift Every Voice and Sing” most clearly demonstrate the theme of finding strength and hope by looking back to the past.”

- Use the accompanying materials to facilitate the Language Dive:

- **Language Dive Guide: Model Argument Essay, Main Claim (for teacher reference)**

- **Language Dive: Model Argument Essay, Main Claim Sentence Chunk Chart (for teacher reference)**

- **Language Dive: Model Argument Essay, Main Claim sentence chunk strips**

- **Language Dive: Model Argument Essay, Main Claim note-catcher (for teacher reference)**

- **Language Dive: Model Argument Essay, Main Claim note-catcher**

For Lighter Support

- During the Language Dive of Work Time B, students analyze the focus statement (which in this essay states the main claim). Invite students to remind classmates what makes a focus statement effective (using key words from the prompt and expressing the point of the essay). Challenge students to Turn and Talk to grapple with what makes an effective main claim statement (clearly expressing an opinion that can be supported with evidence). Explaining to others helps students confirm their knowledge of language structures.

For Heavier Support

- During the Language Dive of Work Time B, some students may need additional support as they complete the sentence frame in the Practice section. If so, display the habits of character anchor charts: Work to Become Effective Learners, Work to Become Ethical People, and Work to Make the World a Better Place.

Closing and Assessment

A. Pair Writing: Draft an Introduction – W.7.1a (15 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can write an introduction for my essay giving context on the Harlem Renaissance, acknowledging a counterclaim, and clearly stating the main claim of the piece.”

- Display and invite students to retrieve their **Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer** and **Directions for Pair Argument Essay**. Also, display and distribute copies of the **Argument Writing checklist**, and remind students that they used similar checklists in Modules 1 and 2 when they wrote informative essays. The specific characteristics will change for this essay, but they will work as a class to determine these new specific characteristics. Point out the following characteristics on the checklist:

- “W.7.1a: I have an introduction that gives readers the context they need to understand the topic or text.”

- “W.7.1a: I state my claim clearly, and my writing stays focused.”

- “W.7.1a: I fairly acknowledge claims that are different from my own.”

- Ask:

“Are there any specific criteria you should be aware of and list in that column on the checklist?” (Responses will vary, but may include: I list the works and their writers/artists. I tell the theme of the Harlem Renaissance I’m discussing. I tell how other works might also show this theme.)

“What background information does the reader need to be able to understand your essay?” (The reader needs the titles of the work, the kind of work they are, and the names of the writers/artists who made them, also the theme.)

“What are some ideas you have for providing context for this essay?” (I will list the works, types, and creators in the context of the theme.)

- As students share out, capture their responses in the Characteristics of My Argument Essay column as needed.

- Allow time for students to retrieve their copies of the texts and artwork from Units 1 and 2: ***Shuffle Along***, **“Lift Every Voice and Sing,” *The Harp***, **“Calling Dreams,” “Hope,” “I Shall Return,” *Ethiopia Awakening, African Phantasy: Awakening***, **“The Negro Speaks of Rivers,” “His Motto,” and “The Boy and the Bayonet.”**

- Distribute **lined paper**. Invite students to work in their pairs using the Model Argument Essay, the Criteria of an Effective Argument Essay anchor chart, and the Argument Writing Checklist to write an introduction. Remind students to refer to the domain-specific and academic word walls and **online or print dictionaries** as needed, especially for the definitions they provide while giving context in the introduction.

- Circulate to support students as they write. Provide students an opportunity to orally recount the main claim from their Argument Essay Writing Plan graphic organizer and rehearse their sentence with their partner before writing. This may allow them additional time to organize their thinking. Remind students to write in complete sentences and to leave a blank line between each line of their writing. ▲

- Invite students to record Y for Yes and the date in the final column of their Argument Writing checklist if they feel the criteria marked on their checklists have been achieved in their writing in this lesson.

- Before students leave class, ensure students understand the homework assignment, especially the grammar review and examples at the top of the homework. Also, as necessary, allow students several minutes to begin the homework so they can access additional support as necessary. Inform students that they will review their responses with a partner at the beginning of the next lesson.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target and the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- Challenge students to rephrase the W.7.1a criteria on the Argument Writing checklist into simpler language that their peers who need heavier support can understand. Rephrasing the criteria ensures that students comprehend the writing expectations.

- Encourage students to model orally rehearsing their introductions for classmates who need heavier support. Also, challenge students to use language structures that are similar to but not the exact same as those in the model essay. As necessary, encourage students to brainstorm in small groups phrases they can use to replace those in the model essay. Oral rehearsal will strengthen their writing while using the model as a model but not as sentence frames will increase their independence in writing.

For Heavier Support

- If students are literate in their home-language, they can translate the W.7.1.a criteria on the Argument Writing checklist that their peers who need lighter support rephrased. Translating or rephrasing the criteria ensures that students comprehend the writing expectations.

- Encourage students to use the language structures from the model essay to craft their own introduction. Students can use the sentences as frames, replacing the theme and works with those that fit their pair essay. Using the model will give students confidence and success with a complex writing task.

Homework

A. Explain Clauses: Proof Paragraph 1

- Students complete **Homework: Explain Clauses: Proof Paragraph 1** to explain the function of clauses in a Proof Paragraph of the Model Argument Essay.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
