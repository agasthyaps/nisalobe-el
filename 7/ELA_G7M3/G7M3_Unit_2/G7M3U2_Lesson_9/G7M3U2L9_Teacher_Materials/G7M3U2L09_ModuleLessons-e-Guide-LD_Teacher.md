**Sentence**

Of the works we’ve studied so far, however, **the painting *African Phantasy: Awakening* and the poems “The Negro Speaks of Rivers” and “Lift Every Voice and Sing” most clearly demonstrate the theme** of finding strength and hope by looking back to the past. (the main claim of the introductory paragraph of the Model Argument Essay by EL Education)

Launch

Display the Language Dive sentence from Module 3, Unit 1, Lessons 5–6 (**Out from the gloomy past, Till now we stand at last, Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast**) as well as the Language Dive sentence from Module 3, Unit 1, Lesson 10 (**My soul has grown deep like the rivers**) before beginning this Language Dive. Share that the lines used for these Language Dives are from two of the works previewed in this Language Dive, and demonstrate the theme highlighted in this main claim.

Of the works we’ve studied so far,

Deconstruct

- **the works we’ve studied so far**

“What is this chunk about?” (Works from the Harlem Renaissance that we’ve studied in this module so far; works refers to the creations made by the artists and writers of the Harlem Renaissance. \[noun phrase\].)

- Invite students to discuss in pairs the different works they’ve studied so far. Responses will vary, but may include paintings and poetry created by the artists and writers of the Harlem Renaissance.

- **of**

“Can you figure out why the author wrote of?” (Of is a preposition used to compare related things; it tells us the subsequent chunks will make a comparison between the works we’ve studied so far \[preposition\].)

however,

Deconstruct

- Ask:

“Can you figure out why the author wrote however?” (However signals that this sentence will show a contrast between the previous idea in the text (the counterclaim) and the forthcoming idea \[the main claim\]. Other words for however are nonetheless, but, and yet \[adverb; linking word\].)

- Students can read the counterclaim (Many of the works of the Harlem Renaissance showed how important the past is for understanding ourselves) and discuss in pairs what they think the main claim will be, that demonstrates a contrasting idea. (Responses will vary, but may include that some of the works of the Harlem Renaissance demonstrated this theme better than others.)

the painting *African Phantasy: Awakening* and the poems “The Negro Speaks of Rivers” and “Lift Every Voice and Sing” most clearly demonstrate the theme

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Ask:

“What do you notice about this chunk?” (Responses will vary, but may include: this chunk creates a complete sentence; this chunk begins to state the main claim; this chunk refers to varying works from the Harlem Renaissance that have a common theme.)

- **the painting *African Phantasy: Awakening* and the poems “The Negro Speaks of Rivers” and “Lift Every Voice and Sing”**

“What is this chunk about?” (Three of the works of the Harlem Renaissance: the painting African Phantasy: Awakening and the poems “The Negro Speaks of Rivers” and “Lift Every Voice and Sing.” Each of these works previews a point that will be made in the essay \[noun phrase\].)

- **  
  most clearly demonstrate the theme**

“What does this chunk tell us?” (That these works most clearly demonstrate a common theme; the tells us there is a specific theme all of these works have in common, which we will learn more about in the subsequent chunk \[adverb; verb phrase\].)

- Invite students to discuss in pairs what they remember about each of these works, and the common theme they demonstrate. Encourage them to review the previous two sentences in the introductory paragraph to support their discussion, as well as the two language dives displayed during the launch.

- Then, they can list the themes they discussed on their note-catcher. 

- Say:

“This chunk is a complete sentence. However, there are additional chunks in our Language Dive. What kind of information might additional chunks add?” (Responses will vary, but may include: additional chunks might give an explanation, provide additional context, or elaborate on the theme these works have in common.)

- **Students can use Conversation Cues as they discuss. To provide heavier support, display a suggested sequence, such as the one below:**

- Goal 1: Can you say more about that?

- Goal 1: So, do you mean \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?

- Goal 3: Do you agree or disagree with what your classmate said? Why? I’ll give you time to think.

- Goal 4: Who can add on to what your classmate said?

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Students can complete the frame to describe three classmates they feel most clearly demonstrate a common habit of character (e.g., hard work, perseverance, initiative, responsibility, determination).

> Today \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ most

name of classmate name of classmate name of classmate

> clearly demonstrate \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. 

habit of character

- To provide lighter support: “Can you extend the frame, describing how the students show the habit of character?” (e.g., “Today \_\_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_ most clearly demonstrate \_\_\_\_\_ **by** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.)

- To provide heavier support: Provide a language bank with varying habits of character for students to choose from (e.g., hard work, perseverance, initiative, responsibility, determination).

of finding strength and hope

Deconstruct

- Ask:

“What does this chunk tell us?” (This chunk tells us about the common theme the three works most clearing demonstrate—the theme of finding strength and hope.)

- Invite students to discuss in pairs the meaning of **strength and hope**. Then, invite students to refer to the two language dive sentences displayed during the launch, that are lines from two of the works mentioned in the previous chunk. Students can discuss in pairs how figurative language was used in each of these lines to represent strength and hope.

by looking back to the past.

Deconstruct

- **by**

“Can you figure out why the author wrote the word by?” (By is a preposition used to tell us the method or means used to do something. It tells us we will find out the way that people found strength and hope during the Harlem Renaissance.)

- **looking back to the past**

“What is the way people found strength and hope during the Harlem Renaissance?”  
(by looking back to the past)

- Students can discuss in pairs how they think people found strength and hope during the Harlem Renaissance by looking back to the past. Again, invite students to refer to the two Language Dive sentences displayed during the launch to support them in their discussions. (Responses will vary, but may include: Looking back to the past is a reminder of the many difficulties black people have overcome, such as how their ancestors moved out of slavery into freedom. This is a reminder of the long journey of history and the importance of hope.)

Of the works we’ve studied so far, however, the painting *African Phantasy: Awakening* and the poems “The Negro Speaks of Rivers” and “Lift Every Voice and Sing” most clearly demonstrate the theme of finding strength and hope by looking back to the past.

Reconstruct

- **Of the works we’ve studied so far, however, the painting *African Phantasy: Awakening* and the poems “The Negro Speaks of Rivers” and “Lift Every Voice and Sing” most clearly demonstrate the theme of finding strength and hope by looking back to the past.**

- Students can examine the sentence that comes before this one in the model essay: **Many of the works of the Harlem Renaissance showed how important the past is for understanding ourselves.**

“What is the relationship between our Language Dive sentence and the sentence that comes before it?” (Our Language Dive sentence states the main claim, while the sentence before it states a counterclaim.)

“What will come in the next paragraphs of the model essay?” (Three Proof Paragraphs that use logical reasoning and relevant evidence from the text to support each point.)

“What if the model essay did not include our Language Dive sentence? How would that weaken the essay overall?” (If the model essay did not include our Language Dive sentence, it would not have a main claim. It would weaken the essay by making it less clear what the overall purpose of the argument was.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target I can write an introduction for my essay giving context on the Harlem Renaissance, acknowledging a counterclaim and clearly stating the main claim of the piece?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice (Sentence)

- Students can use the following frame to write a main claim for their argument essay, that matches their essay objective: “I can plan an argument essay about how specific works from the Harlem Renaissance demonstrate the theme that collaboration and community can bring out the best in people.”

> Of the works we’ve studied so far, **however**, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_,

name of a work from the Harlem Renaissance

> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

name of a work from the Harlem Renaissance name of a work from the Harlem Renaissance

> most clearly demonstrate the theme that collaboration and community can bring out the best in people. 

- To provide lighter support: “Can you say/write this sentence in a different order?” “Can you think of other similar words or phrases to use instead of **however**?”

- To provide heavier support: Invite students to discuss the meaning of the sentence in home language groups.
