5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

W.7.1c, L.7.1a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

**These are just a few examples that show** that we already have new technologies for replacing plastic. (from paragraph 2 of Model Argument Essay: “Reduce Plastic Pollution in the Beginning of Its Lifecycle”)

**Lesson 10 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after students analyze the model essay in Work Time A.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target (**I can write Proof Paragraph 2 of my pair argument essay with phrases that show the relationship between the points, reasons, and evidence**) and W.7.1c by providing an example of how a transition phrase (**These are just a few examples that show**) is used to explain the relevance of evidence. It also helps to address L.7.1a because it contains a noun clause (**that we already have new technologies for replacing plastic**).

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses a transition phrase (**These are just a few examples**) followed by a noun clause with the purpose of explaining evidence.

- Transfer: These are just a few examples that show + noun clause to explain evidence in the pair argument essay and when writing an argument essay in the End of Unit 2 Assessment.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **<u>These are just a few examples that show</u> that we already have new technologies for replacing plastic.**

- Ask:

“What is the central idea of this sentence?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **These are just a few examples that show**

- Ask:

“What examples is this chunk referring to?” (The examples of alternatives to plastic given in Proof Paragraph 1 of the model essay: edible water bottles, shrimp shells, and mushrooms.)

- As needed, allow students to refer back to Proof Paragraph 1 of Model Argument Essay: “Reduce Plastic Pollution in the Beginning of Its Lifecycle.”

“What’s another way to say show as it used in this chunk?” (illustrate; make clear; clarify; demonstrate; prove)

“What do these examples show?” (That we already have new technologies for replacing plastic.)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **<u>These are just a few examples that show</u> that we already have new technologies for replacing plastic.**

- Ask:

“Can you figure out what kind of clause follows the transition, These are just a few examples that show? How do you know?” (It’s a noun clause; we know this because it starts with that and it is the direct object of the verb “shows.”)

“How does the information in this noun clause connect to the main point of Proof Paragraph 1?” (It explains that the examples given show that there are alternatives for plastic.)

- As needed, allow students to refer back to the topic sentence of Proof Paragraph 1 of Model Argument Essay: “Reduce Plastic Pollution in the Beginning of Its Lifecycle.”

“How can we use transition phrases in our own speaking or writing?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to identify that one way they can use transitional phrases is to explain how the evidence in a Proof Paragraph supports its main point.)

- Ask:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target  
(I can write Proof Paragraph 2 of my pair argument essay with phrases that show the relationship between the points, reasons, and evidence)?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

**These are just a few examples that show \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

noun clause beginning with **that**

(**that** + subject + verb + \[object\] = noun clause)

- Ask:

“Use this frame to write a sentence that explains how evidence in a Proof Paragraph of your pair argument essay supports the paragraph’s main point.”

- Possible student answers:

> **These are just a few examples that show <u>that focusing on reducing plastic pollution at the end of its life cycle by disposing of plastic properly can be extremely effective.</u>**

noun clause beginning with **that**

> (**that** + subject + verb + \[object\] = noun clause)
