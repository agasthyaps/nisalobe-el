End of Unit 2 Assessment: Part II: Revise an Argument Essay

**Name:** **Date:**

**Directions:** Exchange your essays with your partner, and follow the Directions for Tuning Protocol (on a separate handout). Focus on giving feedback on the proper placement of modifying phrases and the use of commas with coordinate adjectives. (W.7.5, L.7.1, L.7.1c, L.7.2, L.7.2a, L.7.2b)

Remember that a modifying phrase describes a noun (person, place, thing, or idea). Dangling modifiers are phrases that are not properly associated with the noun they modify.

Also, remember that coordinate adjectives modify the same noun, and an adjective is a describing word.

**Directions:** Once you have given and received feedback on the proper placement of modifying phrases and the use of commas with coordinate adjectives:

1.  Reread the draft of your essay.

2.  Read the feedback and consider how you can use this feedback to improve your work. You may or may not agree with all the feedback, but you should consider it and incorporate the suggestions that you agree will improve your writing.

3.  Revise your essay to improve the placement of modifying phrases and the use of commas with coordinate adjectives, clearly marking the revisions you have made using a colored pencil.
