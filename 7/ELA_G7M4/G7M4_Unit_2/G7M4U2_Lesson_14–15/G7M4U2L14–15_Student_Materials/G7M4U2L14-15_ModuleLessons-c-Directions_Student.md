W.7.5, SL.7.1

**Name:** **Date:**

1.  Students trade and read one another’s essays.

2.  The partner asks the writer questions to clarify anything they don’t understand. Clarifying questions are matters of fact and answerable with “yes,” “no,” or a single brief sentence.

3.  The partner or group texts codes, annotates, or takes notes on their notices, wonders, stars, and steps.

4.  The partner or group identifies one star (one thing the writer did well) and records it on a sticky note.

5.  The partner or group identifies one step (one thing the writer could improve) and records it on a different-colored sticky note.

6.  The partner or group shares the feedback in a few Conversation Cycles:

Cycle 1: strengths and the star noted

Cycle 2: learning opportunities and the step noted

Cycle 3: questions

7.  Response and clarification: the writer shares out significant points, recognizes powerful feedback, and identifies next steps.

8.  The next writer in the pair or group takes their turn.
