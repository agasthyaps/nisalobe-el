**Purpose and Notes**

- The purpose of this close read is for students to trace the way the author develops her purpose and point of view in a text.

- In this close read, students will focus only on the selected sections of the text, which are related to the author developing her purpose.

- For the sake of time, first read aloud the text.

- After the text is first read aloud, students reread portions of the text as they answer text-dependent questions.

- A note-catcher along with text-dependent questions provide an opportunity for students to determine central ideas and author’s purpose.

- Continue to use discussion protocols (e.g., Think-Pair-Share, Conversation Cues, and total participation techniques) to engage all students in collaborative discussion about the text.

<li><p>Read the whole article aloud as students read along silently. Invite students to Turn and Talk with a partner, and then cold-call students to share out: “What is this text about?”</p></li>
<li><p>Explain that now you will look closely at sections of the text to better understand how the author develops her purpose. Remind students of the work they did in the previous unit analyzing an author’s purpose and point of view. For this close read, they will analyze how an author uses language to make her position clear and distinguish it from other possible positions.</p></li>

<td>Reread the first paragraph.</td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Focus students on the first two sentences: “<strong>Plastic is a wonder. It’s malleable, so it can be molded into a variety of useful objects—from bottles to bags to medical supplies.</strong>”</p></li>
<li><p>Ask:</p></li>
<li><p>What does the word <strong>malleable</strong> mean in this context? What word or phrase helps you determine the meaning of <strong>malleable</strong>? (It means that it can be shaped into different things. The word <strong>molded</strong> helps us determine the meaning of <strong>malleable</strong>.)</p></li>
<li><p>How does the fact that plastic is malleable support the idea that it <strong>is a wonder</strong>? (Plastic is a wonder because it can be shaped or molded into a variety of different objects.)</p></li>
<li><p>What other evidence does the author provide in paragraph 1 to support the idea that plastic is a <strong>wonder</strong>? (The author states that it is “durable and can resist wear and tear” and that people have not been able to get “enough of the stuff.”)</p></li>
<li><p>Given these examples, what is the purpose of this first paragraph? (To describe the benefits of plastic.)</p></li>
<li><p>Distribute and display the Close Read: “Five Weird Materials That Could Replace Plastic” note-catcher, and direct students’ attention to the box labeled “Paragraph 1.” Invite students to work with their group members to note the purpose of the paragraph in the appropriate space. Ask students to include the evidence they identified that supports the author’s purpose in the Evidence section of the box.</p></li>
<li><p>Direct students’ attention to the “Author’s Point of View” prompt and explain that they should use this space to identify the author’s attitude toward the subject of the paragraph. To support them in identifying the point of view, students should use the space labeled “Language that reveals the author’s purpose or point of view” to identify words and phrases that help develop the author’s purpose or point of view about what she is discussing. Explain that they are looking for words that suggest how the author feels about the subject or what her personal view is. Looking for words that show the positive or negative about the subject is a good place to start.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask:</p></li>
<li><p>What is the point of view toward plastic the author is expressing in this paragraph? (The author is expressing the point of view that plastic has many good qualities.)</p></li>
<li><p>What language in the first paragraph helps develop the point of view presented? (Language includes <strong>wonder</strong>, <strong>useful</strong>, and <strong>durable</strong>.) Invite students to include these words in the Paragraph 1 box.</p></li>

<li><p>Focus students’ attention on the first sentence of the second paragraph.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask:</p></li>
<li><p>How does this sentence help to shift the focus of the article? What words or phrases help to shift the focus? (This sentence shifts the focus from the benefits of plastic to the problems of plastic. The author does this by writing, “The problem, of course” to show the reader that plastic is not only wonderful, it is also problematic.)</p></li>
<li><p>Based on this sentence, what is the likely purpose of the paragraph? What words or phrases help us identify the purpose? (The sentence includes the idea that “plastic is pretty rough on the environment.” This shows that the purpose of the paragraph is to describe the negative effects of plastic.)</p></li>
<li><p>How does the rest of the paragraph help to develop this purpose? (The rest of the paragraph gives examples of how plastic affects the environment negatively.)</p></li>
<li><p>What point of view is the author expressing here? (The author is expressing the point of view that plastic causes a lot of harm to the environment.)</p></li>
<li><p>Why might the author begin with the benefits of plastic before moving on to talking about the negative effects? (The author might begin with the benefits of plastic to help distinguish her own point of view on the subject from another common point of view.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask students to return to their Close Read: “Five Weird Materials That Could Replace Plastic” note-catchers and work with their group to note the purpose of this paragraph, as well as evidence, point of view, and language in the Paragraph 2 box.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask:</p></li>
<li><p>How does paragraph 3 continue to develop the purpose in paragraph 2? (It suggests solutions for the problems mentioned in the previous paragraph.)</p></li>
<li><p>What words help show the purpose the author has when describing this? (The phrases “Doom and gloom” and “good news” show that the author is excited to share what she has learned about recent inventions.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask students to return to their Close Read: “Five Weird Materials That Could Replace Plastic” note-catchers and work with their group to note the purpose of this paragraph, as well as evidence, perspective and language in the Paragraph 3 box.</p></li>

<li><p>Assign each group to read about one of the materials from the article.

<td><ul>
<li><p>Remind students that they are reading this article to gather information about the beginning of the plastic life cycle. Explain that the author did not write the article to argue for targeting one particular part of the plastic life cycle. However, we can use the information in the article to think about ways to reduce plastic pollution at the beginning of the plastic life cycle. Invite students to write a brief response detailing how the author’s ideas fit into the beginning of the plastic life cycle, and whether they think those solutions are convincing, and why or why not? (This falls into the beginning of the plastic life cycle because it gives examples of new materials that could replace plastic. So these examples would be used before plastic is created. While the author presents interesting ideas about new materials, it doesn’t seem like any of them are used widely enough to replace plastic. I think we’ll have to wait and see whether new material can actually replace plastic.)</p></li>
