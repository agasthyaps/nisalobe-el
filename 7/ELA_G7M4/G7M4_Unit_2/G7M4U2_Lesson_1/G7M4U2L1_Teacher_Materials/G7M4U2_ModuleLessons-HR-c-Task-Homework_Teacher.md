(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Review the anchor text *Trash Vortex* for solutions to plastic pollution at the beginning of the plastic life cycle. Record your findings on the lines below.

**(Lesson 1 Homework)**

Solutions for Plastic Pollution at the Beginning of the Plastic Life Cycle

Answers will vary, but may include: On page 24, the author writes that the “federal Clean Water Act added strict rules” about placing industrial plants near water. This shows how government action can help reduce pollution of all kinds. On page 51, the author writes that “more than 200 U.S. cities have banned plastic bags.” This also shows how governments and communities can target plastic pollution before plastic is made and sold.

Solutions for Plastic Pollution in the Middle of the Plastic Life Cycle

Answers will vary, but may include: The author explains on pages 22–23 how “Plentiful and affordable plastics helped shape a new lifestyle.” But this also came with a new danger, since people were quicker to throw plastics away rather than washing them or reusing them. The author talks about how people were “drinking coffee from foam cups instead of ceramic ones” (23). But on page 50 the author also talks about how “every day people fight the war on plastic pollution. They drink from refillable water bottles and take cloth bags to fill at the grocery store” (50–51). These show clear examples of people fighting plastic pollution at the middle of its life cycle.

Solutions for Plastic Pollution at the End of the Plastic Life Cycle

Answers will vary, but may include: As one marine biologist explains in *Trash Vortex*, “Human litter is present in all marine habitats, from beaches to the most remote and deepest parts of the ocean” (44). This means that the problem already exists in the ocean, and to fix it, we will need to start cleaning up plastic: “Could a vacuum cleaner suck up the plastic from the ocean surface?” (45) “Scientists have discovered . . . that among nature’s army of decomposers, some can almost miraculously biodegrade plastic” (46).
