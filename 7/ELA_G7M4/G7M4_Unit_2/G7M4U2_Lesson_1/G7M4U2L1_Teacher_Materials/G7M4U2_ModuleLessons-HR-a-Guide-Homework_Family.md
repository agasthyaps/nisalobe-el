Where and how does plastic pollute?

- *Plastic pollutes our world (especially our oceans) when people dispose of it incorrectly.*

- *Plastic pollution travels from land to the ocean and is taken by the currents in a big vortex called the North Pacific Gyre.*

- *Animals and people are being harmed by plastic pollution.*

- *Plastic entered our world in the 1950s, and, through marketing and lifestyle, has become ubiquitous.*

What can be done about plastic pollution? What is being done? What can I do?

- *There are three main points in the life cycle of plastic: the beginning (making plastic), the middle (buying and using plastic), the end (disposing of plastic).*

- *People try to combat plastic pollution with different solutions at these three points in the plastic life cycle.*

- *People who combat plastic pollution use their skills and learning to help others and to improve their environment and our world.*

What will your student be doing at school?

In Unit 2, students continue to explore the problem of plastic pollution by focusing on what can be done to address the problem. Students read three articles and revisit their anchor texts (*Trash Vortex* and the film *A Plastic Ocean*) to understand what steps can be taken at each stage of the plastic life cycle: beginning, middle, and end. Students learn about solutions for plastic pollution from the three different points of the plastic life cycle:

- New materials being invented to replace plastic in the beginning of the life cycle

- What consumers can do to use less plastic in the middle of the life cycle

- Efforts by governments and organizations to stop single-use plastic and invent ways of cleaning up plastic pollution in the end of the plastic life cycle

With the first two articles, students practice analyzing how authors develop their points of view. For example, authors might use words or phrases that show they approve of a solution to the plastic pollution problem. Students also analyze the articles for how different authors writing about the same topic present information differently. For example, one article discusses new materials that could replace plastic and another article talks about what consumers can do to use less plastic. Students compare these articles to passages from their anchor text *Trash Vortex* to see how different authors discuss the same information. For their mid-unit assessment, students read a new article and answer questions to show their understanding of point of view and how authors present information. Students also develop their vocabulary skills by learning to use relationships between words to find the meaning of unfamiliar words. For example, students will use synonyms (words with similar meanings), antonyms (words with opposite meanings), and analogies (comparisons) to find the meanings of new words. As students analyze these articles, they also practice debating which part of the plastic life cycle is the best place to reduce plastic pollution. By the middle of the unit, students take a stand about which part of the plastic life cycle would be most effective to target. For example, students could argue that the end of the plastic life cycle is the best place to focus on since it is where people can clean up plastic. Another group may argue that the beginning of the plastic life cycle is best to target because governments can prevent single use plastics being made in the first place. Students then have the opportunity to defend their position in a debate with their classmates.

In the second half of the unit, students use the evidence and reasoning they’ve collected and organized from their reading to practice argument essay writing about which place in the plastic life cycle is the best place to target to reduce pollution. This will be the same topic students were debating in groups, but they will now have the opportunity to write their thoughts in a formal essay. Students work first as pairs to plan, draft, and revise argument essays before following the same routine for independent writing. Students practice writing clear sentences with descriptive or modifying phrases that are placed correctly in a sentence. Students also practice using a comma to separate coordinate adjectives or words that describe the same noun. By the end of the unit, students will have strengthened their arguments about which part of the plastic life cycle they think would be the most effective place to intervene.

Central to the EL Education curriculum is a focus on “habits of character” and social-emotional learning. Students work to become effective learners, developing mindsets and skills for success in college, career, and life (e.g., initiative, responsibility, perseverance, collaboration); work to become ethical people, treating others well and standing up for what is right (e.g., empathy, integrity, respect, compassion); and work to contribute to a better world, putting their learning to use to improve communities (e.g., citizenship, service).

In this unit, students focus on working to become effective learners as they persevere to analyze author’s point of view and purpose in complex texts. They also take responsibility and initiative as they collaborate in discussions and during group analysis work. Students focus on working to become ethical people by showing empathy and compassion for the people and animals they read about that threatened by pollution. As they explore the articles in this unit, students witness the habits of character that are exhibited by the inventors, scientists, and authors as they contribute to making the world a better place in numerous ways. The writers of the articles contribute to a better world by informing the public about the problem of plastic pollution, inspiring environmental action, and sharing their knowledge in order to improve their shared spaces and environment. The inventors and scientists mentioned in the articles demonstrate other habits of character such as taking initiative in inventing new materials, collaborating with each other to try and improve the oceans, and persevering through trying new ways of cleaning up the ocean.

How can you support your student at home?

Notice plastic waste in your home and plastic pollution in your neighborhood. Visit local waterways and/or storm drains to find signs of plastic pollution.

Explore with your student issues around plastic pollution. Read articles, nonfiction texts, and watch documentary films related to plastic pollution at various points during the plastic life cycle:

- Beginning: Finding alternatives to plastic

- Middle: Recycling or reusing plastic

- End: Cleaning up plastic pollution

View debates online and discuss with your student the expectations around the debate they will be taking part in. Review the following terms:

- Presenting Position: The beginning of a debate, where a member of the team presents their team’s position in the debate, explaining reasons and evidence for their claims.

- Cross Examination: The section of the debate where members of other teams are allowed to ask questions about the presenting team’s position.

- Rebuttal and Summary: The end of the debate, when the team restates their positions and addresses counterarguments and any issues raised during cross examination.

You may use questions such as the following for your conversations:

- What is the author’s point of view in the text? How does the author distinguish his or her position from that of others?

- How do two different authors write about the same topic differently?

- What do you think should be done about the problem of plastic pollution?

- Where should we focus our energy to stop plastic pollution?

- How can we help with the problem of plastic pollution in our own house, neighborhood, or community?

**Unit 2: Homework**

In Lessons 1 and 3, students practice using relationships between words, such as synonyms (words with similar meanings), antonyms (words with opposite meanings), and analogies (comparisons), to find the meaning of words.

In Lessons 1–4, students do research in their anchor text *Trash Vortex* to find examples of solutions to plastic pollution at the beginning of the plastic life cycle.

In Lesson 2, students reread articles to prepare to compare the articles, focusing on how the authors present their evidence.

In Lesson 4, students prepare for their debates by writing an opening statement, drafting cross-examination questions, considering counter-claims as a responder, or drafting a summary.

In Lessons 7 and 8, students create sentences from phrases without using misplaced or dangling modifiers.

In Lessons 9–13, students use commas to separate coordinate adjectives in sentences from the module texts.

In Lesson 11, students reread their note-catchers and texts to prepare for their end of unit assessment in the next lesson.

In Lessons 14–15, students reflect on their improvement over the course of the writing process from planning to writing to revision. Students also set goals for future writing.

In Lessons 4–15, students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their independent reading journal.

Independent Research Reading: When not reading the anchor text, your student is expected to independently research the topic by reading topic-related books of his or her choice for approximately 20 minutes each day and responding to a prompt of choice in the front of the independent reading journal. These are usually books your student will bring home from school; however, they may be topic-related books chosen by the student at the public or your home library. Prompts for independent reading can be found in the homework materials provided below.

Independent Reading

**Directions:** Remember to record responses to research reading in the front of your independent reading journal and responses to choice reading in the back. Try to choose a different prompt each time.

Record any new vocabulary in your vocabulary log. Underline vocabulary found during independent reading.

**Record:**

- Date

- Title and author of your reading book

- Pages you have read

- Prompt

- Response

**Example:**

<u>Date:</u> 03/01/19

<u>Book Title and Author:</u> *Trash Vortex* by Danielle Smith-Llera

<u>Pages Read:</u> 26–37

<u>Prompt:</u> What is the author’s point of view in the text? How does the author distinguish his or her position from that of others?

<u>Response:</u> The author’s point of view is that plastic is a huge problem. In this chapter, she distinguishes her own point of view from the point of view of most Americans in the 1950s and 1960s, which was that plastic is useful, beneficial, and disposable.

**  
Consider using the following independent reading prompts.**[^1]

- What are the central ideas in the text and how are they developed?

- What is the author’s purpose and how is it developed?

- What is the author’s point of view in the text? How does the author distinguish his or her position from that of others?

- Where and how does plastic pollute?

- What can be done about plastic pollution? What is being done about plastic pollution?

- Choose one new word from your reading today and analyze it on a vocabulary square.

| **Definition in your own words**                  | **Synonyms** (words with the same meaning) |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Words with the same affix or root**             | **Sketch**                                 |
| **Translation in home language** (if appropriate) |                                            |

**Vocabulary**

**Directions:** In the classroom, you have been recording words from your texts in your vocabulary log. Throughout this unit, you have been research reading topic-related books at home to build your knowledge of plastic pollution and recording words in your independent reading journal.

Choose a word from your research reading or from a text you’ve read in class and add the word to your vocabulary log. Try to choose a different word to add and to practice a different vocabulary strategy each time. For each word, be sure to add the following:

1.  The definition, or meaning, of the word

<!-- -->

13. The vocabulary strategy you used to figure out the meaning of the word

14. A sketch or diagram that helps you to better understand the meaning of the word

Record new vocabulary in vocabulary logs and mark academic vocabulary with a symbol, for example, a star:

- Academic vocabulary: words you might find in informational texts on many different topics. For example, the words **evidence** and **rationale** are words that could be found in books on any topic.

- Domain-specific vocabulary: words about a particular topic. For example, the words **tadpoles**, **frogspawn**, and **amphibian** are some that would be found on the topic of frogs.

**Vocabulary Strategies**

As a reminder, the vocabulary strategies we’ve been working on in class are listed below:

- Context: Read the sentence around the word.

- Look at the affixes for clues.

- Look at the root of the word for clues.

- Use a dictionary.

- Discuss the word with another person (after attempting some of the above strategies).

[^1]: Some of the prompts will not be appropriate for the text students are reading. Invite students to choose a prompt that works for the text they have just read.
