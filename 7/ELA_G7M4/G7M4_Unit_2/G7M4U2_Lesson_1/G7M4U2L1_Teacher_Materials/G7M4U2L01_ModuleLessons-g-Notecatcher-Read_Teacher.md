<th><p>Culminating Task:</p>
<p>This article falls into the beginning of the plastic life cycle because <strong>it gives examples of new materials that could replace plastic.</strong> So these examples would be used before the plastic is created. The author presents interesting ideas about new materials, <strong>but it doesn’t seem like any of them are used widely enough to replace plastic.</strong> I think <strong>we’ll have to wait and see whether new materials can actually replace plastic.</strong></p></th>
