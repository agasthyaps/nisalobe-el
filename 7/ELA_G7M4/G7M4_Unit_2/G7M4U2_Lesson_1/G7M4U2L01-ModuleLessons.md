Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.7.1 – Opening A: On an entrance ticket, students grapple with the concept of the plastic life cycle, brainstorming ideas for what can be done and who should take action to reduce plastic pollution at the beginning of the plastic life cycle.

- RI.7.6 – Work Time A: Students closely read the article “Five Weird Materials That Could Replace Plastic,” analyzing it for the author’s purpose and point of view.

- SL.7.3 – Closing and Assessment A: Students are introduced to a debate preparation routine by analyzing a model spoken argument. The debate preparation routine will be used throughout the unit to deepen knowledge of the different stages of the plastic life cycle and to provide context for choosing one stage as a focus for the performance task.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners by engaging in a close read and answering questions in small groups.

- The Think-Pair-Share protocol is used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- In the article read in this lesson, different inventors demonstrate perseverance and initiative as they try to create new materials to replace plastic and reduce plastic pollution.

- Over the course of the first half of Unit 2, students will engage in activities that will prepare them to conduct a formal debate about which part of the plastic life cycle to target to best reduce plastic pollution. The following is the arc of the debate-preparation activities:

- **Lesson 1**: Model presenting the position that the beginning of the plastic life cycle is the most effective place to target interventions. As a class, students use cross-examination to ask questions about the position.

- **Lesson 2**: Students choose to support targeting either the beginning or middle of the plastic life cycle for debating practice. Those who choose the middle part of the cycle practice presenting their position and responding to cross-examination questions. Those who choose the beginning practice asking cross-examination questions.

- **Lesson 3**: Students choose either the beginning or middle of the plastic life cycle and practice delivering a summary and a rebuttal for their position.

- **Lesson 4**: Students work in groups of four to practice participating in a full debate about whether to target pollution at the end of the plastic life cycle. They assume roles and practice either presenting the position, asking cross-examination questions, responding to cross examination questions or summarizing.

- **Lessons 5–6**: Students engage in a formal debate, choosing their position (beginning, middle, or end of the plastic life cycle) and role (position presenter, cross-examiner, responder, or summarizer).

- These activities are designed to deepen students’ understanding of all three positions and provide some experience with the different roles in a debate.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Students who are ready for an additional challenge can research to find more articles on solutions for fighting plastic pollution at the beginning of the life cycle. They can present this information in a poster, slideshow, or film clip.

- Allow those students who demonstrate greater ease understanding the text to move on to outlining different possible solutions at the middle of the plastic life cycle, using *Trash Vortex* as a resource in addition to the article.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students have built background knowledge about plastic pollution by reading and viewing their anchor texts. In this lesson, students begin engaging more deeply with possible solutions to the problem of plastic pollution by reading an article focused on solutions at the beginning of the plastic life cycle.

Support All Students

- Students may need additional support with basic comprehension as the article is read aloud during the close read. If so, pause at the end of each paragraph and allow time for students to highlight key ideas, take notes on the gist, and even record sketches in the margins of the article. ▲

- Students may also need support understanding the scientific terms in the article. If so, ask students to identify the terms by circling them. Then work as a class to use strategies (including context, affixes, and a dictionary) to define them. ▲

- Note there is a differentiated version of the Close Read: “Five Weird Materials That Could Replace Plastic” note-catcher used in Work Time A in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- The subject matter in this excerpt includes descriptions of plastic covering the Earth and damaging the environment. Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this chapter that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually. To support students in processing this content, ask: “What habit of character did you use as you read and discussed this excerpt?” Students may need to draw on perseverance, empathy, and compassion as they read and discuss this content, being sensitive to their own and others’ reactions to the information presented.

- To support ELLs, this lesson provides students the opportunity to work with teacher and peer guidance in a close read of Jessica Hullinger’s “Five Weird Materials That Could Replace Plastic.”

- ELLs may find it challenging to understand the domain-specific vocabulary in the article. In addition to the supports suggested in the lesson and below, work with students in a group to highlight and use strategies to determine the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, 7.I.B.6, and 7.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Close Read: “Five Weird Materials That Could Replace Plastic” note-catchers to ensure understanding of how the author develops the point of view in the article.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will read an article proposing solutions for plastic pollution at the middle of the plastic life cycle. Students will continue to gather information and insights about what can be done at each stage of the plastic life cycle in order to make an informed decision about which part of the cycle they’d like to focus on for their performance task.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.7.1 (10 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 1**.

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use the vocabulary strategies on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart** to deconstruct the words *plastic life cycle* (the full process by which plastic is produced, used, and discarded). Record the term on the **domain-specific word wall** with translations in home languages, where appropriate, and invite students to record term in their **vocabulary logs**.

- Inform students that throughout this unit they will analyze texts and plan and write essays about different ways to reduce plastic pollution at the different stages of the plastic life cycle. Display the **Plastic Life Cycle anchor chart**, drawing and focusing students’ attention on a circular image to represent the beginning, middle, and end of the plastic life cycle. Refer to the **Plastic Life Cycle anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Inform students that for this unit and the rest of the module they will be thinking about the plastic life cycle in terms of what can be done to reduce plastic pollution and who has the power to make changes at different parts of the life cycle. Ask student volunteers to share their responses from their entrance tickets about their ideas about how they would describe the beginning of the plastic life cycle, who has the power to make changes, and what those changes could be.

- Conduct a whole-class discussion about the different parts of the plastic life cycle. To guide the discussion ask the following:

“How would you describe the beginning of the plastic life cycle?” (The beginning of the plastic life cycle is when plastic is getting made or even before it is made.)

“From your reading and viewing so far, who has the most power over reducing plastic pollution at the beginning of its life cycle, before it is even made?” (Companies who make plastic affect the production at the beginning of its life cycle. Governments and communities also have the power to make plastic illegal.)

“What solutions are there for reducing plastic pollution at the beginning of the plastic life cycle?” (The companies that make plastic can produce a different material at the beginning of the life cycle. Governments and communities can also ban plastic at the beginning of its life cycle.)

- On the Plastic Life Cycle anchor chart, record student responses for ways to reduce plastic pollution at the beginning of the plastic life cycle.

- Confirm for students that at the beginning, the people who have the power to make change are the companies that make the plastic or the communities and governments that have the power to ban it. Explain to students that as they examine the different solutions available at each part of the life cycle, they will encounter some solutions that overlap for different parts of the life cycle. For example, recycling can happen at the middle of the life cycle or the end. In thinking of ways to reduce plastic pollution, however, students will primarily focus on who has the most power at each part of the plastic life cycle. Tell students that today they will be reading an article to look more closely at the solutions available at the beginning of the plastic life cycle.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

- For the entrance ticket in Opening A, encourage students to work independently at first to highlight key words and phrases in the excerpt and grapple to answer the questions. Direct them to share their highlights and responses with a partner to check and expand their work. Grappling first and then working with a partner will increase student engagement, independence, and speaking and listening skills.

For Heavier Support

- For the entrance ticket in Opening A, encourage students to work in pairs to highlight key words and phrases in the excerpt and to answer the questions. Pair students by either content or language proficiency. Strategic grouping affords students the opportunity of supporting and being challenged by others.

Work Time

A. Close Read: “Five Weird Materials That Could Replace Plastic” – RI.7.6 (25 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify the central ideas in an article about the beginning of the plastic life cycle.”

“I can identify the point of view in an article about the beginning of the plastic life cycle.”

- Focus students on the Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart and remind them that digging into the text deeper can help them understand it better, so they are going to dig deeper into an excerpt of the text through close reading.

- Move students into predetermined triads.

- Direct students’ attention to the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**, and review what collaboration looks and sounds like.

- Use **Close Reading Guide: “Five Weird Materials That Could Replace Plastic”** to set the purpose of the close read and to guide students through a close read of this excerpt. Refer to the guide for how to integrate the following:

- **Text: “Five Weird Materials That Could Replace Plastic”**

- **Close Read: “Five Weird Materials That Could Replace Plastic” Note-catcher**

- **Close Read: “Five Weird Materials That Could Replace Plastic” Note-catcher** ▲ as necessary. The differentiated note-catcher supports students’ writing and comprehension with sentence frames. ▲

- Refer to **Close Read: “Five Weird Materials That Could Replace Plastic” Note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Once students have finished reading and analyzing the article, ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What habits of character did you see in this article? Who demonstrated them? What did they look/sound like?” (Possible response: Different inventors demonstrate perseverance and initiative as they try to create new materials to replace plastic and reduce plastic pollution.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- Some students may have familiarity with materials that can replace plastic. If so, before Work Time A, ask them to share their experiences with their classmates. As necessary, prompt these students with questions such as the following:

- What are some materials that can be used instead of plastic? What are the pros and cons (positives and negatives) of these materials? Have you ever used a plastic alternative? What was it like?

- Asset-based instruction increases students’ confidence and engagement with the topic of materials to replace plastic pollution.

- During the first reading of the article in Work Time A, pause after reading each paragraph to allow time for students to highlight key information and jot down a gist. If they are unable to understand a paragraph enough to record a gist, they should Turn and Talk with a partner to figure out the gist together. Taking time to record gists will ensure comprehension.

- Also in Work Time A, ensure that students are strategically grouped to best support them. This may mean mixed groupings by language or content proficiency. However, ensure that there is no more than one level of difference among the students in a group. Strategic grouping affords students the opportunity of supporting and being challenged by others.

For Heavier Support

- As in the lighter support, some students may have familiarity with materials that can replace plastic. If so, before Work Time A, ask them to share their experiences with their classmates. If students don’t feel comfortable sharing their experiences with their classmates, they can draw or write about them. They can also share with a partner or with the teacher who can share with the class. Asset-based instruction increases students’ confidence and engagement with the topic of materials to replace plastic pollution.

- During the first reading of the article in Work Time A, to support students, draw together a group of students who need heavier support and read aloud the article, pausing at the end of each paragraph for students to Turn and Talk to tell the gist, highlight keywords and phrases, and even illustrate the text in the margins. Review students’ gists, highlights, and illustrations before moving on to the next paragraph. Taking time to record gists and highlight the text will ensure comprehension.

- As in the lighter support, for Work Time A, ensure that students are strategically grouped to best support them. In addition to the lighter supports, group students who need heavier support by home language and encouraging them to use their home language in their discussions and written responses if necessary.

- During Work Time A, invite students to use the **Close Read: “Five Weird Materials That Could Replace Plastic” note-catcher** ▲. This resource features sample responses which support students with comprehension and writing.

Closing and Assessment

A. Introduction to Plastic Life Cycle Debate – SL.7.3 (10 minutes)

- Explain to students that throughout this unit they will discuss and informally debate which part of the plastic life cycle is the best to target in order to reduce plastic pollution. They will work in groups to take turns defending different parts of the life cycle and also ask questions of groups defending other parts of the life cycle. After they have practiced different roles and positions in the debate for several lessons, they will choose which position they would like to formally defend as well as what role they would like to play in a formal debate in Lessons 5–6.

- Explain to students that in the formal debate in Lessons 5–6, they will be responsible for convincing an advertising agency to design a commercial about plastic pollution. The advertising agency would like to choose a particular part of the plastic life cycle on which to focus an ad designed to reduce plastic pollution. The agency will use this debate to help them decide how to proceed with the commercial.

- Display the **Debate Steps anchor chart**. Ask students to Turn and Talk to define *debate* (a discussion about the different sides of a subject or issue) and *cross-examine* (to question thoroughly and insistently, often for the purpose of comparing responses with those of earlier questioning). Use a total participation technique to review student responses and record the words on the domain-specific word wall with translations in home languages, where appropriate, and invite students to record term in their vocabulary logs. At this time, students can also review the definition of *position* from Module 4, Unit 1 (point of view, opinion).

- Review the Present the Position and Cross-Examine steps, explaining that for this first lesson, students will watch as the Present the Position step is modeled for the beginning of the plastic life cycle. Then they will work as a class to cross-examine. Distribute the **Beginning of Debate Note-catcher**, and review that in the top portion of the note-catcher, students should take notes on the model presentation of the beginning position. Then in the “Cross-Examine” section of the note-catcher, students will record questions to ask about the model presentation. Explain that students will fill out the bottom of the note-catcher in a later lesson.

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share to grapple about what kinds of questions they can ask to cross-examine or question someone defending the beginning of the plastic life cycle as the best place to reduce plastic pollution. Record the questions on the board for students to use:

- “You mentioned \_\_\_\_. Why do you think that is the most helpful solution?”

- “You mentioned \_\_\_\_, but what about \_\_\_\_?”

- “What other evidence do you have to support your case?”

- “Can you say more about . . . ?”

- Record some possible questions on the Debate Steps anchor chart. Present the position, consulting the **Beginning of Debate Note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** for suggested statements and points. Then guide students to cross-examine you as a class.

- Before students leave class, ensure they have a copy of **Homework: Understand Word Relationships: “Five Weird Materials That Could Replace Plastic**.” Explain that authors often use synonyms, antonyms, and analogies to help readers understand word meanings. Ask students to Turn and Talk and use strategies to determine the meaning of *synonyms* (words that have similar meanings), *antonyms* (words that have opposite meanings), and *analogies* (comparing two things based on similar features). Record these words on the domain-specific word wall with translations in home languages, where appropriate, and invite students to record them in their vocabulary logs.

- Model completing the first item, using a Think Aloud such as:

“I know the meaning of *molded*, so I can use it to help me understanding *malleable*. Things that are malleable can be molded, so malleable must mean able to be molded.”

- As necessary, allow students time to work in pairs to complete an additional item.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- To support students in understanding the teacher modeling of presenting a position in a debate, be sure to speak slowly, pausing at the end of each sentence. Also, consider using the Plastic Life Cycle anchor chart as a visual to which students can refer to increase their oral comprehension.

For Heavier Support

- To support students in understanding the teacher modeling of presenting a position in a debate, provide students with a copy of the Beginning of Debate note-catcher (example for teacher reference). Students can preread the beginning debate position notes, discuss them in pairs for comprehension, and then follow along as the position is modeled to them. Use the Plastic Life Cycle anchor chart or sketching quick images as visuals to which students can refer to increase their oral comprehension.

Homework

A. Understand Word Relationships

- Students complete Homework: Understand Word Relationships: “Five Weird Materials That Could Replace Plastic” to better understand the meanings of words in the article.

B. Find Solutions

- Students complete the first part of **Homework: Find Solutions** by doing research in their anchor text, *Trash Vortex*, to find examples of solutions to plastic pollution at the beginning of the plastic life cycle.

For Lighter Support

- Before students leave class, ask them to read the homework assignments and discuss them with a partner. Allow time for students to work with a partner to answer the first item together to make sure they can complete the homework independently.

For Heavier Support

- Before students leave class, review the homework assignments and ensure that students understand how to use the relationships between words to understand them better. Work together with students to complete the first item, then challenge them to complete the second item with a partner to make sure they can complete the homework independently.
