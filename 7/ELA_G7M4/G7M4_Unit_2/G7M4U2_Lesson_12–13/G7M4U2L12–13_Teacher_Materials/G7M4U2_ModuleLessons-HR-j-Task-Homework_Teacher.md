Homework: Coordinate Adjectives QuickWrite

(Example for Teacher Reference)

In Language Dives throughout the modules, you have learned about adjectives. Remember that adjectives are describing words. Coordinate adjectives modify the same noun.

For example: If an **innovative, workable** solution like Pyrogenesis is not implemented in places like Tuvalu, the quality of life will continue to decline. (*A Plastic Ocean*)

(The coordinate adjectives **innovative** and **workable** modify the noun **solution**.)

You will use coordinate adjectives in your own argument writing to elaborate on your topic.

**Directions:** Write a QuickWrite describing your feelings about plastic pollution. Include coordinate adjectives separated by commas. Underline the coordinate adjectives you include.

Answers will vary, but may include:

I used to think that plastic pollution was located in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch or in developing countries. Now I realize that it’s absolutely everywhere, and it’s choking our waterways and our oceans. If we don’t get a handle on this problem, and quickly, our once <u>beautiful, natural</u> Earth will suffer. Small islands like Tuvalu will become <u>uninhabitable, dangerous</u> places and the people will suffer. The animals will also suffer. Plastic pollution is a really big problem that requires <u>innovative, global</u> solutions.
