**Prompt:** Write an essay defending the idea that the middle of the plastic life cycle is the best place to target to reduce plastic pollution.

Open it, peel it, tie it, toss it—plastic might seem cheap, but throwing it away comes at a cost. Plastic that is not thrown away properly pollutes our oceans and our lands. It can harm sea creatures who swallow it by accident. And eventually, we end up eating harmful chemicals that latch on to the plastic. (Smith-Llera 40) We must take action to reduce plastic pollution. People have tried to create new materials to replace plastic at the beginning of the plastic life cycle, or proposed cleanup efforts at the end of the life cycle. These efforts are helpful, but the most effective place to reduce plastic pollution is at the middle of its life cycle. By buying other materials as much as possible and recycling the plastic we do use, we can help ensure a future that is free of plastic pollution.

We have the power to use less plastic. We just need to start making better choices. There are many things we use plastic for that can be replaced by other alternatives. Anjali Acharya, writing for the World Bank, gives five examples of how consumers can use less plastic. For example, she explains that people buy “an estimated million plastic bottles per minute” (Acharya). Avoiding this plastic is as easy as making sure you have other ways of drinking water. Also, we can make similar choices for all kinds of plastic items. There are many alternatives to plastic bags, plastic straws, and plastic cutlery that do not hurt the environment. These are just a few examples that show that we have the power to make better choices. The many choices we can make to buy and use less plastic show that focusing on reducing plastic pollution at the middle of its life cycle can be extremely effective.

Another way that we can target plastic pollution at the middle of its life cycle is by recycling it. Recycling programs are already popular and sometimes even profitable. As Roger Morton says in the documentary *A Plastic Ocean*, recycled plastic can be used to make money. In *Trash Vortex*, Jason Farahnik, a project manager at a recycling facility, explains that the plastic in landfills makes them “goldmines, full of resources” (Smith-Llera 49). Some may argue that recycling programs do not significantly reduce plastic pollution. However, these examples show that recycling can work and it pays. Ecologist Chris Wilcox believes that getting people to recycle more plastic is “the cheapest, simplest, and far most efficient solution” to the plastic pollution problem (Smith-Llera 52). The success of recycling efforts around the world demonstrates that targeting plastic pollution in the middle of its life cycle can work.

W.7.1c: Uses phrases like “Another way that we can target . . . ” to clarify the relationship between ideas.

W.7.9b: Draws evidence from informational texts to support analysis.

W.7.1e: Provides a conclusion that follows from and supports the argument.

The problem of plastic pollution is one of the most urgent that we face. As Smith-Llera writes in *Trash Vortex*, “\[e\]very day people fight the war on plastic pollution.” But in this fight, we have to make a choice about how to best spend our energy. Some argue that the beginning of the life cycle, before plastic is made, is best. Others say we should fight plastic where it already is by cleaning it up. These efforts are important, but the best place to focus is at the middle of the life cycle. Plastic keeps getting made because we use it and don’t recycle it enough. If we make new, better choices, we can solve this problem right from the middle.
