Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.7.1 – Closing and Assessment A: Students track progress on their ability to write an argument, focusing on including evidence to support points and writing an effective conclusion.

- In Work Time A, students independently write an argument essay for Part I of their End of Unit 2 Assessment, being sure to clearly introduce and support their claim with well-organized reasons and relevant evidence. Students also use transitional words and phrases to clarify relationships between ideas, maintain a formal style, and provide a conclusion that follows from the rest of the essay. (W.7.1, W.7.5, W.7.6, W.7.9b, W.7.10)

- Two lessons have been allocated for this assessment to ensure sufficient time for students to write an argument essay. If these are taught in two separate lessons rather than together as one block, revisit the learning targets and the task at the beginning of the second 45-minute lesson to remind students of the task and purpose.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners and ethical people by practicing integrity and perseverance as they independently write an essay for the end of unit assessment. They will also practice taking responsibility as they track their progress on writing skills.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Encourage those students who finish the assessment early to begin tracking their progress and revising or adding to their essays to meet their argument writing goals.

- Invite students to trade assessments with a peer who is also done early and assess their peer’s essay using the checklist, providing stars and steps.

- Invite students to read their essays aloud, noticing where further editing and revisions are needed.

- Encourage students to go on a coordinate adjective hunt, finding examples of coordinate adjectives from texts in the classroom library or on the internet and creating a poster, presentation, or project of their choosing showing what they learned.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In Unit 2, students have been closely examining articles about solutions for plastic pollution at different points in the plastic life cycle. This prepares students for this end of unit assessment, in which they write an argument essay defending their claim to address plastic pollution in the middle of the plastic life cycle. Over the past several lessons, students worked in pairs to refine the skills related to writing an argument essay, so they are prepared to independently write the essay in this lesson.

Support All Students

- Note there is a differentiated version of the Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer used in Work Time A in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment. ▲

- Some students may require more than the time allotted to complete the assessment. ▲

- Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this lesson that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually.

- To support ELLs, the assessment in this lesson consists of writing an essay using the same graphic organizer and process that students used throughout the unit. This gradual release supports students in independently completing the task successfully.

- ELLs may find it challenging to plan and write an essay independently. In addition to the supports below, some students might benefit from a shorter assignment, writing a paragraph or a shorter essay. Beginning ELLs can apply the same introduction, proof, and conclusion structure to a paragraph response. Doing so will allow them to demonstrate their writing and analysis skills while making the task achievable.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, 7.I.B.7, 7.I.B.8, 7.I.C.11, 7.I.C.12, 7.II.A.1, 7.II.A.2, 7.II.B.3, 7.II.B.4, 7.II.C.6, and 7.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- Assessment materials (student copy, annotated student exemplar, and teacher rubric) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback to students on this assessment, use the Grade 7 Argument Writing Rubric located in the Module 1 Teacher Guide: Appendix and on the Tools Page (https://eled.org/tools), and the annotated sample essay (see Assessment Overview and Resources) to help complete students’ Track Progress recording forms. Make notes in the appropriate column for each criterion in a different color from student responses. There is also space to respond to student comments.

- In this assessment, students are tracking progress toward the following anchor standard:

- W.1: By the end of Grade 12 I will be able to: Write arguments to support claims in an analysis of substantive topics or texts using valid reasoning and relevant and sufficient evidence.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will engage in a peer critique of each other’s essays, focusing on using phrases that modify ideas and commas between coordinate adjectives. Students will then have an opportunity to incorporate their peers’ feedback.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Return **Mid-Unit 2 Assessments with feedback**, and allow students time to review feedback and write their name on the board if they require support.

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lessons 12–13**. Students choose whether to share their goals for this assessment with a partner or the class.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. End of Unit 2 Assessment, Part I: Write an Argument Essay (75 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target:

“I can plan and write an argument essay about addressing plastic pollution in the middle of the plastic life cycle.”

- Invite students to retrieve the following materials:

- **Argument Writing checklist**

- **Note-catchers** from Module 4, Units 1 and 2

- **Texts from Module 4, Units 1 and 2**: *A Plastic Ocean*, *Trash Vortex*, “Five Weird Materials That Could Replace Plastic,” “Five Things You Can Do to End Plastic Pollution,” and “Boyan Slat: The Great Pacific Garbage Patch Kid”

- Remind students that in this lesson they will complete their end of unit assessment by independently writing a complete argument essay to a new prompt about plastic pollution and they will revise the essay further in Lessons 14–15.

- Distribute a new blank copy of the **Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer** and the **Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer** ▲ to each student as necessary. The differentiated organizer supports students’ writing with sentence frames and simplified questions. ▲ Explain that students may use this graphic organizer, or one they create themselves, to plan the essay. The planner will not be scored; only the essay itself will be assessed.

- Distribute the **End of Unit 2 Assessment, Part I: Write an Argument Essay**.

- Read the prompt aloud as students follow along, reading silently. Ensure that students understand that they will be writing an essay defending the idea that the middle of the plastic life cycle is the best place to target to reduce plastic pollution. Answer clarifying questions.

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence. Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners** and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor charts** and review perseverance and integrity as necessary. Remind students that as they will be writing independently for the assessment, rather than working in pairs, they will practice perseverance and integrity.

- Invite students to begin the assessment.

- While students are taking the assessment, circulate to monitor and document their test-taking skills and to ensure students are on task and using the correct resources.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target and how well they practiced perseverance and integrity in this assessment.

For Lighter Support

- Before Work Time A, encourage students to join with a classmate who needs heavier support to review their note-catchers and texts from throughout the module. Doing so will ensure that they and their classmates have a firm grasp of the content for their essay.

- Before the end of unit assessment in Work Time A, challenge students to underline key vocabulary in the assessment directions and prompt as they are read aloud together as a class. Also, invite students to restate or clarify information for their classmates who need heavier support. These supports ensure that students understand each task included in the assessment.

For Heavier Support

- As in the lighter support, before Work Time A, encourage students to join with a classmate who needs lighter support to review their note-catchers and texts from throughout the module. Doing so will ensure that they have a firm grasp of the content for their essay.

- During Work Time A, invite students to use the Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer ▲. The sentence frames in this resource support students in planning their essay.

- In Work Time A, read the directions for the assessment slowly, twice, and also post them. This ensures that ELLs who may not be able to easily follow the language of the directions have multiple opportunities to access them.

- Display a “map” of the assessment to reference while explaining directions to the mid-unit assessment. This will reduce ambiguity and give students a clearer picture of what they can expect so that they can better allocate their time and attentional resources. Provide students with colored pencils or highlighters so that they can mark up the map as needed. Example:

- Write an essay in response to the prompt with

1.  an introduction paragraph (with a focus statement that tells the main claim or opinion),

2.  two Proof Paragraphs (with evidence—one for each point), and

3.  a conclusion paragraph (with a restatement of the focus and a reflection).

- Use the Argument Writing checklist to reread the essay to check that it says what you want it to say and there aren’t any errors in punctuation, spelling, or grammar.

Closing and Assessment

A. Track Progress – W.7.1 (10 minutes)

- Give students specific, positive feedback on their completion of Part I of the End of Unit 2 Assessment, for example: “I saw you persevering to find the best evidence in order to complete the whole essay. I saw you using integrity as you did your own work and focused on doing the best that you could do.”

- Distribute **Track Progress folders**, **Track Progress: Argument Writing**, and **sticky notes**.

- Explain that the sticky notes are for finding evidence of the following criteria:

- W.7.1b

- W.7.1e

- Guide students through completing the recording form.

Homework

A. Coordinate Adjectives QuickWrite

- Students complete **Homework: Coordinate Adjectives QuickWrite**, using commas to separate coordinate adjectives.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
