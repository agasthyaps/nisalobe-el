Homework: Coordinate Adjectives: Lesson 11

(Example for Teacher Reference)

In Language Dives throughout the modules, you have learned about adjectives. Remember that adjectives are describing words. Coordinate adjectives modify the same noun.

For example: If an **innovative, workable** solution like Pyrogenesis is not implemented in places like Tuvalu, the quality of life will continue to decline. (*A Plastic Ocean*)

(The coordinate adjectives **innovative** and **workable** modify the noun **solution**.)

You will use coordinate adjectives in your own argument writing to elaborate on your topic.

**Directions:** Read the model argument essay conclusion. Revise two or more sentences to include coordinate adjectives separated by a comma.

Answers will vary, but may include:

The problem of plastic pollution is one of the most <u>urgent, terrifying</u> problems that we face.

Some argue that the middle of the life cycle, where consumers make choices is the <u>best, wisest</u> place.
