Launch

Consider displaying the Language Dive sentence from the introduction paragraph of the Model Argument Essay in Module 4, Unit 2, Lesson 9 (**By inventing and using new materials and banning plastic as much as possible, we can help ensure a future that is free of plastic pollution**) and tell students that this Language Dive focuses on a reflection of this main claim.

After all,

Deconstruct

- Ask:

“What does the phrase after all mean? Can you figure out why the author uses the phrase after all to begin this sentence?” (After all is used to introduce an additional idea that supports or explains information just stated. The author uses this phrase to signal that the subsequent chunks will support the main claim of this essay, and invite us to think more deeply about it.)

- Invite students to review the previous sentence in the conclusion paragraph, which restates the main claim of the essay**: These efforts are important, but the most effective place to focus is at the beginning.** Students can discuss in pairs the additional idea they think the author will make about this claim. (Responses will vary, but may include: the author will provide an additional idea about why the beginning of the plastic life cycle is the most effective place for us to focus in order to reduce plastic pollution.)

how better to reduce plastic pollution than

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- **how better**

“What is another way to say how better? Can you figure out why the author uses the phrase how better to start this chunk?” (Another way to say how better is “what is a better or more effective way . . .”? The author uses this phrase to suggest there is no better or more effective way to do something than the idea that follows.)

- **to reduce plastic pollution:**

“No better way to do what?” (To reduce plastic pollution. The author is suggesting there is no better way to reduce plastic pollution than by the idea presented in the subsequent chunk.)

- **than**

“What does the word than tell us?” (Than is used to compare two or more things; it is used here to make the point that there is no better way to reduce plastic pollution than by doing what is mentioned in the next chunk.)

- Students can again review the previous sentence in the conclusion paragraph, which restates the main claim of the essay: **These efforts are important, but the most effective place to focus is at the beginning.** Then, invite students to predict the idea that follows. To support discussion, consider posing the following question: “What does the author think is a better way to reduce plastic pollution than anything else?”

- **Students can use Conversation Cues as they discuss. To provide heavier support, display a suggested sequence, such as the one below:**

- Can you say more about that? (Goal 1)

- Who can repeat what your classmate said? (Goal 2)

- Who can add on to what your classmate said? I’ll give you time to think. (Goal 4)

- How is what \_\_\_\_\_ said the same as/different from what \_\_\_\_\_ said? (Goal 4)

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Students can complete the following sentence frames to suggest the best way to show a certain habit of character.

**How better to show \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ than \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?**

habit of character infinitive verb phrase

(e.g., How better to show <u>compassion</u> than <u>to help comfort a friend in need</u>.) 

- To provide lighter support: Invite students to use coordinate adjectives as they complete the frame. (e.g., How better to show compassion than to help comfort a close, caring friend in need.)

- To provide heavier support: Provide a language bank with varying habits of character for students to choose from (e.g., hard work, perseverance, initiative, responsibility, determination).

to create less plastic in the first place?

Deconstruct

- Ask:

“What does the author think is a better way to reduce plastic pollution than anything else?” (Creating less plastic in the first place.)

“Can you say more about that?” (Responses will vary.)

- **in the first place**

“What’s another way to say in the first place?” (Another way to say in the first place is “initially; from the beginning.”)

- Students can discuss in pairs what we can do to create less plastic in the first place. Consider inviting students to refer to Points 1 and 2 of the essay as they do so. (Responses will vary, but may include: instead of creating plastic, we can invent and use new materials to take the place of plastic.)

After all, how better to reduce plastic pollution than to create less plastic in the first place?

Reconstruct

- **After all, <u>how better to reduce plastic pollution than</u> to create less plastic in the first place?**

“Can you figure out why the author poses this sentence as a question, rather than as a statement, such as: After all, there is no better way to reduce plastic pollution than to create less plastic in the first place?” (The author poses this sentence as a question to invite us to reflect on our own. While a statement can be a powerful way to relay information, a question can be a powerful way to encourage the reader to think more deeply about the information presented.)

“What is the relationship between our Language Dive sentence and the sentence that comes before it?” (Both this sentence and the previous one show thinking and reflecting following from the information presented in the essay.)

“What if we removed the phrase after all from this sentence? How would that change the meaning?” (If we removed the phrase after all from this sentence, it would still make sense. However, the connection between the previous information presented in the essay and this sentence would not be as strong; there would not be emphasis that this sentence makes a point supporting the information presented in the essay.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question:  
What can be done about plastic pollution? What is being done? What can I do?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice (Sentence)

- Students can use the following frame to write a reflection for their argument essay, that matches their lesson objective: **I can write the conclusion of my argument essay, restating the main claim and an opposing claim and adding a reflection.**

> **After all, how better to reduce plastic pollution than \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**
>
> **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?**
>

> emphasizing the most important stage to focus on in the plastic life cycle
>
>  (e.g., After all, how better to reduce plastic pollution than to <u>choose alternatives to using single-use plastic?</u>)
