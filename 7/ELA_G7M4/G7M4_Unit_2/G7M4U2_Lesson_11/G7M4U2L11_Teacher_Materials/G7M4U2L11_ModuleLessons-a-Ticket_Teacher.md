1.  “I’m off to visit the **tiny, isolated** coral atoll of Tuvalu in the South Pacific, near Fiji.” (*A Plastic Ocean* 1:5:28–1:5:32)

2.  “If an **innovative, workable** solution like Pyrogenesis is not implemented in places like Tuvalu, the quality of life will continue to decline.” (*A Plastic Ocean* 1:11:19–1:11:26)

3.  “They were always there: plastic shards, fluttering like lost moths in the surface waters of the **deep, remote** ocean.” (*Trash Vortex* 6)

4.  “A workable recipe for rubber did not end the search for **new, multipurpose** materials.” (*Trash Vortex* 17)
