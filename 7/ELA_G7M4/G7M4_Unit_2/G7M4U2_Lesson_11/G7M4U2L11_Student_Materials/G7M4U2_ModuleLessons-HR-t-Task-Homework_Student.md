Homework: Coordinate Adjectives: Lesson 11

**Name:** **Date:**

In Language Dives throughout the modules, you have learned about adjectives. Remember that adjectives are describing words. Coordinate adjectives modify the same noun.

For example: If an **innovative, workable** solution like Pyrogenesis is not implemented in places like Tuvalu, the quality of life will continue to decline. (*A Plastic Ocean*)

(The coordinate adjectives **innovative** and **workable** modify the noun **solution**.)

You will use coordinate adjectives in your own argument writing to elaborate on your topic.

**Directions:** Read the model argument essay conclusion. Revise two or more sentences to include coordinate adjectives separated by a comma.
