**Debate Question:** Which part of the plastic life cycle is the best place to target to reduce plastic pollution?

**Present the Position**

*Note to teacher: Possible answers listed in full sentences for use in presenting the position; student notes can be in incomplete sentences.*

Background

Plastic pollution has become an undeniable problem. According to Anjali Acharya from the World Bank, “plastic products wash up daily on beaches worldwide” and “waterways in cities are increasingly clogged with plastic waste.” Clearly, something needs to be done. There are many approaches to reducing plastic pollution. We can focus our energy on the beginning, middle, or end of the plastic life cycle. Each part is important.

Claim

If we are serious about solving the problem of plastic pollution, the simplest and most effective place to focus our energy is the middle of the life cycle.

Reason

At the middle of the life cycle, consumers, the people who buy and use plastic, have the power to reduce plastic pollution.

Evidence and Reasoning

There are many things consumers can do to reduce plastic. Anjali Acharya, writing for the World Bank, writes about five different things that consumers can do to reduce plastic waste. For example, to reduce the “1 million plastic bags used every minute,” Acharya writes that “you can set an example by bringing your own reusable bag when you shop.” A choice like that helps reduce the amount of plastic that ends up in the environment. Danielle Smith-Llera, in the book *Trash Vortex*, also provides evidence that consumers can have the biggest impact on plastic pollution at the middle of the cycle. “Every day people fight the war on plastic pollution, she writes. “They drink from refillable water bottles and take cloth bags to fill at the grocery store” (50–51). This shows that consumers are already motivated to make a change, and just need more encouragement.

Restated Claim

The middle of the plastic life cycle is the best place to reduce plastic pollution because consumers can make an impact themselves, and because they have so many ways to do it. By taking these steps, consumers can show that they are serious about improving our environment and reducing plastic pollution.

**Cross-Examination Questions**

Responses will vary, but may include:

1\. You mentioned \_\_\_\_; why do you think that is the most helpful solution?

2\. You mentioned \_\_\_\_, but what about \_\_\_\_?

3\. What other evidence do you have to support your case?

4\. Can you say more about \_\_\_\_?

**Rebuttal and Summary**

**Note to teacher: Completed in Lesson 3.**

Restated Claim

Although steps can be taken at the other parts of the plastic life cycle, the middle remains the most effective place to target.

Restated Evidence and Reason

We discussed how the middle of the plastic life cycle was the best place to make change because consumers had the power, and there were so many ways to make changes.

Counterclaim Acknowledgment

Other groups have brought up the objection that we may not be able to convince consumers to change their habits.

Refutation (New Evidence and Reasoning)

While it is true that persuading people to change is hard, consumers are easy to reach, through advertising or writing that explains the situation to them. It is less easy, for example, to persuade inventors or governments to change.

Restated Claim and Brief Reflection

Although others have raised interesting points, the middle of the plastic life cycle is still the best place to target to reduce plastic pollution. The best solution to this problem is to make sure that the people who use plastic the most make better decisions to protect our environment.
