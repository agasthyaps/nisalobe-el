The author uses imagery of “pristine beaches” and “happy turtles” to show what would happen if we got rid of plastic pollution. These images contrast with the first paragraph of the article, which describes a turtle getting sick from plastic and all the plastic products that “wash up daily on beaches worldwide.” By creating contrasting images, the author can try to turn hopelessness to hope.</strong></p></th>
