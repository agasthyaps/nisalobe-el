(For Teacher Reference)

**Purpose and Notes**

- The purpose of this close read is for students to trace the way the author develops her purpose and point of view.

- In this close read, students will focus only on the selected sections of the text, which are related to the author developing her purpose in the text.

- For the sake of time, first read aloud the text.

- After the text is first read aloud, students reread portions of the text as they answer text-dependent questions.

- A note-catcher along with text-dependent questions provide an opportunity for students to determine central ideas and the author’s purpose and point of view.

- Continue to use discussion protocols (e.g., Think-Pair-Share, Conversation Cues, and total participation techniques) to engage all students in collaborative discussion about the text.

<li><p>Explain that now you will look closely at sections of the text to better understand how the author develops her purpose in the text. Remind students of the work they did in the previous unit analyzing an author’s purpose and point of view, as well as in the previous lesson’s close read. For this close read, they will again analyze how an author uses language to make her position clear. Specifically, they’ll look at how the author takes other positions on the issue into account, and how that makes her own position more clear.</p></li>

<td>Reread the first paragraph.</td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Focus students on the first sentence: “The news headlines are grim.”</p></li>
<li><p>Ask:</p></li>
<li><p>“Why would the author choose to start an article this way?” (It creates an emotional response in the reader and makes them curious about what the headlines are.)</p></li>
<li><p>“How does the word <strong>grim</strong> clue you into the point of view of the article?” (The word <strong>grim</strong> lets you know that the point of view will be negative, at least at first.)</p></li>
<li><p>Focus students on the second sentence: “A male pilot whale dies on a<br />
Thai beach having swallowed 80 plastics bags; images of turtles stuck in six-pack plastic rings; a sad photo of a tiny seahorse clinging to a plastic<br />
ear-bud goes viral.”</p></li>
<li><p>Ask:</p></li>
<li><p>“Why does the author list facts about a whale, turtles, and a tiny seahorse?” (To provide evidence for the problem of plastic pollution.)</p></li>
<li><p>“How is this approach effective?” (It makes you feel sorry for the plight of the animals.)</p></li>
<li><p>Focus students on the third sentence: “Plastic products wash up daily on beaches worldwide—from Indonesia to coastal west Africa, and waterways in cities are increasingly clogged with plastic waste.”</p></li>
<li><p>Ask:</p></li>
<li><p>“How does the word <strong>clogged</strong> help to support the author’s point of view?” (It shows what a big problem plastic pollution has become.)</p></li>
<li><p>“Why does the author name specific beaches where plastic is being washed up?” (It helps to make the problem real and provide specific evidence to further the claim.)</p></li>
<li><p>Distribute and display the Close Read: “Five Things You Can Do to End Plastic Pollution” note-catcher, and direct students’ attention to the box labeled Paragraph 1. Remind students of their work in the previous lesson, and explain that they will do similar work today.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask:</p></li>
<li><p>“Identify in the first paragraph the words that help develop the author’s purpose and point of view.” (Words that reveal point of view include <strong>grim</strong>, <strong>dies</strong>, <strong>sad</strong>, and <strong>clogged</strong>.)</p></li>
<li><p>“What kinds of words are these?” (Strong verbs and precise nouns.)</p></li>
<li><p>“What do these kinds of words do?” (They create powerful images and convey the author’s attitude or point of view.)</p></li>
<li><p>Invite students to complete the note-catcher in the Paragraph 1 box. Ask: “Why would the author choose to begin the article way?” (This approach makes her own differing point of view more clear.)</p></li>

<td>Reread the second paragraph.</td>

<li><p>Focus students’ attention on the first sentence of the second paragraph: “But the world is taking note and countries, the private sector, and communities are starting to act.” Invite students to Turn and Talk: “How does this sentence help you to understand the purpose of the paragraph?” (It lists groups who are taking action with plastic pollution, so you know that the purpose of the paragraph is to describe ways in which people have taken action to solve the problem of plastic pollution.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask students to record the purpose of the paragraph on their note-catchers.</p></li>
<li><p>Focus students’ attention on the second sentence of the second paragraph: “From bans and taxes on various single-use plastics, to investments in waste collection, and policies on reduced plastics packaging, to beach clean-ups.” Invite students to Turn and talk: “What evidence does the author provide that people are taking action?” (Bans, taxes, investments, policies, and beach cleanups.) Ask students to record this evidence on their note-catchers in the appropriate section.</p></li>
<li><p>Focus students’ attention on the third sentence of the second paragraph: “We are trying to break the addiction to plastics, and contribute to healthier lives and a healthier planet.” Invite students to Turn and Talk:</p></li>
<li><p>“Which words jump out at you as naming the author’s point of view?” (“break the addiction to plastics,” “healthier lives,” “healthier planet.”)</p></li>
<li><p>“How do these words contribute to the author’s point of view?” (The idea that we are <strong>addicted</strong> to plastic furthers the author’s point of view that plastic is something harmful that we need to rid ourselves of and stop consuming.)</p></li>
<li><p>“What other words in this paragraph contribute to the author’s point of view?” (“the world is taking note,” “starting to act.”)</p></li>
<li><p>Invite students to record the author’s point of view along with the revealing language on their note-catchers. “What is the implicit point of view here in the first two paragraphs?” (The problem of plastic pollution in the water is overwhelming.)</p></li>

<td>Reread paragraph 3.</td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Ask students what understanding they can gather about the World Bank from the article. (It is a bank, and probably serves the world.)</p></li>
<li><p>Inform students that the World Bank is a global organization that invests money in projects in developing countries. It started right after World War II with a mission to end world poverty.</p></li>
<li><p>“What does getting rid of plastics have to do with poverty in developing countries?” (Wealthy nations often send their plastic waste to developing countries, and plastic waste is more impactful in developing countries because there are no effective systems for dealing with the waste.)</p></li>
<li><p>“Who is the author, and what is her title?” (Anjali Acharya, senior environmental specialist.)</p></li>
<li><p>“Whom does she work for?” (The World Bank.)</p></li>
<li><p>“How might this impact her point of view?” (She will be in support of the World Bank and their point of view.)</p></li>
<li><p>“How might her point of view differ from a journalist’s point of view?” (A journalist would be trying to report on events from a more neutral perspective; Anjali works for the World Bank, so is writing in support of their efforts.)</p></li>
<li><p>Focus students’ attention on the first and second sentences of the third paragraph: “This year, World Environment Day focuses on ‘Beating Plastic Pollution’. The World Bank is contributing to this effort, using our suite of lending instruments and policy dialogue with key countries and cities to help identify and finance solutions to address the marine plastics issue.” Invite students to Turn and Talk: “How does this sentence help you to understand the purpose of the paragraph?” (To describe the actions that the World Bank is taking to solve the problem of plastic pollution.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask students to record their thinking about the purpose of the third paragraph on their note-catchers. Ask students to Turn and Talk: “What evidence does the author provide that the World Bank is working to solve the problem of plastic pollution?” (Investments in municipal solid waste management systems: $4.5 billion to help improve more than 300 solid waste management programs to reduce pollution leakage; a series of plastics pollution hotspot analyses.) Invite students to record this evidence on their note-catchers.</p></li>
<li><p>“What is the author’s point of view at this point? How do you know?” (The author feels that the World Bank can beat plastic pollution by identifying and financing solutions and investing. I know this because of the key language the author uses, such as “quick wins.”)</p></li>
<li><p>“What other language tells you the author’s point of view?” (“beating plastic pollution,” “identify and finance solutions,” “long-term strategic investor,” “help,” “reduce pollution leakage,” “our environment.”) Invite students to record this language as well as the author’s point of view on their note-catchers.</p></li>

<li><p>“How would you describe the pattern of who each paragraph is addressing, moving from the first to the fifth paragraph? Are the paragraphs addressing larger groups or smaller as the article goes on?” (The article starts with the largest group, with the worldwide problem of plastic pollution and lots of different group’s solutions, and then gets smaller, with the World Bank’s solutions, and then gets smaller still, with what individuals can do to prompt change.)</p></li>
<li><p>“Why would the author choose to start large and then narrow down to what you as an individual can do?” (It makes the problem seem solvable and inspires hope and change.)</p></li>
<li><p>“What is the author’s point of view about who should solve plastic pollution?” (The author thinks that all people should try to solve the problem of plastic pollution.)</p></li>
<li><p>“How does this approach support the author’s point of view?” (Starting large and then narrowing down supports the idea that just one person can make a difference.) Invite students to record the purpose as well as label whom is being addressed in each paragraph on their note-catchers.</p></li>
<li><p>“What does the word <strong>but</strong> at the beginning of paragraph 4 do?” (It points out that the author is doing another round of distinguishing her point of view from others.)</p></li>
<li><p>“What language supports the point of view in paragraphs 4–5?” (“it is going to take more,” “everyone needs to be on board,” “individual actions count,” “five things you can do,” “starting today,” “end plastic pollution.”) Remind students to record this language on their note-catcher.</p></li>

How do the images of “pristine beaches” and “happy turtles” contrast with the images in the first paragraph and help to develop the author’s purpose in this article? (The purpose of the last paragraph is to invite readers to take action against plastic pollution. The author wants readers to know that change is possible. The author uses images of “pristine beaches” and “happy turtles” to show what would happen if we got rid of plastic pollution. These images contrast with the first paragraph of the article, which describes a turtle getting sick from plastic and all the plastic products that “wash up daily on beaches worldwide.” By using contrasting images, the author can try to turn hopelessness to hope.)</p></li>
