Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.7.1 – Opening A: On an entrance ticket, students grapple to recall the meaning of argument terms that they learned in Modules 2 and 3 when they analyzed argument articles and wrote a literary argument essay.

- W.7.1 – Work Time A: Students use the Painted Essay® structure to analyze a model argument essay and add to their understanding of the criteria of an effective argument essay.

- W.7.5 – Closing and Assessment A: Students work in pairs to guide each other through the process of using the Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer to plan an argument essay on plastic pollution.

- In this lesson, students analyze a model essay using the Painted Essay® structure to generate criteria for their own essays (W.7.1, W.7.4).

- The Painted Essay® (Diana Leddy, Vermont Writing Collaborative) guides students to code each section of their essay a different color to understand each part, the content of each part, and how the different parts connect.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners, persevering and collaborating as they plan their practice essay.

- The Think-Pair-Share protocol is used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release those students who are ready to read and analyze the model independently and then move on to planning their practice essay with a partner rather than during modeling.

- Provide students with other model argument essays (from printed materials or student work from other years and other modules) and challenge them to annotate them using the Argument Writing checklist. Then students can share with their classmates what makes these models strong.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Students have worked with the Painted Essay® structure in previous modules. In this unit, they use the same structure, focusing on how the structure applies to argument writing.

- The model essay that students analyze is about resolving the problem of plastic pollution at the beginning of the life cycle of plastic (before it is produced). Although this essay explores a different point in the life cycle of plastic than the one students analyze in their own essays, both writing tasks require very similar thinking and writing skills. In this set of lessons, students will analyze language and techniques in the model that can be used to express similar ideas in their own writing pieces.

Support All Students

- For students who may be overwhelmed by too much print on a page, reduce anxiety and support sustained effort by offering a copy of the model essay with one paragraph per page. ▲

- Students may require additional support when reading for gist. Pair students heterogeneously for this activity, or read aloud to a group of students who may need additional reading support. ▲

- In Lessons 7–11, students work with the same partner on a pair-written argument essay. Provide differentiated mentors by purposefully preselecting student partnerships. Meet with the mentors in advance to encourage them to share their thought process with their partner. ▲

- Note there is a differentiated version of the Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer used in Closing and Assessment A in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson includes a whole-class, teacher-led review of a model essay as well as collaboration and color-coding to paint and plan an essay.

- ELLs may find it challenging to generate language for planning their essay. Encourage students to use their home language and sketches to assist them in planning. Also use strategic pairings for the pair essay either by home language, level, or heterogeneous for support.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, 7.I.B.6, 7.I.B.7, 7.I.C.11, 7.II.A.1, 7.II.B.3, and 7.II.B.4.

Assessment Guidance

- Throughout Work Time A, frequently review students’ work to ensure they are color-coding accurately. Use common issues as whole group teaching points.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will begin their practice essays. They will use the criteria and plans they develop in this lesson to draft their practice essays in Lessons 9–12 with instruction and support. This will prepare them to independently plan and draft a new argument essay for the end of unit assessment.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.7.1 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 7**.

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique to review their responses. Record *argument*, *main* *claim*, *point*, *evidence*, *reasoning*, and *relevant* on the **academic** **word** **wall** with translations in home languages, where appropriate, and invite students to record words in their **vocabulary** **logs**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

- During the Opening activity, encourage students to grapple to recall the definitions, then they can form partnerships to confirm their definitions.

For Heavier Support

- During the Opening activity, encourage students to work in pairs to grapple to recall the definitions, then they can use their vocabulary logs or dictionaries to confirm their definitions.

Work Time

A. Analyze a Model – W.7.1 (25 minutes)

- Review appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify the parts of a model argument essay and explain the purpose of each.”

- Distribute and display the **Model Argument Essay: “Reduce Plastic Pollution in the Beginning of Its Life Cycle.”** Explain that students will read and reread the model throughout this unit. In this lesson, they will read for a general understanding of content and structure. Read the model aloud as students follow along, reading silently.

- Using a total participation technique, invite responses from the group:

“What is this essay about?” (This essay is about the need to reduce plastic pollution, and the idea that the beginning of its life cycle is the best place to reduce it.)

“What sentence in the piece best expresses this main idea? (“These efforts are helpful, but the most effective place to reduce plastic pollution is at the beginning of its life cycle.”)

- Point out that the writer uses evidence to support his claim, which helps the reader trust the writer and understand his claim. Emphasize that the essays they write, like the model, will be grounded in evidence from the text. Refocus students on the Model Argument Essay.

- Reread aloud the first paragraph as students follow along, reading silently.

- Turn and Talk:

“What is the gist of this paragraph?” (Plastic pollution is a major problem, we should target it at the beginning.)

- Cold-call students to share out. As students share, capture their response next to the first paragraph on the displayed model. Refer to **Model Argument Essay: “Reduce Plastic Pollution in the Beginning of Its Life Cycle” (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Invite students to work in pairs to determine the gist for each of the remaining paragraphs, supporting and clarifying as needed.

- Gists:

- Paragraph 1: plastic pollution is a major problem, we should target it at the beginning

- Paragraph 2: can use replacement materials

- Paragraph 3: can ban plastic

- Paragraph 4: other ideas are okay, but the beginning is best

- After several minutes, refocus the whole group and use total participation techniques to select students to share the gist of each paragraph with the whole group.

- Display a **Painted Essay® template**, and direct students to retrieve this resource from Module 2. Have students Turn and Talk to a predesignated partner that they will consult for the remainder of the lesson:

“Describe how this template is organized, and explain the name and purpose of each part of the template.” (Students share the purpose of each section, naming the colors and their correspondence to each part of the essay.)

- Display the Model Argument Essay: “Reduce Plastic Pollution in the Beginning of Its Life Cycle.” Distribute **colored pencils**, and guide students in using these and their Painted Essay® template with their partners to color-code their Model Essay: “Reduce Plastic Pollution in the Beginning of Its Life Cycle” using the following directions:

- Read the first paragraph aloud as students follow along, pausing to color-code each part of the paragraph.

- Read the context in the first paragraph, stopping at “People have suggested buying less plastic at the middle of the plastic life cycle or inventing new ways to clean up plastic at the end of the life cycle.”

- Ask students to Turn and Talk:

“What is the purpose of the sentences I just read? What color should they be?” (The purpose of the sentences is to provide background information on the problem of plastic pollution and different solutions people have proposed, and they should be red.)

- Read the main claim of the first paragraph: “These efforts are helpful, but the most effective place to reduce plastic pollution is at the beginning of its life cycle. By inventing and using new materials and banning plastic as much as possible, we can help ensure a future that is free of plastic pollution.”

“What is the purpose of these sentences, and what colors should they be?” (The purpose of these sentences is to state the opinion that we should target the beginning of the plastic life cycle in order to reduce plastic pollution. They provide the main idea that the reader should take away. They should be colored green, yellow, and blue.)

Explain that the focus statement of this piece is a bit tricky, as it is two sentences, so the class will color-code it together.

- Clarify the language students will use to name the parts of an argument essay. Remind students that in an argument essay the focus statement is referred to as the *main claim*. Like a focus statement in an informative essay, the main claim tells what the piece will be about.

- Guide students in understanding the main claim by asking the following questions:

“What is the opinion the writer is supporting?” (We should target the beginning of the plastic life cycle in order to reduce plastic pollution.)

“Which single sentence best expresses this idea?” (“These efforts are helpful, but the most effective place to reduce plastic pollution is at the beginning of its life cycle.”)

- Direct students to color this sentence green.

“Think back to the gist statements you wrote for each paragraph. What are the two points the author is making?” (Point 1: “We can invent and use new materials besides plastic.” Point 2: “We can ban plastic.”)

“Which sentence in the essay previews these two points?” (“By inventing and using new materials and banning plastic as much as possible, we can help ensure a future that is free of plastic pollution.”)

- Guide students in color-coding the first point yellow and the second point blue. Refer to the Model Argument Essay (for reference) as necessary.

- Read Proof Paragraph 1.

- Ask students to Turn and Talk:

“What is the function of this paragraph in the essay?” (To show how plastic pollution can be reduced by inventing and using new materials.)

“What color should it be?” (Yellow.)

“Why?” (Because it supports the yellow point that inventing and using new materials is an effective way to target plastic pollution.)

- Read Proof Paragraph 2.

- Ask students to Turn and Talk:

“What is the function of this paragraph in the essay?” (To show how plastic pollution can be reduced by banning plastic.)

“What color should it be?” (Blue.)

“Why?” (Because it supports the blue point that banning plastic is a good way to address the problem of plastic pollution.)

- Read the conclusion of the model essay.

- Ask students:

“What is the role of the conclusion in an argument essay?” (Students should mention that the conclusion should wrap up the piece by restating the main claim and adding some additional thinking about why it is important. For example, in the model, this paragraph restates the claim and reflects on how the beginning of plastic’s life cycle is the most logical place to target in order to reduce pollution.)

“What color should you code it? Why?” (It should be green because it synthesizes the claim, point 1, and point 2. Students might also mention that the shade of green differs from that used in the main claim in the introduction. This shows that when they run the ideas in the yellow paragraph and the ideas in the blue paragraph through their own mind they come together to make something new—their own thinking on the topic—but still connected to the claim.)

If students are ready, consider deepening this analysis by working together to color-code the sentences that refer to each point blue and yellow. Refer to the Model Argument Essay (for reference) as necessary.

- When students finish analyzing the model, display the **Criteria of an Effective Argument anchor chart**, and ask students to share out additional criteria generated during the above exploration of the model. Note that, at this point, students may only identify the general structure and some of the key criteria (main claim, points, evidence, and elaboration.) The class will add to the anchor chart details about the criteria of each paragraph in the following lessons.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- For Work Time A, explain to students that completing the analysis independently will prepare them for doing so on their assessment in the following lesson. Remind students that they have completed similar analysis and note-catchers throughout the unit and are prepared for this challenge.

- During Work Time A, students may note the author’s use of word relationships to help the reader understand words. Ask students to Turn and Talk to remind each other of what relationships authors use to help readers understand words (synonyms, anonyms, and analogies). For further practice with this concept, ask students to work with a partner to reread sentences with word relationships (such as *ban* and *stop* in the first two sentences of the third paragraph). Students can use the word *stop* to help them define the word *ban*. Reviewing this strategy in context helps ensure student acquisition of it.

For Heavier Support

- At the end of Work Time A, collect students’ questions in order to review them as a formative assessment to ensure students are ready for the mid-unit assessment in the following lesson. If not, spend another lesson on analyzing the authors’ use of evidence.

- During Work Time A, if possible, provide students with a partially painted essay in which the topic sentence of each paragraph is painted, so students may follow the model. Also, if possible, pair students into homogeneous language groups. As needed, allow students to use their home languages as a resource to help them interpret the essay and paint it appropriately.

Closing and Assessment

A. Pair Practice: Plan an Argument Essay – W.7.5 (15 minutes)

- Review appropriate the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can plan an argument essay to support the claim that we should reduce plastic pollution by targeting the end of the plastic life cycle.”

- Explain that students will now prepare to write their own essays defending the claim that we should reduce plastic pollution by targeting the end of the plastic life cycle. Display and distribute **Directions for** **Pair Argument Essay**. Read the directions aloud, and ask students to follow along.

- Using a total participation technique, invite responses from the group:

“What is the topic of your essay?” (We should reduce plastic pollution by targeting the end of the plastic life cycle.)

- Tell students that as they plan, they should remember to support their ideas with evidence from the texts they analyzed throughout Units 1 and 2. Allow time for students to retrieve their copies of the **texts from Module 4, Units 1 and 2**: *A Plastic Ocean*, *Trash Vortex*, “Five Weird Materials That Could Replace Plastic,” “Five Things You Can Do to End Plastic Pollution,” and “Boyan Slat: The Great Pacific Garbage Patch Kid.”

- Display and distribute the **Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer** and the **Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer** ▲ as necessary. The differentiated organizer supports students’ writing with sentence frames and simplified questions. ▲ Remind students that they used a similar graphic organizer to plan their essays in Modules 1, 2, and 3. As necessary, review each section, asking volunteers to explain what kinds of information they will write in each section.

- Explain to students that they will use this graphic organizer to work together to plan their pair-written argument essay. In this lesson, they will roughly sketch out what will go into each paragraph. In the following lessons, they will have more time to add details to this graphic organizer as they plan and write the essay together. Move students into predetermined pairs.

- If pairs are ready to begin planning their essay independently, release them to do so. Use the following scaffolding for students who need more support planning an argument essay. ▲

- Focus students on the focus question section at the top of the Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer. Ask students to copy the focus from the Directions for Pair Argument Essay in this space. Refer to **Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer (example for teacher reference)** for sample responses.

- Turn and Talk, allowing time for students to fill in the appropriate sections of their graphic organizers:

“What is the main idea of your essay?” (The most effective place to reduce plastic pollution is at the end of its life cycle. By finding ways to stop discarded plastic from getting into the ocean and cleaning up the plastic that is already.)

“What context or background information will you need to give readers so they can understand this main idea? Consider terms your readers might need to have defined.” (Answers will vary, but may include the following: The reader needs to understand the problems that plastic pollution causes as well as other solutions people have proposed.)

- Display the **Plastic Life Cycle anchor chart**. Have students review it and then Think-Pair-Share:

“What possible plastic pollution solutions are there at the end of the plastic life cycle?” (Answers will vary, but may include: A specially engineered ocean vacuum cleaner, barriers that collect plastic, biodegradation efforts with wax worms and mealworms.)

- Have students work in pairs to write a main claim in the main claim section of their graphic organizers. Remind students that main claims usually contain key words from the writing assignment and that they should preview the main points students will discuss in their essay. Provide sentence starters as necessary:

“These efforts are helpful, but the most effective place to reduce plastic pollution is at the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of its life cycle. By \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, we can help ensure a future that is free of plastic pollution.” ▲

- Offer students options for writing utensils. Also, consider offering partial dictation of student responses. ▲

- Ask:

“How do the actions we take at the end of the plastic life cycle help reduce plastic pollution?” (Answers will vary. Cleaning up plastic takes the tons of plastic out of the environment and disposes of it properly.)

- Release students to complete the rest of their graphic organizers in pairs. Remind students that they should consider the texts they’ve studied so far in this module for examples to support their claims. Also, explain that students don’t need to write complete sentences in their graphic organizer. They can just take notes. Circulate to support students as they plan. Refer to the Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer (example for teacher reference) and the **Model Pair Argument Essay: “Reduce Plastic Pollution in the End of Its Life Cycle” (example for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Before students leave class, ensure students understand the homework assignment. As necessary, remind students that modifying phrases are ones that describe a noun. Dangling and misplaced modifiers are phrases that are improperly placed in a sentence. Also, as necessary, allow students several minutes to begin the homework so they can receive additional support as necessary. Inform students that they will review their responses with a partner at the beginning of the following lesson.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target and the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- Challenge students to model orally rehearsing their plans for classmates who need heavier support. Doing so will also strengthen their own’ plans for their essays.

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive on the focus statement from the **Model Argument Essay**. Provide ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Invite students to predict some of the questions that the Language Dive may ask. This will improve students’ metacognition and challenge their awareness of the most interesting or meaningful elements of the sentence.

For Heavier Support

- Invite students to use the **Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer** ▲. The sentence starters and rephrased questions in this resource support students in planning their essay.

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive on the focus statement from the **Model Argument Essay**. Provide ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Encourage students to independently reflect on this sentence and its meaning before the next lesson. Students may also wish to use dictionaries to add any unknown vocabulary and meanings to their **vocabulary logs**.

Homework

A. Modifying Phrases

- Students create sentences from phrases without misplaced or dangling modifiers to complete **Homework: Modifying Phrases: Lesson 7**.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.

For Lighter Support

- Before students leave class, ask them to read the homework assignment and discuss it with a partner. Challenge students to read the introductory information at the top of the homework and discuss it, explaining modifying phrases to each other. Allow time for students to work with a partner to answer the first item together to make sure they can complete the homework independently.

For Heavier Support

- Before students leave class, review the homework assignments and ensure that students understand that they will continue their independent research reading and complete a brief activity on modifying phrases. Read aloud the introductory information at the top of the homework, pausing to ensure that students highlight and understand the definitions of *modifying phrase*, *noun*, and *dangling*. Work together with students to complete the first item, then challenge them to complete the second item with a partner to make sure they can complete the homework independently.
