(For Teacher Reference)

**Focus:**

Write an essay defending the idea that the end of the plastic life cycle is the best place to target in order to reduce plastic pollution.

**Introduction Paragraph**

How will you catch the reader’s attention? (Use facts, statistics, quotations, or anecdotes.)

describe problems that plastic causes in our oceans and the surprise at finding plastic on the beach; explain how much plastic is in the oceans

What context about the text or topic does your reader need to make sense of the rest of your essay?

the problems that plastic pollution causes; other solutions people have proposed

Opposing Claim: What counterclaim might others raise to refute your claim?

People have tried to create new materials to replace plastic at the beginning of the life cycle and buying less plastic in the middle of its life cycle.

Briefly Refute: How do you respond to this counterclaim?

These efforts are helpful, but the most effective place to reduce plastic pollution is at the end of the life cycle.

**Main Claim:**

We can help ensure a future that is free of plastic pollution by disposing of it and cleaning it up better.

**Proof Paragraph 1**

Point 1: What is the first point you are offering to support your claim?

One way we can reduce plastic pollution is by disposing of plastic more intelligently.

Context: What context does the reader need to understand the evidence you are using?

why so much plastic goes into the ocean and what we can do to dispose of it in other ways

Evidence: What evidence from the text(s) supports this point?

Danielle Smith-Llera in *Trash Vortex*: for “a third of the people” in the world “there is no waste management system” (41). Stopping this flow would reduce plastic pollution.

Elaboration: What reasons or reasoning develops your point and ties the point back to the claim?

The lack of infrastructure and how we can improve it and use alternatives to dispose of plastic (Smith-Llera) ties to the main claim: the end is the best point in the plastic life cycle to reduce pollution.

**Proof Paragraph 2**

Point 2: What is the second point you are offering to support your claim?

Another way we can reduce plastic pollution is to clean up the plastic from the ocean.

Context: What context does the reader need to understand the evidence you are using?

how much plastic is now in the ocean and the new methods for cleaning it up

Evidence: What evidence from the text(s) supports this point?

Boyan Slat and over seventy engineers have designed a “2000-foot long barrier” that “moves with the currents and traps plastics” (Betteley).

Elaboration: What reasons or reasoning develops your point and ties the point back to the claim?

Cleaning up the ocean is the only way to remove the plastic that is already in it; this ties back to the main claim: the end is the best point in the plastic life cycle to reduce plastic pollution.

**Conclusion Paragraph**

Restate your claim from the introduction:

Some argue that focusing our efforts at the beginning is best.

Others say we should fight plastic where people buy and use it, in the middle.

These efforts are important, but the most effective place to focus is the end of the cycle.

**Briefly restate your main points:**

Point 1:

We can dispose of plastic more carefully.

Point 2:

We can clean up the plastic that is already in the ocean.

What are your further reflections on this topic?

- Why does this argument/claim matter?

- What would happen if this claim were not acted upon?

- Who is likely to benefit from this?

There is already so much plastic pollution that to make a difference we

need to keep any more from getting into the ocean, as well as clean up what

is already there. Sometimes, it’s better to begin at the end.
