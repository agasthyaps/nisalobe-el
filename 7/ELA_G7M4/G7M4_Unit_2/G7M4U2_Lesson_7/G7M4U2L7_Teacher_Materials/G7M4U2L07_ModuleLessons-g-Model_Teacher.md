Model Pair Argument Essay: “Reduce Plastic Pollution in the End of Its Life Cycle”

W.7.1

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Prompt:** Write an essay defending the idea that the end of the plastic life cycle is the best place to target to reduce plastic pollution.

Whales, jellyfish, beautiful reefs—and ugly plastic bags? You won’t find the latter listed in a guidebook for your favorite vacation place. But you might find plenty of those along the beach. Unfortunately, a lot of the plastic we use ends up in the ocean. Some scientists estimate that as much as “8 million metric tons of plastic found its way to the ocean in 2010” (Hullinger). We must take action to reduce plastic pollution. People have tried to create new materials to replace plastic at the beginning of the plastic life cycle, or proposed buying less plastic at the middle of the plastic life cycle. These efforts are helpful, but the most effective place to reduce plastic pollution is at the end of its life cycle. By finding ways to stop discarded plastic from getting into the ocean and cleaning up the plastic that is already there, we can help ensure a future that is free of plastic pollution.

We can begin by keeping plastic out of our oceans. We can make a huge difference just by disposing of plastic more intelligently. One big reason why plastic gets into the ocean is because the landfills in many places cannot properly contain it. Danielle Smith-Llera explains in *Trash Vortex* that for “a third of the people” in the world “there is no waste management system” (41). Helping to improve these waste management systems would reduce plastic pollution enormously. But that isn’t the only way to target plastic pollution at the end of the life cycle. Smith-Llera writes that scientists are looking to “nature for ideas” to help us dispose of used plastic (46). Specifically, they are studying organisms that help break down plastic. For example, certain organisms can take our used plastics and “turn them into food” (Smith-Llera 46). This is just one example that shows how focusing on reducing plastic pollution at the end of its life cycle can be extremely effective.

Another way to target plastic pollution at the end of its life cycle is by removing what is already there in our oceans. Boyan Slat’s story shows how people can become motivated to find new, creative cleaning solutions—no matter their age. Slat was sixteen when he was diving in Greece and he “noticed more plastic bags than fish” (Betteley). A few years later he decided to dedicate himself to cleaning up the ocean. He came up with the idea for a net that would stay in one place and trap the plastic that would float into it. Slat got a lot of support in a short period of time. He and over seventy engineers designed a “2000-foot long barrier” that “moves with the currents and traps plastics” (Betteley). Some argue that his cleanup program won’t have a big enough effect. But Slat “imagines that eventually, up to 60 devices that will ride the waves, collecting thousands of tons of debris a year” (Betteley). Innovative cleaning solutions like this demonstrate that targeting plastic pollution at the end of the plastic life cycle can work.

Plastic pollution is one of the most urgent problems we face. As Smith-Llera writes in *Trash Vortex*, “\[e\]very day people fight the war on plastic pollution” (50). But in this fight, we have to make a choice about how to best spend our energy. Some argue that targeting the beginning of the life cycle, before plastic is made, is best. Others say we can do the most by making better decisions as consumers in the middle of the life cycle. These efforts are important, but the best place to focus is at the end of the cycle. To make a difference we need to prevent any more plastic from getting into the ocean, as well as clean up what is already there. Sometimes, it’s better to begin at the end.
