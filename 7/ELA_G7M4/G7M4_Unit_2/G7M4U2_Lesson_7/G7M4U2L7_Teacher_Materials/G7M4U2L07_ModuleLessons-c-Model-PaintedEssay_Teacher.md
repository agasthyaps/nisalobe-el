**Prompt:** Write an essay defending the idea that the beginning of the plastic life cycle is the best place to target to reduce plastic pollution.

W.7.1a: First three sentences of paragraph give context.

W.7.1a: Sentence acknowledges alternate claim.

W.7.1a: Sentence introduces claim.

W.7.1c: Paragraph includes words like **for example** and **according to** clarify relationships between evidence and claim.

W.7.1b: Paragraph uses relevant evidence and logical reasoning to support the claim.

It’s easy to forget about plastic once you’re done using it, but the problem doesn’t go away. A plastic bottle could be around for five hundred years before it starts to decay (Hullinger). One whale could swallow as many as 80 plastic bags (Acharya). We must take action to reduce plastic pollution. People have suggested buying less plastic at the middle of the plastic life cycle or inventing new ways to clean up plastic at the end of the life cycle. These efforts are helpful, but the most effective place to reduce plastic pollution is at the beginning of its life cycle. By inventing and using new materials and banning plastic as much as possible, we can help ensure a future that is free of plastic pollution.

Many replacement materials for plastic already exist. We just need to start using them. An article by Jessica Hullinger in *The Week* magazine mentions some better alternatives for plastic. For example, there is already a company that makes water bottles out of a material that you can actually eat. There is even a scientist who is using shrimp shells to make plastic bags. According to the article, “Just two pounds of shells can yield 15 biodegradable shopping bags.” If shrimp shells are not interesting enough, what about mushrooms? A company called “Ecovative Design” is using mushrooms and other materials to create containers that can biodegrade in as few as 180 days. These are just a few examples that show that we already have new technologies for replacing plastic. The fact that we can successfully invent and use these alternative materials shows that focusing on reducing plastic pollution at the beginning of its life cycle can be extremely effective.

Another way to reduce plastic pollution from the beginning of its life cycle is to simply ban plastic. All around the world, people are taking action to stop plastic from beginning its journey from factory to ocean. According to the documentary *A Plastic Ocean*, Rwanda was the first country to ban plastic bags. Likewise, Danielle Smith-Llera writes in *Trash Vortex* that “\[m\]ore than 200 U.S. cities have banned plastic bags” (51). Some may argue that banning plastic is unrealistic. However, these examples show that it is possible to stop the use of plastic before it starts. Communities are making smarter, safer choices when it comes to plastic. The success of efforts to convince communities to ban plastic across the world demonstrates that targeting plastic pollution at the beginning of plastic’s life cycle can work.

The problem of plastic pollution is one of the most urgent that we face. As Smith-Llera writes in *Trash Vortex*, “\[e\]very day people fight the war on plastic pollution” (50). However, in this fight, we have to make a choice about how to best spend our energy. Some argue that focusing our effort in the middle of the life cycle, where consumers make choices, is best. Others say we should fight plastic where it already is by cleaning it up. These efforts are important, but the most effective place to focus is at the beginning. After all, how better to reduce plastic pollution than to create less plastic in the first place?

W.7.1d: Includes words like **Likewise** and **However** instead of **And** or **But** to establish and maintain a formal style.

W.7.1e: Provides concluding section that follows from and supports the argument by restating the points and offering a new but connected thought.
