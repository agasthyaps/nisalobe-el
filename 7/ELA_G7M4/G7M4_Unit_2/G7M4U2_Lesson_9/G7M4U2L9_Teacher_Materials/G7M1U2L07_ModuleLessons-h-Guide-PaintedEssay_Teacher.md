Paint an Essay Lesson Plan

W.7.2

(For Teacher Reference)

Introduction (red)

1.  Point to the first paragraph of the model “Using History in *A Long Walk to Water*,” and remind students of the gist statement for this paragraph.

2.  Read the sentences marked “red” on the **Compare and Contrast Model Essay (example for teacher reference)**. Using a total participation technique, invite responses from the group:

“What is the purpose of the first sentences of this paragraph?” (Gives the reader information they need to know to make sense of the rest of the essay and grab readers’ attention so they want to read more. For example, in the model, the introduction describes the Sudanese civil war at the beginning so that readers understand the subject and are interested to learn more.)

3.  Explain that you are going to color the first part of this paragraph red because it is an eye-catching color, like the information catching the reader’s attention. Refer to the Compare and Contrast Model Essay (example for teacher reference).

4.  Focus students on the first box at the top of their **Painted Essay<sup>®</sup> Template** that says “Introduction.” Invite students to paint this red, just as you did on the model “Using History in *A Long Walk to Water*.” Emphasize that they are to stay in the lines and not to paint into the Focus Statement box.

5.  When most have finished, instruct students to put their brushes down.

Focus Statement (green)

6.  Repeat steps 1–5 with the next part of the model “Using History in *A Long Walk to Water*”—the focus statement—marked “green” on the Compare and Contrast Model Essay (example for teacher reference). Students will paint in green. Ensure students understand that the focus statement provides the main idea that you want the reader to take away. In the case of the model essay, the focus statement is actually several sentences. Explain that a focus statement can be a few sentences. For example, in the model, the focus statement: “Comparing the two texts shows how Park used historical events in the novel. Many of the same major events are described in both texts. However, the authors focus their attention differently in the two accounts.”

Points 1 and 2 (yellow and blue)

7.  Repeat steps 1–5 with the next part of the model “Using History in *A Long Walk to Water*,” points 1 and 2, marked “yellow” and “blue” on the Compare and Contrast Model Essay (example for teacher reference). Students will paint in yellow and blue. Ensure students understand that the two points break down the focus statement into two parts, which will be explained in the writing to support the focus statement. For example, in the model, the two points are that many of the major events are described similarly in each text, but that the authors have chosen to focus their attention on different parts of the journey the Lost Boys took.

8.  Briefly check all student work before moving on to the next step.

Proof Paragraph 1 (yellow)

9.  Repeat steps 1–5 with the next part of the model “Using History in *A Long Walk to Water*”—Proof Paragraph 1—marked “yellow” on the Compare and Contrast Model Essay (example for teacher reference). Students will paint in yellow. Ensure students understand that the purpose of this paragraph is to give evidence and reasons to prove point 1. This can look lots of different ways depending on what the essay is about. It needs to be specific and supports the main point. For example, in the model, this paragraph uses examples from each text to show how they treat the same events in a similar way.

10. Briefly check all student work before moving on to the next step.

Transition (yellow and blue)

11. Repeat steps 1–5 with the next part of the model “Using History in *A Long Walk to Water*”—transition—marked “yellow and blue” on the Compare and Contrast Model Essay (example for teacher reference). Students will paint in both yellow and blue—their designs can be however they’d like, as long as both colors are identifiable. For example, students could paint blue and yellow stripes or blue and yellow polka dots. Ensure students understand that the purpose of this sentence is to provide a transition between the ideas in Proof Paragraph 1 and the ideas in Proof Paragraph 2. For example, in the model, this sentence links Proof Paragraph 1, which was about how the authors of the two texts treat events similarly, to Proof Paragraph 2, which gives evidence of how the authors focus their attention on different parts of the journey the Lost Boys took.

12. Briefly check all student work before moving on to the next step.

Proof Paragraph 2 (blue)

13. Repeat steps 1–5 with the next part of the model “Using History in *A Long Walk to Water*”—Proof Paragraph 2—marked “blue” on the Compare and Contrast Model Essay (example for teacher reference). Students will paint in blue. Ensure students understand that the purpose of this paragraph is to give evidence and reasons to prove point 2. For example, in the model, this paragraph provides evidence from both texts that shows how the authors focus their attention on different parts of the journey the Lost Boys took.

14. Briefly check all student work before moving on to the next step.

Conclusion (green, yellow, and blue)

15. Point to the final paragraph of the model “Using History in *A Long Walk to Water*” and remind students of the gist statement for this paragraph.

16. Read the final paragraph, sentences marked “green,” “yellow,” and “blue,” on the Compare and Contrast Model Essay (example for teacher reference). Using a total participation technique, invite responses from the group:

“What is the purpose of this final paragraph?” (The purpose is to wrap up the piece by restating the focus and adding some of your own thinking about why it is important. For example, in the model, this paragraph restates the focus statement (“Although the article and the novel focus on different parts of the journey, they discuss similar events”) and gives possible reasons for why the texts differ as they do, including the different audiences they were written for and the ages of the main characters themselves.)

17. Explain that you are going to color the first part of this paragraph in green, yellow, and blue because it is a mix of the focus statement, point 1, and point 2. Refer to the Compare and Contrast Model Essay (example for teacher reference).

18. Invite students to mix their yellow and blue paints to make a shade of green. Explain that this shade of green is different from the color used for the focus statement, and is probably a bit different from the green created by other members of the class. This color should remind students that the conclusion is a place for their own reflections. To write the conclusion, they run the ideas in the yellow paragraph and the ideas in the blue paragraph through their own minds and bring them together to make something new—their own thinking on the topic! Be sure that students notice that, although different shades, both the conclusion and the focus statement are green. Their reflections in the conclusion must still connect back to the focus statement. Refer to the model for an example.

19. Invite students to use the green they made to paint the final box on their template.

20. Review the structure of the model using the colors, emphasizing the name and purpose of each part of the essay, as well as the relationship between them.
