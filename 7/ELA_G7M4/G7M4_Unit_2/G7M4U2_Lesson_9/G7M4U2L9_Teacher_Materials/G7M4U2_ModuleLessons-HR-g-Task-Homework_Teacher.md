Homework: Coordinate Adjectives: Lesson 9

(Example for Teacher Reference)

In Language Dives, you have been introduced to coordinate adjectives. Remember that coordinate adjectives are two or more adjectives that go together to describe the same noun. We can connect the adjectives using **and** or a comma. In this unit, you will practice using a comma to connect these adjectives, as in the sentences from the model below:

An article by Jessica Hullinger in *The Week* magazine mentions a few **different, better** alternatives for plastic.

Communities are making **smarter, safer** choices when it comes to plastic.

Notice how the adjectives **different** and **better** both modify the noun **alternatives** in the first sentence, and how the adjectives **smarter**, **safer** both modify the noun **choices** in the second sentence.

Be aware that not all pairs of adjectives are coordinate adjectives. Sometimes, an adjective is modifying a phrase that goes together, as in the example: **red fire truck**. **Red** and **fire** are both adjectives, but **fire truck** works as a phrase that **red** is modifying, so no comma is needed. A good way to test if adjectives need a comma between them is to see if it makes sense to say **and** between the words. In the examples above, it makes sense to say **different and better alternatives** and **smarter and safer choices**. It doesn’t make sense to say **red and fire truck**, though, so no comma is needed.

**Directions:** Notice that commas are missing from the sentences below. Place commas between the coordinate adjectives.

1.  “Plastic in our coastal waters is pulled into the center of **massive, wind-driven**, churning circular gyres.” (*A Plastic Ocean*, 45:28)

2.  “There are many **big, sharp** pieces of plastic.” (*A Plastic Ocean*, 47:09)

3.  “Look at the size of that **big, black** piece.” (*A Plastic Ocean*, 47:18)

4.  “Social plastic is really our way that we can create an **organic, global** infrastructure.”
