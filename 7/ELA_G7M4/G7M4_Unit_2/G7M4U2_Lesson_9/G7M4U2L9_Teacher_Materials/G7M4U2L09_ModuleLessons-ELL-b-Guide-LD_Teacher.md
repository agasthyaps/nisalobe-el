5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

W.7.1b, L.7.2a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

An article by Jessica Hullinger in *The Week* magazine **mentions a few different, better alternatives for plastic.** (from paragraph 2 of Model Argument Essay: “Reduce Plastic Pollution in the Beginning of Its Lifecycle”)

**Lesson 9 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after students analyze the model essay in Work TIme A.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target (**I can write Proof Paragraph 1 of my pair argument essay using logical reasoning and relevant evidence from the text to support my point**) and W.7.1b by providing an example of a sentence within a Proof Paragraph of a model essay that introduces relevant evidence to support a point. The sentence also helps students to address L.7.2a because it contains coordinate adjectives. Supporting standard: L.7.1a.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses coordinate adjectives with the purpose of describing alternatives for plastic. It also uses a noun phrase functioning as the subject of the sentence to provide an in-text citation.

- Transfer: Students use coordinate adjectives to provide relevant evidence, examples, and details when writing the pair argument essay and when writing an argument essay in the End of Unit 2 Assessment.
