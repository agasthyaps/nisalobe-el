Final Debate Planner

SL.7.3, SL.7.4

(For Teacher Reference)

**Note to teacher:** Write student names in the chart. Consult students’ sticky notes from Lesson 3, and honor requests as much as possible. Conduct two separate debates, if necessary for your class, in order to give each student a role. (If so, copy this planner to create two separate debate groupings.) Some roles, such as cross-examiner and responder, can be easily shared. Roles of position presenter and summarizer could be shared if students work together to determine who will present which parts.
