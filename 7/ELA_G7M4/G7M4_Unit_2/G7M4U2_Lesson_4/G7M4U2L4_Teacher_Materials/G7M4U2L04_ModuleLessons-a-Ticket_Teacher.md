Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 4

W.7.1

(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, write a quick argument paragraph on where in the plastic life cycle (the beginning or middle) you can impact the most change. Write as much as you can in 5 minutes, remembering to include

- a claim,

- an alternative or opposing claim,

- logical reasoning and relevant evidence,

- argument transition words and phrases, and

- a concluding statement that follows from and supports the argument presented.

Responses will vary, but may include: The best place to impact change is at the very beginning of the plastic life cycle. Some people might say that the middle or end of the life cycle is better, but I think it’s the beginning, before more plastic has been made to litter our Earth. According to marine biologist Kerry Howell, “Human litter is present in all marine habitats” (*Trash Vortex* 44). The best thing to do, then, is to stop making more plastic and to ban single-use plastic. If we don’t stop the plastic problem before it starts, the problem will continue to spiral out of control.
