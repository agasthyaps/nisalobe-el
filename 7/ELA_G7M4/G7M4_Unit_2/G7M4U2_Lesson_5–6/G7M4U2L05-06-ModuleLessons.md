Plastic Pollution

Grade 7: Module 4: Unit 2: Lessons 5–6

Lesson Overview

Lesson Summary

Students complete their mid-unit assessment by reading a new article, “Boyan Slat: The Great Pacific Garbage Patch Kid,” and answering selected and constructed response questions to analyze the development of central idea, author’s point of view and purpose, and how authors present evidence differently. Students also participate in a Language Dive about the author’s point of view and purpose. Students close the lesson with a formal debate on which part of the plastic life cycle is best for reducing plastic pollution.

Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.7.6 – Work Time C: In a Language Dive, students analyze a sentence from the article “Boyan Slat: The Great Pacific Garbage Patch Kid” that expresses the author’s point of view.

- SL.7.3 – Closing and Assessment A: In a debate, students delineate a speaker’s argument and specific claims, evaluating the soundness of the reasoning and the relevance and sufficiency of the evidence.

- SL.7.4 – Closing and Assessment A: In a debate, students present claims and findings, emphasizing salient points in a focused, coherent manner with key descriptions, facts, details, and examples, and use appropriate eye contact, adequate volume, and clear pronunciation.

- For the mid-unit assessment in Work Time A of this lesson, students complete selected and constructed response questions to analyze the author’s development of central ideas and point of view. (RI.7.2, RI.7.6) Then students analyze how different authors writing about plastic pollution shape their presentations of key information by emphasizing different evidence or advancing different interpretations of facts. (RI.7.9, RI.7.10). Students also answer selected response questions on using word relationships to better understand the meaning of the words. (RI.7.4, L.7.4a, L.7.5, L.7.5b)

- Two lessons have been allocated to ensure students have sufficient time for the assessment and to debate which part of the plastic life cycle is the most effective place to effect change. If these are taught in two separate lessons rather than together as one block, revisit the learning targets and the task at the beginning of the second 45-minute lesson to remind students of the task and purpose.

- In this lesson, the habit of character focus is on working to become effective learners and ethical people and to contribute to a better world. On the assessment, students practice integrity and perseverance as they work independently. While tracking progress, students take responsibility as they assess their own work by tracking their progress on reading standards. In the debate, students persevere, collaborate, take initiative, take responsibility, and show respect. Lastly, they work to contribute to a better world by sharing their ideas about plastic pollution in an effort to help the environment.

- The Think-Pair-Share protocol is used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- Decide on the debate format, either one whole-class debate or, for larger classes, a fishbowl or two groups debating simultaneously.

- Directions for whole-class debate: There are twelve roles. Assign more than one student to the roles of cross-examiner and responder for each position (Beginning, Middle, and End of the plastic cycle). Act as moderator and conduct a full-class debate.

- Directions for the Fishbowl protocol: You may need to add an additional period in order to conduct both debates. Invite groups of twelve (one Beginning Group, one Middle Group, and one End Group) to debate in front of the rest of the class. Ask students on the outside circle to record stars and steps for students of their choosing, or assign students to provide feedback to a particular student in the center of the fishbowl. Students may use sticky notes to provide feedback. When one debate is complete, have the inner circle switch places with the outer circle.

- Directions for two groups debating simultaneously: If students are ready to conduct the debate somewhat independently, split the class into two groups to debate simultaneously. You may want to provide recording devices for the groups. If students are not ready to conduct the debate independently, add an additional period and moderate one group’s debate while the other group reads their independent research reading text or completes another independent activity. Then switch groups.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Encourage students to create their own reading tests and text-dependent questions using *Trash Vortex*, “Five Weird Materials That Could Replace Plastic” by Jessica Hullinger (*The Week*),” and “Five Things You Can Do to End Plastic Pollution,” by Anjali Acharya (*World Bank*).

- Ask students to create a how-to book for students in younger grades, explaining how to analyze the ways in which authors present information differently.

- Invite students to watch a presidential debate or listen to a debate podcast, such as American Public Square, and name the academic strengths as well as which habits of character and academic mindsets the debaters require to forward their argument.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the first half of this unit, students learned about the different aspects of the plastic life cycle and the different roles in a debate. They also learned how to analyze how authors can present information on the same topic differently in *Trash Vortex*, “Five Weird Materials That Could Replace Plastic” by Jessica Hullinger (*The Week*),” and “Five Things You Can Do to End Plastic Pollution,” by Anjali Acharya (*World Bank*). This lesson continues this analysis with a new article, “Boyan Slat: The Great Pacific Garbage Patch Kid,” in an assessment and culminates with a debate utilizing all the texts studied.

Support All Students

- The subject matter in this article includes a discussion of plastic pollution and its environmental impact on animals and humans. Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this poem that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually. To support students in processing this content, ask: “What habit of character did you use as you read and discussed this poem?” Students may need to draw on perseverance, empathy, and compassion as they read and discuss this content, being sensitive to their own and others’ reactions to the information presented.

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment. ▲

- For some students, this assessment may require more than the 40 minutes allotted. Provide time over multiple days if necessary. ▲

- Some students may still require the following supports for the assessment, but most students should be able to complete the assessment without them. If necessary, situate students so those who need these supports can access them: academic word wall and domain-specific word wall, Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart, Strategies to Answer Selected Response Questions anchor chart, and print or online dictionaries. ▲

- To support ELLs, the assessment in this lesson consists of tasks and questions in the same format as the activities students have completed throughout the unit thus far. This gradual release supports students in independent achievement on this assessment.

- ELLs may find it challenging to read the new article, “Boyan Slat: The Great Pacific Garbage Patch Kid.” Remind students of their reading strategies, such as reading the article through once for a general impression, then reading each paragraph slowly and recording a gist. Provide dictionaries for students to consult in determining the meaning of key unfamiliar vocabulary. Students may need additional time to read the article.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, 7.I.B.6, 7.I.B.9, 7.I.C.9, and 7.I.C.11.

Assessment Guidance

- All assessment materials (student prompt and teacher checklist) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback on this assessment, use the answer key and sample student responses (see Assessment Overview and Resources) to help complete students’ Track Progress recording form.

- In this assessment, students are tracking progress toward anchor standards:

- R.1: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.

- R.4: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Interpret words and phrases as they are used in a text, including determining technical, connotative, and figurative meanings, and analyze how specific word choices shape meaning or tone.

- R.10: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Read and comprehend complex literary and informational texts independently and proficiently.

- L.4: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Determine or clarify the meaning of unknown and multiple-meaning words and phrases by using context clues, analyzing meaningful word parts, and consulting general and specialized reference materials, as appropriate.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will study a model argument essay in order to prepare for writing their own pair and independent argument essays on plastic pollution. Students’ Mid-Unit 2 Assessments will be returned in Lessons 14–15 with feedback.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Return students’ **Module 4 End of Unit 1 Assessments with feedback**, and allow students time to review feedback and write their name on the board if they require support.

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lessons 5–6**. Students may choose whether to share their goals for this assessment with a partner or the class.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Mid-Unit 2 Assessment: Analyze How Authors Present Evidence Differently (40 minutes)

- Review appropriate learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze how authors treat the same topic differently by looking at how they present evidence and interpret facts.”

- Distribute **Mid-Unit 2 Assessment: Analyze How Authors Present Evidence Differently** and **Text: “Boyan Slat: The Great Pacific Garbage Patch Kid.”** Tell students that for this assessment, they will read the article and answer questions about it to analyze how the author presents evidence differently than it was presented in *Trash Vortex* and “Five Weird Materials That Could Replace Plastic.”

- Read the directions for each part of the assessment aloud as students to follow along. Answer clarifying questions.

- Before students begin the assessment, ask them to Think-Pair-Share:

“What value does the task of a reading assessment have for you beyond this class? Why?” (Responses will vary. Possible response: This task has a lot of value for me because I will have to take reading assessments and analyze articles in most of my high school and college classes.)

“What will help you succeed on this assessment?” (Responses will vary. Possible response: Using my strategies to answer selected-response questions will help me succeed in this task.)

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence. Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart** and review *perseverance*, *taking initiative*, and *taking responsibility*. Remind students that because they will be reading and answering questions independently for the assessment, they will need to practice these habits.

- Invite students to begin the assessment.

- While they are taking the assessment, circulate to monitor and document their test-taking skills.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- Before the mid-unit assessment in Work Time A, challenge students to underline key vocabulary in the assessment directions as the class reads them aloud. Also, invite students who need lighter support to restate or clarify information for students who need heavier support. These supports ensure that students understand the assessment.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time A, display a “map” of the assessment to reference while explaining directions to the mid-unit assessment. This will reduce ambiguity and give students a clearer picture of what they can expect so that they can better allocate their time and attention. Provide students with colored pencils or highlighters so that they can mark up the map as needed. Example:

- Read the article several times for comprehension.

- Read each question and each possible answer.

- Cross out incorrect answers.

- Select the best answer to the question.

- Repeat steps 3–5 for each question in the assessment.

- To help students manage their time during the mid-unit assessment, display on the board or on a poster suggested times at which students move on to the next question. Allocate the most time to reading the article.

Work Time

B. Track Progress (10 minutes)

- Give students specific, positive feedback on their completion of the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment.

- Distribute the **Track Progress folders**, **Track Progress: Read, Understand, and Explain New Text**, and several blank **sticky notes** for each student.

- Focus students on the Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart. Remind students that they will take responsibility for their own learning as they track their progress.

- Distribute sticky notes so students can mark up their work with evidence. Tell students the sticky notes are for them to find evidence in their assessment work of the following criteria:

- RI.7.4, L.7.4

- RI.7.10

- Guide students through completing the recording form.

- Incorporate reflection on and awareness of the following academic mindsets: “I can succeed at this,” and “My ability and competence grow with my effort.”

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What helped you to be successful at that task? How much effort did you put in on this task? How did your effort affect your learning?” (Possible responses: I was successful at that task because I focused and worked hard. I also understood what I was doing and what was being asked of me, which helped me succeed as well.)

Work Time

C. Language Dive: “Boyan Slat: The Great Pacific Garbage Patch Kid” – RI.7.6 (10 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to facilitate a Language Dive with the following lines from the article:

- “His story reminds us that creative ideas come from people of all ages and that kids really can change the world.”

- Use the accompanying materials to facilitate the Language Dive:

- **Language Dive Guide: “Boyan Slat: The Great Pacific Garbage Patch Kid” (for teacher reference)**

- **Language Dive: “Boyan Slat: The Great Pacific Garbage Patch Kid” Sentence Chunk Chart (for teacher reference)**

- **Language Dive: “Boyan Slat: The Great Pacific Garbage Patch Kid” sentence chunk strips**

- **Language Dive: “Boyan Slat: The Great Pacific Garbage Patch Kid” note-catcher (example for teacher reference)**

- **Language Dive: “Boyan Slat: The Great Pacific Garbage Patch Kid” note-catcher**

For Lighter Support

- During the Language Dive of Work Time C, students analyze a sentence from the article “Boyan Slat: The Great Pacific Garbage Patch Kid” to analyze the author’s point of view. Invite ELLs to remind their classmates who need heavier support about what point of view is. (an author’s opinion or perspective on a topic) Encourage students to give examples. (In *Trash Vortex*, the author’s point of view on plastic is that it is bad for the ocean.) They can share these examples with classmates who need heavier support. Additional practice in identifying, interpreting, and explaining point of view will improve students’ language acquisition, speaking, and listening skills.

For Heavier Support

- During the Language Dive of Work Time C, some students may need additional support as they complete the sentence frame in the Practice section (His story reminds us that \_\_\_\_\_). Ask students to work together to generate a list of what Boyan Slat’s story reminds us about (kids can make a difference; people can make a change; people are trying to solve the plastic pollution problem; kids have good ideas about solving plastic pollution; etc.) As necessary, model using a student-generated idea to complete the sentence frame: His story reminds us that kids can make a difference.

Closing and Assessment

A. Debate Plastic Life Cycle – SL.7.3, SL.7.4 (25 minutes)

- Review appropriate learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can delineate and evaluate a speaker’s claims.”

“I can present my claims in a clear way, supported by evidence.”

- Display and ask students to retrieve their copies of the **Debate Directions** to review the debate scenario.

- Remind students that they are responsible for convincing an advertising agency to design a commercial about plastic pollution. The advertising agency would like to choose a particular part of the plastic life cycle to focus on. The agency will hear this debate to decide how to proceed with the commercial. Explain that students should present their position based on the prompt they have been examining throughout the unit:

“Which part of the plastic life cycle is the best place to target to reduce plastic pollution?”

- Direct students to retrieve their **Prepare for Debate note-catcher** or, if this was not completed for homework, their **Beginning, Middle**, and **End of Debate note-catchers**. Students can then move to their position groups (beginning, middle, or end). Allow a few minutes for students to share their notes and craft their position statement as a group. If time allows, students can practice their portion of the debate for their group. Remind students to use appropriate eye contact and to speak clearly and with adequate volume. Invite groups to offer stars and steps. Give students a few minutes to revise their notes based on peer feedback.

- Decide on the debate format, either one whole-class debate, a fishbowl, or two smaller group debates. See Teaching Notes for suggestions on each of these options. Discuss the directions and invite notices, wonders, questions, and comments. Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“Which norms, character traits, and academic mindsets will be important during the debate?” (Responses will vary but may include: listening respectfully, collaborating with my group, responding respectfully, using a respectful tone of voice, speaking with appropriate volume and eye contact, believing that the debate has value for us.)

- Inform students that as the teacher, you will perform the role of the moderator. Begin the debate with a statement such as the following:

“The debate on which part of the plastic life cycle advertisers should focus on will begin now. I call the beginning position presenter to start the debate.”

- Proceed through the steps on the Debate Directions. When the debate draws to a close, consider closing the debate with a statement such as the following:

“The debate on which part of the plastic life cycle advertisers should support has drawn to a close. I want to thank all of you for your insightful comments and respectful demeanor.”

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- In Closing and Assessment A, ensure that students are strategically grouped to best support them in participating in the debate. This may mean mixed groupings by language or content proficiency. However, ensure that there is no more than one level of difference among the students in a group. Strategic grouping affords students the opportunity of supporting and being challenged by others.

- At the end of the lesson, encourage students to take a few moments to reflect on their learning. Use the following questions to prompt reflection:

- What have you learned about plastic pollution? about different solutions and points of the plastic life cycle? About how authors use evidence differently?

- What new vocabulary or language structures did you learn in this unit?

- Encourage students to share the most important or exciting thing they learned in this unit. Reflecting on learning allows students to more firmly grasp abstract concepts and gives them confidence and ownership over their own learning.

For Heavier Support

- See For Lighter Support. Additionally, group students who need heavier support by home language and encouraging them to use their home language in their preparations.

- See For Lighter Support. Use the following questions to prompt students who need heavier support in their reflection:

- What have you learned about plastic pollution? What are the different points in the plastic life cycle? What are some solutions for plastic pollution? What did you learn about how authors use evidence?

- What new vocabulary or language structures did you learn in this unit?

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
