Mid-Unit 2 Assessment: Analyze How Authors Present Evidence Differently

**Name:** **Date:**

**Directions:** Read the article “Boyan Slat: The Great Pacific Garbage Patch Kid.” (RI.7.10) Then respond to each question by underlining the correct response.

1.  This question has two parts. First answer Part A, then answer Part B.

**Part A**

What are two central ideas of the article “Boyan Slat: The Great Pacific Garbage Patch Kid”? (Select two.) (RI.7.2)

2.  Plastic pollution is a big issue in our world today.

3.  People can see plastic in the ocean just by swimming.

4.  Plastic in the ocean breaks down into tiny pieces over time.

5.  A young inventor has created a new way to clean up the oceans.

6.  Many people are working on different ideas to combat pollution.

**Part B**

How does the author develop these central ideas? (Select one.) (RI.7.2)

1.  by listing the animals affected by plastic pollution

<!-- -->

7.  by sharing personal stories about discovering plastic solution

8.  by quoting scientists who describe how plastic changes over time

9.  by describing the problem and sharing the story of someone’s solution

10. This question has two parts. First answer Part A, then answer Part B.

**Part A**

What is the author’s point of view about the experiment that is explained in the article? (RI.7.6)

11. It is too complex for most people to understand.

12. It is an exciting new approach to cleaning up the ocean.

13. It is influencing people to use less plastic in their daily lives.

14. It is probably too late to make an impact on plastic pollution.

**Part B**

Which sentence best expresses that point of view? (RI.7.6)

1.  “Plastics are polluting the oceans, rivers, and beaches of the world, and studies show that even the tiniest pieces pose a large threat.”

<!-- -->

15. “We’re mismanaging our waste, and that’s coming back to haunt us on our own dinner plates and in our drinking water.”

16. “Boyan imagines that eventually, up to 60 devices that will ride the waves, collecting thousands of tons of debris a year.”

17. “His story reminds us that creative ideas come from people of all ages and that kids really can change the world.”

18. Reread this excerpt from *Trash Vortex* and answer the question that follows.

“Could a vacuum cleaner suck up the plastic from the ocean surface the way a home vacuum cleans a carpet? Designers of a solar-powered, floating vacuum think so. Others believe ocean currents will naturally push and gather plastic against plastic barriers, where it can be transported to land for recycling. But Australian ecologist Chris Wilcox worries that ‘it would be as if you were vacuuming your living room, and I’m standing at the doorway with a bag of dust and a fan. You can constantly keep vacuuming, but you could never catch up.’” (44–46)

How does the author shape her presentation of the evidence differently from the author of the article “Boyan Slat: The Great Pacific Garbage Patch Kid”? (RI.7.9)

19. by including statistics about how much plastic pollution exists

20. by quoting experts who are more skeptical of the cleanup idea

21. by explaining how the idea for a vacuum first came to the researchers

22. by suggesting that plastic pollution is less of a problem than some think

23. Reread this excerpt from “Five Weird Materials That Could Replace Plastic,” and answer the question that follows.

“That’s a bummer, but even worse is that a lot of our discarded plastic doesn’t wind up in a landfill at all. Instead, it lands in the ocean, with one study suggesting as much as 8 million metric tons of plastic found its way to the ocean in 2010. That’s ‘five plastic bags filled with plastic for every foot of coastline in the world,’ says Jenna Jambeck, an associate professor at the University of Georgia and an author on the study.

“Okay, enough doom and gloom. Here’s the good news: Scientists know this is a problem, and are working hard to find a solution. Here are a few recent attempts.”

How does this author’s presentation of the evidence compare with the article “Boyan Slat: The Great Pacific Garbage Patch Kid”? (RI.7.9)

24. Both authors believe that plastic pollution has already been solved.

25. Both authors suggest that plastic pollution will not be solved in our lifetimes.

26. Both authors describe problems of plastic pollution but emphasize different solutions.

27. Both authors talk about possible solutions but only one of them describes the solution in detail.

28. Reread the excerpt from the article and answer the question that follows.

“The creative teen has an idea. Instead of going after the plastic, he will create a ‘passive concentration system.’ In this system, the ocean currents bring the plastic to him.”  
(RI.7.4, L.7.4a)

What is the meaning of the phrase “passive concentration system” in this excerpt?

29. a device for measuring the plastic in the ocean

30. a way of collecting plastic without using energy

31. a method for making the tiny plastic pieces larger

32. a person who provides solutions to problems found in the oceans

33. In the following excerpt, underline the best synonym for the word **pollutants**. (L.7.5b)

“Some may develop tumors or liver damage because the plastics are sponges for soaking up **pollutants** such as mercury, flame retardants, and pesticides. These toxins make their way up the food chain.”

34. Reread the excerpt below and answer the question that follows:

“What to do about the **confetti soup** of plastics in our oceans?” (L.7.5b)

What does the phrase **confetti soup** help to explain about the kinds of plastic in the ocean?

35. It shows why cleaning it up is fun.

36. It suggests many tiny pieces together.

37. It emphasizes that fish eat the plastic.

38. It reminds people to clean up after parties.
