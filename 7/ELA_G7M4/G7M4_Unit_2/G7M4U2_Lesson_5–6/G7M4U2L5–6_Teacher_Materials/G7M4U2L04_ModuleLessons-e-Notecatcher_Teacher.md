(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** If you are presenting, use this note-catcher to prepare your thoughts for your assigned position and part of the presentation. If you are listening to another group, use this note-catcher to keep track of their argument so that you can raise appropriate questions and counterarguments during cross-examination, and also have a record of each position.

**Debate Question:** Which part of the plastic life cycle is the best place to target to reduce plastic pollution?

**Present the Position**

*Note to teacher: Possible responses listed in full sentences for use in presenting the position; student notes can be in incomplete sentences.*

Background

Plastic pollution has become an undeniable problem. According to Anjali Acharya from the *World Bank* article, “plastic products wash up daily on beaches worldwide” and “waterways in cities are increasingly clogged with plastic waste.” Clearly, something needs to be done. There are many approaches to reducing plastic pollution. We can focus our energy on the beginning, middle, or end of the plastic life cycle. Each part is important.

Claim

If we are serious about solving the problem of plastic pollution, the simplest and most effective place to focus our energy is the end of the life cycle.

Reason

At the end of the life cycle, inventors, companies, and governments have the power to clean up plastic pollution.

Evidence and Reasoning

As one marine biologist explains in *Trash Vortex*, “Human litter is present in all marine habitats, from beaches to the most remote and deepest parts of the ocean” (44). This means that the problem already exists in the ocean, and to fix it, we will need to start cleaning up plastic. Inventors and companies can create new solutions to clean up plastic from the ocean and from waterways. Pat Betteley writes about how Boyan Slat, a young man from the Netherlands, has come up with a new idea to clean up the oceans. He has developed a “passive concentration system” that will “bring the plastic to him.” This idea shows that it is possible to reduce plastic pollution by simply cleaning it up.

Restated Claim

The end of the plastic life cycle is the best place to reduce plastic pollution because there is already so much plastic pollution, and people are coming up with ideas to do something about it. By taking steps to clean up the plastic that already exists, we will target plastic pollution in the most direct and efficient way.

**Cross-Examination Questions**

Responses will vary, but may include:

1\. You mentioned \_\_\_\_; why do you think that is the most helpful solution?

2\. You mentioned \_\_\_\_, but what about \_\_\_\_?

3\. What other evidence do you have to support your case?

4\. Can you say more about \_\_\_\_?

**Rebuttal and Summary**

Restated Claim

Although steps can be taken at the other parts of the plastic life cycle, the end remains the most effective place to target.

Restated Evidence and Reason

The plastic that already exists in the ocean is causing great harm to the environment and to sea life. By targeting this pollution, we can reduce it directly.

Counterclaim Acknowledgment

Other groups have brought up the objection that we may not be able to develop technologies to clean up plastic from the ocean.

Refutation (New Evidence and Reasoning)

While it is true that we don’t currently have the ability to clean up all the plastic from the ocean, inventors like Boyan Slat are coming up with good ideas to collect plastic. As more energy goes into this part of the life cycle, it seems very likely that more solutions will follow.

Restated Claim and Brief Reflection

Although others have raised interesting points, the end of the plastic life cycle is still the best place to target to reduce plastic pollution. The best solution to this problem is to make sure that the plastic that is already doing damage to our environment is taken out of it as soon as possible.
