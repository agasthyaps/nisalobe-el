(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** If you are presenting, use this note-catcher to prepare your thoughts for your assigned position and part of the presentation. If you are listening to another group, use this note-catcher to keep track of the argument the group is making. This will support you in raising appropriate questions and counterarguments during cross-examination, and also provide a record of each position.

**Debate Question:** Which part of the plastic life cycle is the best place to target to reduce plastic pollution?

**Present the Position**

**Note to teacher: Possible responses listed in full sentences for use in presenting the position; student notes can be in incomplete sentences.**

Background

Plastic pollution has become an undeniable problem. According to Anjali Acharya from the World Bank, “plastic products wash up daily on beaches worldwide” and “waterways in cities are increasingly clogged with plastic waste.” Clearly, something needs to be done. There are many approaches to reducing plastic pollution. We can focus our energy on the beginning, middle, or end of the plastic life cycle. Each part is important.

Claim

If we are serious about solving the problem of plastic pollution, the simplest and most effective place to focus our energy is at the beginning of the life cycle.

Reason

At the beginning of the life cycle, inventors, companies, and governments have the power to reduce the amount of plastic that goes into the environment.

Evidence and Reasoning

Inventors and companies can create new material to replace plastic: As Jessica Hullinger reports in *The Week*, “Scientists know this is a problem, and are working hard to find a solution.” The solutions she proposes include biodegradable material made from shrimp shells and mushrooms. Exciting stuff! Unlike plastic, these materials can decompose safely in the environment, so using them instead of plastic would be a great benefit. Governments and communities also have the power to reduce plastic pollution, by banning the sale of single-use plastics. As Danielle Smith-Llera writes in *Trash Vortex*, “\[m\]ore than 200 U.S. cities have banned plastic bags and so have such countries as Kenya, China, Rwanda, and France” (51). This shows that governments and communities have the power to stop plastic pollution before it starts.

Restated Claim

Banning plastic and inventing new materials at the beginning of the plastic life cycle are the best solutions for reducing plastic pollution. By taking these steps, we make sure plastic never enters the world in the first place, and therefore can never become harmful to our environment.

Cross-Examination Questions

Responses will vary, but may include:

1\. You mentioned \_\_\_\_; why do you think that is the most helpful solution?

2\. You mentioned \_\_\_\_, but what about \_\_\_\_?

3\. What other evidence do you have to support your position?

4\. Can you say more about \_\_\_\_?

Rebuttal and Summary

**Note to teacher: Completed in Lesson 3.**

Restated Claim

Although steps can be taken at the other parts of the plastic life cycle, the beginning remains the most effective place to target.

Restated Evidence and Reason

We discussed how the beginning of the plastic life cycle was the best place to effect change because inventors, companies, and governments have the power to reduce plastic pollution by inventing new material or banning plastic from being made in the first place.

Counterclaim Acknowledgment

Other groups have brought up the objections that there isn’t a perfect material to replace plastic and that not all governments are willing to ban single-use plastic.

Refutation (New Evidence and Reasoning)

While that may be true right now, it is only because we have not put our time and energy into making sure that less plastic enters the environment in the first place. By focusing our energy on the beginning of the plastic life cycle, we can provide incentives to make new materials more quickly. Also, by talking to people in the government, we can start to persuade them to ban plastic before it becomes a problem.

Restated Claim and Brief Reflection

Although others have raised interesting points, the beginning of the plastic life cycle is still the best place to target to reduce plastic pollution. The best solution to this problem is to make sure that less plastic gets into the environment in the first place.
