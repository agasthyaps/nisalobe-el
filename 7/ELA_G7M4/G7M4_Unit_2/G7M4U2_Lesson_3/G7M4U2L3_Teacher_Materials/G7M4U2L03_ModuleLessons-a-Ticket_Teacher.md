(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, complete the following prompt.

What are some of the further ideas or examples you found about the middle of the plastic life cycle from *Trash Vortex*?

Responses will vary, but may include: The author explains on pages 22–23 how “Plentiful and affordable plastics helped shape a new lifestyle.” But this also came with a new danger, since people were quicker to throw plastics away rather than washing them or reusing them. The author talks about how people were “drinking coffee from foam cups instead of ceramic ones” (23). But on page 50 the author also talks about how “every day people fight the war on plastic pollution. They drink from refillable water bottles and take cloth bags to fill at the grocery store” (50–51). These show clear examples of people fighting plastic pollution at the middle of its life cycle.
