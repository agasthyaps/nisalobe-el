<td><p><em>The Week</em>:</p>
<p>“Hidden underneath a mushroom’s outer shell is a complex system of tubular cells called mycelia. These are fungi’s eyes and ears; they sense the surrounding environment, absorb nutrients as food, and help the fungus grow and survive. They look a bit like fine, white hair, and they’re the secret ingredient in a new kind of fungus-based packing material. A company called Ecovative Design is mixing natural ingredients (like oats or hemp) with the mycelia, which grows and binds the mixture together into a solid mat. Put these mats into a mold, and voila: You’ve got a container, carton, or canister that’s eco-friendly. According to <em>Phys.org</em>, this mushroom material can break down in a landfill in about 180 days.”</p></td>

<tr class="even">
<td colspan="2"><p>How do the authors present evidence about the biodegradable materials differently?</p>
<p>The author of <em>Trash Vortex</em> presents evidence that biodegradable materials <strong>did not live up to their promise.</strong> She writes that biodegradable materials <strong>“need certain temperatures and exposure to sunlight” in order to biodegrade and so took as long as “petroleum-based” plastics.</strong> The author of the article in <em>The Week</em> talks about a new material made from <strong>a mushroom.</strong> She claims that this material can <strong>“break down in a landfill in about 180 days.”</strong></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td colspan="2"><p>How does the information the authors choose to include affect their interpretations of the facts about biodegradable materials?</p>
<p>The information that the author of <em>Trash Vortex</em> chooses to include leads her to an interpretation that <strong>biodegradable materials will not necessarily solve the problem, “[s]o recycling continues.”</strong> However, the author of the article in <em>The Week</em> <strong>is more optimistic as she describes how the material is made and includes the claim that it will “break down in a landfill in about 180 days” without challenging the claim.</strong></p></td>

<td><p><em>World Bank</em>:</p>
<p>“This year, World Environment Day focuses on ‘Beating Plastic Pollution.’ The World Bank is contributing to this effort, using our suite of lending instruments and policy dialogue with key countries and cities to help identify and finance solutions to address the marine plastics issue. For example, the World Bank is a long term strategic investor in the improvement of municipal solid waste management systems that, if not correctly managed, are a major contributor to the ocean plastics problem. Since 2000, the World Bank has invested over $4.5 billion to help improve more than 300 solid waste management programs to reduce pollution leakage, including plastics, into our environment. The Bank is also studying the flow of plastics into the ocean through a series of plastics pollution hotspot analyses to prioritize investments and look for quick wins.</p>
<p>But it is going to take more than building better solid waste management systems. Everyone needs to be on board to solve this problem and individual actions count.”</p></td>

<td colspan="2"><p>How do the authors present evidence about the effect of improving waste management and recycling efforts differently?</p>
<p>She tells how these programs help . . .</p>
<p>The author of <em>Trash Vortex</em> says clearly that <strong>“Simply finding new ways to recycle plastic cannot solve the problem.”</strong> She includes a quote from <strong>an oceanographer to explain why recycling plastic from the ocean does not solve the issue.</strong> She also points out that <strong>microplastics in the Arctic come “from all over the world” (48).</strong> The author of the <em>World Bank</em> article writes about <strong>the work that the World Bank does to help countries with their solid waste management systems. She explains that these programs help “reduce pollution leakage, including plastics, into our environment.”</strong> She also writes that <strong>the focus on “plastics pollution hotspot[s]” could result in “quick wins.”</strong></p></td>

<td colspan="2"><p>How does the information the authors choose to include affect their interpretations of the facts about waste management and recycling?</p>
<p><strong>Both authors acknowledge that recycling is good, but will not solve the plastic pollution problem by itself.</strong> The author of <em>Trash Vortex</em> ends this section by explaining that <strong>the U.N. has called for a ban on plastic pollution, and quoting the environment director from that organization explaining the ban.</strong> The writer of the <em>World Bank</em> article acknowledges that <strong>solving plastic pollution is “going to take more than building better solid waste management systems.”</strong> She calls for “everyone” to <strong>“be on board” to help and points out that “individual actions count.”</strong></p></td>
