**Directions:** With your group, answer the following questions about the same excerpts from your note-catchers in Work Time A. The first three questions are about the excerpt from *The Week* and page 49 of *Trash Vortex*. Questions 4–6 are about the excerpt from *World Bank* and page 48 of *Trash Vortex*.

1.  What is the excerpt from *The Week* mostly about?

2.  the risks of the new mushroom material

3.  <u>the nature of the new mushroom material</u>

4.  the difficulty of disposing of the new mushroom material

5.  the complexity of developing the new mushroom material

6.  Which sentence best conveys the author’s view about how this new material will affect the environment?

7.  “Hidden underneath a mushroom’s outer shell is a complex system of tubular cells called mycelia.

8.  “They look a bit like fine, white hair, and they’re the secret ingredient in a new kind of fungus-based packing material.”

9.  “A company called Ecovative Design is mixing natural ingredients (like oats or hemp) with the mycelia, which grows and binds the mixture together into a solid mat.”

10. <u>“Put these mats into a mold, and voila: You’ve got a container, carton, or canister that’s eco-friendly. According to *Phys.org*, this mushroom material can break down in a landfill in about 180 days.”</u>

11. How does the author of *Trash Vortex* shape her presentation of the environmental effects of new materials differently?

12. by listing ways that people can reuse plastic

13. by describing how new materials are invented

14. by explaining why plastic is not as harmful as many think

15. <u>by focusing on the special conditions certain materials needed to biodegrade</u>

16. This question has two parts. First, answer Part A. Then, answer Part B.

**Part A**

What is the excerpt from the World Bank’s blog post mostly about?

17. the costs of developing new materials

18. the dangers of relying on recycling too much

19. the reasons that people use so much plastic worldwide

20. <u>the investments being made to improve waste management systems</u>

**Part B**

How does this focus shape the excerpt’s presentation of plastic pollution?

1.  by calling into question whether people understand plastic pollution

<!-- -->

21. by providing evidence that more people recycle than previously thought

22. <u>by suggesting the benefits of improving the places where plastic is disposed of</u>

23. by implying that plastic pollution can be more easily solved than previously realized

24. How does the excerpt from *Trash Vortex* present a different interpretation about the effectiveness of targeting how plastic pollution is disposed of?

25. by focusing on the difficulty of making plastic

26. by explaining why most plastic is not recycled

27. <u>by providing quotes that emphasize the need to clean up the existing plastic</u>

28. by introducing research that shows why people prefer to reuse plastic instead of recycling it

29. In the table below, underline one sentence from each excerpt that shows the authors expressing a similar view about the effectiveness of only addressing how plastic is disposed of.
