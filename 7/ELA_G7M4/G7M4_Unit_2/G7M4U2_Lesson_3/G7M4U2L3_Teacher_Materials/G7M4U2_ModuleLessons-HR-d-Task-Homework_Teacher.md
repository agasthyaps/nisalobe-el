Homework: Understand Word  
Relationships: “Five Things You Can Do  
to End Plastic Pollution”

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Read the excerpts from the article “Five Things You Can Do to End Plastic Pollution.” Then answer the questions that follow.

1.  Read the excerpt, and answer the questions that follow.

“Over the last two decades, more and more countries and cities are either banning plastic bags (examples include Rwanda, California) or introducing **levies** and **taxes** on them (examples include Ireland, Washington, D.C.) to discourage people from the plastic option.” (paragraph 6)

What are **taxes**? How can you use the meaning of **taxes** to better understand **levies**?

*Taxes* are money paid to the government on items. Since countries, cities, and states are introducing both levies and taxes, *levies* must also be money paid to the government.

2.  Read the excerpt, and answer the questions that follow.

“Keep a recyclable bottle in your bag, place two on your desk—a mug for the hot drink; a **tumbler**/**glass** for something cold.” (paragraph 7)

What is a **glass**? How can you use the meaning of **glass** to better understand **tumbler**?

A *glass* is a container used for drinking. A *tumbler* must also be a container used for drinking.

3.  Read the excerpt, and answer the questions that follow.

“Ordering take-out? Tell the vendor to skip the plastic **cutlery**. Catering events? Use reusable **cutlery** (and **plates and cups**).” (paragraph 9)

What other items could be associated with **plates and cups** for takeout or events? What is **cutlery**? Hint: Use both the relationship to **plates and cups** and word parts of **cutlery** to figure out the meaning of the word.

Other items that could be associated with *plates and cups* for takeout or events are napkins and forks, knives, and spoons. Using word parts and seeing *cut* in the word *cutlery*, I think *cutlery* must mean knives, forks, and spoons, because you use a knife and fork to cut things.

4.  Read the excerpt, and answer the questions that follow.

“**Microbeads**, a type of microplastic, are the little **dots** in your toothpaste, and facial scrubs.” (paragraph 10)

What are **dots**? How can you use the meaning of **dots** to better understand **microbeads**?

*Dots* are little marks or spots. *Microbeads* must be little marks or spots.
