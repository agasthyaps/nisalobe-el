<p>“Hidden underneath a mushroom’s outer shell is a complex system of tubular cells called mycelia. These are fungi’s eyes and ears; they sense the surrounding environment, absorb nutrients as food, and help the fungus grow and survive. They look a bit like fine, white hair, and they’re the secret ingredient in a new kind of fungus-based packing material. A company called Ecovative Design is mixing natural ingredients (like oats or hemp) with the mycelia, which grows and binds the mixture together into a solid mat. Put these mats into a mold, and voila: You’ve got a container, carton, or canister that’s eco-friendly. According to <em>Phys.org</em>, this mushroom material can break down in a landfill in about 180 days.”</p></td>

<td><p><em>World Bank</em>:</p>
<p>“This year, World Environment Day focuses on ‘Beating Plastic Pollution.’ The World Bank is contributing to this effort, using our suite of lending instruments and policy dialogue with key countries and cities to help identify and finance solutions to address the marine plastics issue. For example, the World Bank is a long term strategic investor in the improvement of municipal solid waste management systems that, if not correctly managed, are a major contributor to the ocean plastics problem. Since 2000, the World Bank has invested over $4.5 billion to help improve more than 300 solid waste management programs to reduce pollution leakage, including plastics, into our environment. The Bank is also studying the flow of plastics into the ocean through a series of plastics pollution hotspot analyses to prioritize investments and look for quick wins.</p>
<p>But it is going to take more than building better solid waste management systems. Everyone needs to be on board to solve this problem and individual actions count.”</p></td>
