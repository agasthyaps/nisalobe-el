| People have suggested buying less plastic at the middle of the plastic life cycle or inventing new ways to clean up plastic at the end of the life cycle.                                                                                                                                                                |
| These efforts are helpful, but the most effective place to reduce plastic pollution is at the beginning of its life cycle. By inventing and using new materials and placing strict bans on plastic, we can help ensure a future that is free of plastic pollution.                                                       |
| It’s easy to forget about plastic once you’re done using it, but the problem doesn’t go away. A plastic bottle could be around for five hundred years before it starts to decay (Hullinger). One whale could swallow as many as 80 plastic bags (Acharya). We must take action to reduce the existing plastic pollution. |
