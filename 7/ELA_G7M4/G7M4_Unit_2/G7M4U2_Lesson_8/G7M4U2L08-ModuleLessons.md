Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- L.7.1c – Opening A: On an entrance ticket, students identify modifying phrases in the model argument essay.

- W.7.1a – Work Time A: Students use the Painted Essay® structure to more closely analyze a model introduction to note how it effectively introduces the topic and previews what is to follow.

- W.7.1a – Work Time B: Students participate in a Language Dive, analyzing the meaning of the model argument essay’s focus statement.

- W.7.1a – Closing and Assessment A: Students work in pairs to draft their introductions, introducing the topic with appropriate context and previewing what is to follow in a clear focus statement.

- In this lesson, students work to become effective learners, collaborating with peers and persevering to write an introduction.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release those students who are ready to read and analyze the model introduction independently and then move on to drafting the introduction to their practice essay with a partner rather than with teacher modeling.

- Use students’ introductions from previous years or find a set of argument introductions to use. Invite students to participate in a Gallery Walk protocol in which they read a variety of introductions posted around the room and record their notices about what makes the introductions strong. Be sure to debrief the protocol with a synthesis discussion of how to write a strong introduction.

- Challenge students to create and play a game in which they work with a partner to take turns stating claims and opposing claims.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lessons, students analyzed the structure of the model essay using the Painted Essay® template. The introduction is analyzed in detail so students can begin writing their own essays in this lesson.

Support All Students

- In Lessons 7–11, students work with the same partner on a pair argument essay. Provide differentiated mentors by purposefully preselecting student partnerships. Meet with the mentors in advance to encourage them to share their thought process with their partner. ▲

- Students may need additional support writing their introductions. Group those students, leading the discussion to guide them to make a claim and give context to the reader about plastic pollution. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson includes the use of manipulatives to understand the key structures of an argument essay introduction. Also, the collaboration of writing a pair essay introduction supports students in expressing their ideas.

- ELLs may find it challenging to generate language for writing their introduction. In addition to the supports below, encourage students to use oral processing and their home language to assist them in articulating their ideas.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, 7.I.B.6, 7.I.B.7, 7.I.B.8, 7.I.C.11, 7.I.C.12, 7.II.A.1, 7.II.B.3, and 7.II.B.4.

Assessment Guidance

- Use the Grade 7 Writing Process checklist to assess students’ writing abilities in Closing and Assessment A (see the Tools Page at http://eled.org/tools).

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will write Proof Paragraph 1 of their essays, drawing on the planning work in this and the previous lesson.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Ensure there is a copy of Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 8 at each student’s workspace.

- Organize the Model: Introduction strips (one strip per pair) for Work Time A. Or if desired, students can do this preparation at the start of the activity.

- Cut apart the introduction paragraph strips, and organize them using envelopes or paperclips so that each pair has one set.

- Review the Argument Writing checklist to become familiar with what will be required of students over the remainder of the unit.

- Determine pairs for work throughout the lesson, grouping students by writing or content proficiency.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous modules to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.7.1c (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 8**.

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique for students to share examples of modifying phrases from their entrance ticket work.

- Remind students that they have learned about these kinds of phrases and clauses in Language Dives throughout Modules 1–3. Inform students that they will continue to work with these phrases and clauses in homework and on entrance tickets for the next several lessons.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

- As necessary, use the vocabulary strategies on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart** to review with students the word *context* (background information necessary for understanding a topic). Record on the **academic word wall** with translations in home languages, where appropriate, and invite students to record words in their **vocabulary logs**.

For Lighter Support

- In Opening A, challenge students to grapple independently to identify modifying phrases and then share them with their pair essay writing partner. Encouraging students to grapple first promotes independence and allows students to self assess.

For Heavier Support

- In Opening A, pairs may benefit from working with other pairs who have more English language proficiency. If so, first allow pairs to review their homework and grapple to identify modifying phrases in the Model Argument Essay. Then encourage pairs who need heavier support to work with pairs with more English proficiency to review the homework and the modifying phrases from the model essay.

Work Time

A. The Painted Essay®: Sort and Color-Code the Parts of an Introduction – W.7.1a (15 minutes)

- Move students into predetermined pairs, and distribute **Organize the Model: Introduction strips**. Tell students that each pair has been given only one part of the introduction and that later they will find the other parts to create a complete introduction. Explain that there are three parts to this introduction: context, acknowledgement of an opposing claim, and main claim. Each pair needs to find pairs with the other two parts of the introduction. Then each group of six students should work together to identify each part of the introduction and to arrange all three parts of the introduction in an order that makes sense.

- Tell students that when they have finished, they can check their work against the **Model Argument Essay: “Reduce Plastic Pollution in the Beginning of Its Life Cycle”** and color-code their strips.

- Invite students to begin, and circulate to support students in reading and sorting the strips of the introduction. When the introduction has been assembled, invite groups to use the **Painted Essay® template** and **colored pencils** to underline each part of the introduction in the correct color: red for the context, yellow for Point 1, blue for Point 2, and green for the rest of the main claim of the piece.

- Support students with the **Organize the Model: Introduction strips (answers for teacher reference)** and the **Paint an Essay lesson plan (for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Refocus whole group. Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“How does the author begin the introduction of the essay? What is the purpose of the first part of the introduction?” (The introduction begins with some context about plastic pollution, which should be colored red.)

“What is the next part of the introduction? What is the purpose of the next sentence in the introduction?” (It acknowledges that there are other places in the life cycle we can target to reduce plastic pollution.)

Explain that this is called an “opposing claim”—a claim that could be made that is different from the writer’s main claim. In an argument, we want to acknowledge that other opinions are possible. In this introduction, the writer admits that there are other possible ways to reduce plastic pollution. Direct students to color this sentence red because it is part of the introduction and leads to the main claim.

“What is the last part of the introduction? What is the purpose of the last two sentences of the introduction?” (The last two sentences state the main claim of the piece and preview the two points. The first point should be yellow and the second blue. The rest of the claim should be green.)

- Ask if there were any groups that arranged their introductions differently than the model. Invite these groups to explain their thinking, noting that there isn’t only one correct way to assemble or write an introduction. Ask students to Turn and Talk:

“How is the introduction in the model similar to and different from the introduction to the last essay you wrote?” (Both provide context that helps the reader understand the topic. The points we will discuss are still there, but in this model, the opinion is stated in one sentence, and the two points the author will use to support the opinion are previewed in the next sentence. Also, in our literary argument essays, we used three points, but this essay has two points.)

- Invite students to chorally read the introduction in the model together as a class, stopping after each sentence to review its function in the paragraph. Invite students to help record or check the parts of an introduction on the displayed **Criteria of an Effective Argument Essay anchor chart.**

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time A, provide students with already color-coded parts of the paragraph so that they can focus on arranging the sentences in the order that makes the most sense.

Work Time

B. Language Dive: Model Essay, Main Claim – W.7.1a (10 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to facilitate a Language Dive with the following sentence from the model essay:

- “By inventing and using new materials and banning plastic as much as possible, we can help ensure a future that is free of plastic pollution.”

- Use the accompanying materials to facilitate the Language Dive:

- **Language Dive Guide: Model Argument Essay, Main Claim (for teacher reference)**

- **Language Dive: Model Argument Essay, Main Claim Sentence Chunk Chart (for teacher reference)**

- **Language Dive: Model Argument Essay, Main Claim note-catcher (example for teacher reference)**

- **Language Dive: Model Argument Essay, Main Claim sentence chunk strips**

- **Language Dive: Model Argument Essay, Main Claim note-catcher**

For Lighter Support

- During the Language Dive of Work Time B, students analyze the focus statement (which in this essay states the main claim). Invite students to remind classmates what makes a focus statement effective (using key words from the prompt and expressing the point of the essay). Challenge students to Turn and Talk to grapple with what makes an effective main claim statement (clearly expressing an opinion that can be supported with evidence). Explaining to others helps students confirm their knowledge of language structures.

For Heavier Support

- During the Language Dive of Work Time B, some students may need additional support as they complete the sentence frame in the Practice section. If so, display the habits of character anchor charts: Work to Become Effective Learners, Work to Become Ethical People, and Work to Make the World a Better Place. Model creating several sentences (e.g., By not giving up on a hard writing task, I demonstrate perseverance. By listening to others when they share, I demonstrate compassion.)

Closing and Assessment

A. Pair Writing: Draft an Introduction – W.7.1a (15 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can write an introduction for my essay giving context on plastic pollution, acknowledging an opposing claim, and clearly stating the main claim of the piece.”

- Remind students that they will be working in pairs to write an essay supporting the claim that we should reduce plastic pollution by targeting the end of the plastic life cycle. Display and invite students to retrieve their **Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer** and **Directions for Pair Argument Essay**. Also, display and distribute copies of the **Argument Writing checklist** and remind students that they used similar checklists in Modules 1 and 2 when they wrote informative essays. The specific characteristics will change for this essay, but they will work as a class to determine these new specific characteristics. Point out the following characteristics on the checklist:

- “W.7.1a: I have an introduction that gives readers the context they need to understand the topic or text.”

- “W.7.1a: I state my claim clearly, and my writing stays focused.”

- “W.7.1a: I fairly acknowledge claims that are different from my own.”

- Ask:

“Are there any specific criteria you should be aware of and list in that column on the checklist?” (Responses will vary. Possible responses: I describe plastic pollution. I tell which point in the cycle is the best place to address it. I state my claim and points.)

“What background information does the reader need to be able to understand your essay? (The problems with plastic pollution and the points in the life cycle.)

“What are some ideas you have for providing context for this essay?” (I will introduce the problem with a description of plastic pollution that shows how bad the problem is. I will acknowledge the other points in the life cycle.)

- As students share out, capture their responses in the Characteristics of My Argument Essay column as needed.

- Ask students to retrieve their copies of the **texts from Module 4, Units 1 and 2**: *A Plastic Ocean*, *Trash Vortex*, “Five Weird Materials That Could Replace Plastic,” “Five Things You Can Do to End Plastic Pollution,” and “Boyan Slat: The Great Pacific Garbage Patch Kid.”

- Distribute **lined paper**, and invite students to work in their predetermined essay pairs, using the Model Argument Essay, the Criteria of an Effective Argument Essay anchor chart, and the Argument Writing Checklist to write an introduction. Remind students to refer to the **domain-specific** and academic **word walls** and **online or print dictionaries** as needed, especially for the definitions they provide while giving context in the introduction.

- Circulate to support students as they write. Provide students an opportunity to verbally recount the main claim from their Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer and rehearse their sentences with their partner before writing. This may allow them additional time to organize their thinking. Remind students to write in complete sentences and to leave a blank line between each line of their writing. ▲

- Invite students to record Y for yes and the date in the final column of their Argument Writing checklist if they feel the criteria marked on their checklists have been achieved in their writing in this lesson.

- Before students leave class, ensure they understand the homework assignment, especially the grammar review and examples at the top of the homework. Also, as necessary, allow students several minutes to begin the homework so they can access additional support as necessary. Inform students that they will review their responses with a partner at the beginning of the following lesson.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target and the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- Challenge students to rephrase the W.7.1a criteria on the **Argument Writing checklist** into simpler language that their peers who need heavier support can understand. Rephrasing the criteria ensures that students comprehend the writing expectations.

- Also, ask students to underline the language structures in the introduction of the **Model Argument Essay** that can be used in their pair essay. For example, “People have suggested,” “These efforts are helpful, but the most effective place to reduce plastic pollution is,” and “By \_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_, we can help ensure a future that is free of plastic pollution.” Students can share these examples with their classmates who need heavier support. Then they can modify them for their own pair essay.

For Heavier Support

- If students are literate in their home language, they can translate the W.7.1a criteria on the **Argument Writing checklist** that their peers who need lighter support rephrased. Translating or rephrasing the criteria ensures that students comprehend the writing expectations.

- Encourage students to use the language structures from the model essay to craft their own introduction. Students can use the sentences as frames, replacing the life cycle stage and points with those that fit their pair essay. Using the model will give students confidence and success with a complex writing task.

Homework

A. Modifying Phrases

- Students create sentences from phrases without misplaced or dangling modifiers to complete **Homework: Modifying Phrases: Lesson 8**.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
