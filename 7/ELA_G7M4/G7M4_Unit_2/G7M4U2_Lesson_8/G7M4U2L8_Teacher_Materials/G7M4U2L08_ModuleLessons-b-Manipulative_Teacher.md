<td>It’s easy to forget about plastic<br />
once you’re done using it, but the problem<br />
doesn’t go away. A plastic bottle<br />
could be around for five hundred years<br />
before it starts to decay (Hullinger).<br />
One whale could swallow as many as 80<br />
plastic bags (Acharya). We must take<br />

effective place to reduce plastic<br />
pollution is at the beginning of its<br />

is free of plastic pollution.</td>
