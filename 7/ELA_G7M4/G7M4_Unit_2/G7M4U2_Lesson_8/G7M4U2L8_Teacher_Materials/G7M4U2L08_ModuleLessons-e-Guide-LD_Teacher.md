Launch

Display the Language Dive sentence from the Literary Argument Essay in Module 3, Unit 2, Lesson 9 (**Of the works we’ve studied so far, however, the painting *African Phantasy: Awakening* and the poems “The Negro Speaks of Rivers” and “Lift Every Voice and Sing” most clearly demonstrate the theme of finding strength and hope by looking back to the past**) and tell students that this Language Dive also focuses on the main claim of a Model Argument Essay. Invite students to consider how the main claims in these dives are similar and different. Additionally, note that this sentence includes a modifying phrase, which students have been learning about throughout this unit in their homework and entrance tickets.

we can help ensure a future

Deconstruct

- **we**

“Who is this chunk about?” (The word we refers to people in general, to all humans on earth.)

- **ensure**

“What do you think the word ensure means? Is there a familiar word or affix in this word that helps you understand its meaning?” (Sure is a familiar word that means certain and to not have any doubts. One meaning of the prefix en- is to be in the state of something. Ensure means to make sure, or to make certain, of something.)

- **a future**

“What can we help ensure?” (We can help ensure a future of something; what will happen to someone or something in the time after the present.)

- Explain that students will find out in the subsequent chunk more about the kind of future we can help ensure.

- Students can discuss in pairs what they think the subsequent chunk will tell us about the future we can help ensure. Encourage students to refer to the previous sentence in the Model Argument Essay for help. (**These efforts are helpful, but the most effective place to reduce plastic pollution is at the beginning of its life cycle.**) (Answers will vary, but may include: we can help ensure a future where plastic pollution is reduced.)

that is free of plastic pollution.

Deconstruct

- **that**

“Can you figure out why the author started this chunk with the word that?” (That connects the upcoming chunk to the previous chunk and provides us with more information. What follows the word that will tell us what kind of future we can help ensure.)

- **free of plastic pollution:** “What kind of a future can we help ensure?” (a future **free of plastic pollution**)

- **free of**

“What does it mean to be free of something?” (Free of means to not contain something; to not have something in existence.)

- Students can discuss in pairs what we can do to help ensure a future that is free of plastic pollution. Remind students that this model essay is focused on things we can do to reduce plastic at the beginning of the plastic life cycle. (Answers will vary, but may include: not producing as much plastic, or preventing people from using plastic in the first place.) If time allows, invite students to sketch what they discussed on their note-catchers. 

- Place this chunk and the previous chunk side by side.

“What do you notice about these two chunks together?” (Answers will vary, but may include: these chunks together create a complete sentence; these chunks together build on the main claim started in the previous sentence.)

“These two chunks together form a complete sentence. However, there are additional chunks in our Language Dive. What kind of information might additional chunks add?” (Answers will vary, but may include: additional chunks might give an explanation, provide additional context, or elaborate on what we can do to help ensure a future free of plastic pollution.)

By inventing and using new materials

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- **By**

“Can you figure out why the author wrote the word by?” (By is a preposition  
that tells us the method or means used to do something. It tells us we will find out ways that we can help ensure a future that is free of plastic pollution.)

- **inventing and using new materials**

“What are ways we can help ensure a future that is free of plastic pollution?”  
(by inventing and using new materials)

- Invite students to notice that this chunk is highlighted in yellow on the Model Argument Essay Introduction Strips as it is Point 1 of the essay. Remind students that this point, Point 1, will be the focus of the second paragraph of this essay.

- Students can discuss in pairs what new materials people might invent and use to help ensure a future free of plastic pollution. Encourage them to refer to the second paragraph of this essay to support their discussion. (Answers will vary, but may include: water bottles made of material you can eat and bags made of shrimp shells.) Then, they can list new materials they discussed on their note-catchers. 

- **Students can use Conversation Cues as they discuss. To provide heavier support, display a suggested sequence, such as the one below:**

- Let’s take time to think and write or sketch. (Goal 1)

- Who can repeat what your classmate said? (Goal 2)

- Who can add on to what your classmate said? I’ll give you time to think. (Goal 4)

- How is what \_\_\_\_\_said the same as/different from what \_\_\_\_\_ said? (Goal 4)

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Students can complete the following sentence frames to include the ways they embody a habit of character, adding a modifying phrase starting with the preposition by to both the end and the beginning of the sentence.

> **I can demonstrate \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ by \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

habit of character verb phrase showing how the habit of character is demonstrated

> (e.g., I can demonstrate <u>responsibility</u> by <u>taking steps to reduce the use of plastic pollution in my own life</u>.) 
>
> **By \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, I demonstrate \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**
>
> verb phrase showing how the habit of character is demonstrated habit of character
>
> (e.g., By <u>taking steps to reduce the use of plastic pollution in my own life</u>, I can demonstrate <u>responsibility</u>.) 

- To provide lighter support: Invite students to use coordinate adjectives as they complete the frame. (e.g., I can demonstrate <u>responsibility</u> by <u>taking steps to reduce the use of unnecessary, wasteful plastic pollution in my own life</u>.)

- To provide heavier support: Provide a language bank with varying habits of character for students to choose from (e.g., hard work, perseverance, initiative, responsibility, determination).

and banning plastic as much as possible,

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- **and**

“What does the word and tell us in this chunk?” (And is a conjunction that signals that additional related information is coming, which connects to the previous chunk.)

“How does the information in this chunk connect to the previous chunk?” (This chunk tells us another way we can help ensure a future that is free of plastic pollution.)

- **banning plastic**

“What is another way we can help ensure a future that is free of plastic pollution?” (By banning plastic. To ban something means to officially say something cannot be done, to prevent the use of something.)

- Invite students to notice that this chunk is highlighted in blue on the Organize the Model: Introduction strips, as it is Point 2 of the essay. Remind students that this point, Point 2, will be the focus of the third paragraph of this essay.

- Direct students to discuss in pairs what people can do to ban the use of plastic to help ensure a future free of plastic pollution. Encourage them to refer to the third paragraph of this essay to support their discussion. (Answers will vary, but may include countries banning the use of plastic bags, as was done in Rwanda, as well as other countries around the world.)

- Then, they can list the ideas they discussed on their note-catchers, underneath the ideas from the previous chunk. 

- **as much as possible**

“Can you figure out why the author included the phrase as much as possible?” (As much as possible tells us that we won’t be able to ban plastic altogether. However, we should try our best to ban plastic whenever and however we can.)

- Place this chunk and the previous chunk side by side.

“What do you notice about these two chunks together?” (Answers will vary, but may include: these chunks together create a modifying phrase, which modifies the independent clause in this sentence. Together they form Points 1 and 2 of the Model Argument Essay, telling us two ways we can help ensure a future that is free of plastic pollution.)

By inventing and using new materials  
and banning plastic as much as possible, we can help ensure a future that is free  
of plastic pollution.

Reconstruct

- **<u>By inventing and using new materials and banning plastic as much as possible,</u> we can help ensure a future that is free of plastic pollution.**

“Can you say this sentence in a different order? How? What would we have to remove or change?” (Yes; you could rearrange the chunks to be We can help ensure a future that is free of plastic pollution by inventing and using new materials and banning plastic as much as possible. We would no longer need the comma if we said the sentence in this order.)

- Invite four students to each hold a chunk and switch places to show the sentence in a different, correct order: **We can help ensure a future that is free of plastic pollution by inventing and using new materials and banning plastic as much  
  as possible.**

“Can you figure out why the author placed the modifying phrase, By inventing and using new materials and banning plastic as much as possible at the beginning of the sentence rather than at the end?” (The author placed this modifying phrase at the beginning of the sentence for emphasis.)

- Remind students that, in English, whatever comes earlier in a sentence typically has greater focus, as noted in previous Language Dives (Module 2, Unit 2, Lessons 6–7 and Module 2, Unit 2, Lesson 9). The author wanted to emphasize the ways we can ensure a future that is free of plastic pollution, that will be Points 1 and 2 of this essay.

“What is the relationship between our Language Dive sentence and the sentence that comes before it?” (This Language Dive sentence and the sentence before it together state the main claim.)

- Invite students to read this sentence and the one before it together: **These efforts are helpful, but the most effective place to reduce plastic pollution is at the beginning of its life cycle. By inventing and using new materials and banning plastic as much as possible, we can help ensure a future that is free of plastic pollution.**

“How is the introduction in the model similar to and different from the introduction to the last essay you wrote?” (Both provide context that helps the reader understand the topic. The points we will discuss are still there, but in this model, the opinion is stated in one sentence, and the two points the author will use to support the opinion are supported in the next sentence. Also, in our literary argument essays, we used three points, but this essay has two points.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Answers will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question:  
What can be done about plastic pollution? What is being done? What can I do?” (Answers will vary.)

Practice (Sentence)

- Students can use the following frame to write a main claim for their argument essay, that matches their essay objective: **I can write an introduction for my essay giving context on plastic pollution, acknowledging an opposing claim and clearly stating the main claim of the piece.**

> **The most effective place to reduce plastic pollution is at the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of its**
>
> phase
>
> **life cycle. By \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_,**
>
> verb phrase listing two ways to reduce plastic pollution at a certain point of the plastic life cycle
>
> **we can help ensure a future that is free of plastic pollution.** 
>
> (e.g., The most effective place to reduce plastic pollution is at the <u>middle</u> of its life cycle. By <u>limiting the single-use plastic we consume</u>, we can help ensure a future that is free of plastic pollution.)

- To provide lighter support: “Can you say/write the second sentence in a different order?”

- To provide heavier support: Invite students to discuss the meaning of the sentence in home language groups.
