(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, respond in writing to the following prompts.

Which picture or graphic from Chapter 2 do you find most intriguing or helpful for understanding the text and why? What do you think the author’s purpose was in selecting this picture or graphic?

I think the drawing on page 17 is the most interesting because it helps to show the history of making materials like rubber and plastic. I think the author included it to show how long we have been making certain kinds of materials, and also how much things have changed.

On the lines below, list several vocabulary words you identified in Chapter 2 and their meanings.

Answers will vary, but may include:

synthetic (20): made with chemicals formed in a laboratory instead of something found in nature; human-made; artificial

inert (25): not being able to act or move

benign (25): not harmful
