Chapter 2 of *Trash Vortex* describes the history of plastic. The author tells the story of different materials throughout history and how plastic was discovered and perfected. With these examples, the author develops the central idea that humans have always looked to perfect new materials to make their lives easier. The author also develops a central idea that people did not understand the damage that plastic could do when it was first introduced. The author uses examples from magazines at the time and descriptions of plastic’s history. These examples show that people were quick to throw away plastic without thinking about the pollution it would cause. Finally, at the end of the chapter, the author develops the idea that plastic has become a big problem. She uses a quote from Charles Moore to emphasize this point. Throughout chapter 2, the author tells the history of plastic and how it has become a big problem today.
