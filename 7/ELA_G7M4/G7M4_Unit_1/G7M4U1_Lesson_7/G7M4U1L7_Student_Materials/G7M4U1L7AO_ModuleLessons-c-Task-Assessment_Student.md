Through the Plastic Bank, we make plastic waste a currency, so that people in developing countries can earn an income while preventing plastic from entering the ocean.

CRAIG: David Katz and Shaun Frankson founded the Plastic Bank. They established a social plastic recycling system in Haiti that exchanges plastic for solar cell phone charging, sustainable cookstoves, and cash. It’s like a fair trade plastic, where it’s ethically sourced, and it’s above market rate income that they earn. The people in need can go and collect the plastic and create a microeconomy around recycling. (1:28:20–1:28:55)
