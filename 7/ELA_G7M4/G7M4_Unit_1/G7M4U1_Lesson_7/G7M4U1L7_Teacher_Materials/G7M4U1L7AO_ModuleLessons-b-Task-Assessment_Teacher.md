Mid-Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Techniques and Argument in a Video

(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Part I**

**Directions:** Your teacher will play a clip (minutes 1:26:46–1:27:30) of the documentary *A Plastic Ocean* three times.

**First viewing: Watch and think.**

- What are two or more central ideas in the video?

- How do you know? What are the supporting details?

Take notes on this page as you watch, if you would like. (SL.7.2)

Student responses will vary, but may include: Morton says plastic should be reused because it costs \$150/ton in landfill but pays \$1000+ when recycled.

**Second viewing: Answer the following questions.**

1.  This question has two parts. First answer Part A, then answer Part B.

**Part A**

What claim is Roger Morton making in this section? (SL.7.3)

2.  that plastic is too expensive

3.  <u>that plastic should be reused</u>

4.  that landfills are misunderstood

5.  that landfills should be eliminated

**Part B**

How does he support this claim? (SL.7.3)

1.  <u>by providing the costs of plastic</u>

<!-- -->

6.  by explaining how landfills work

7.  by demonstrating the recycling process

8.  by sharing personal stories about landfills

9.  Roger Morton is listed as working for Axion Polymers, which is a company that sells recycled products. How does this affect how you evaluate his claims? (SL.7.3)

Responses will vary. Possible response: It does make me realize that he has an interest in saying that plastic should be recycled. But the prices he gives for the plastic being reused versus thrown away are still convincing.

**Third viewing: Check your answers. Revise as necessary.**

Part II

**Directions:** Your teacher will play a second clip (minutes 1:27:30–1:29:41) of the documentary *A Plastic Ocean* three times.

**First viewing: Watch and think.**

- What are the main ideas?

- How do you know? What are the supporting details?

Take notes on this page as you watch, if you would like. (SL.7.2)

Student responses will vary, but may include: Plastic Bank sets up systems in places like Haiti where people can collect plastic and get money. Then plastic gets recycled and made into new plastic, which Frankson calls “social plastic” because it helps others and the environment.

**Second viewing: Answer the following questions.**

10. Reread this part of the transcript, and answer the question below:

“Once sorted, recycled plastics are brought into factories like this, where they can become part of a circular economy, cleaned of labels and processed into newborn nurdles, ready to be sold once again.” (1:27:24–1:27:37)

How do the techniques in the video help to make the claims in the transcripts clearer? (RI.7.7)

11. by using emotional music

12. by using an expert interview

13. by using graphics to explain the ideas

14. <u>by showing images of what is being discussed</u>

15. Read this excerpt of the transcript, and answer the question below:

Through the Plastic Bank, we make plastic waste a currency, so that people in developing countries can earn an income while preventing plastic from entering the ocean.

CRAIG: David Katz and Shaun Frankson founded the Plastic Bank. They established a social plastic recycling system in Haiti that exchanges plastic for solar cell phone charging, sustainable cookstoves, and cash. It’s like a fair trade plastic, where it’s ethically sourced, and it’s above market rate income that they earn. The people in need can go and collect the plastic and create a microeconomy around recycling. (1:28:20–1:28:55)

How does the video help describe the work of the plastic bank? (RI.7.7)

16. by using music to create a dark tone

17. by describing materials other than plastic

18. by using graphics to show how much plastic is worth

19. <u>by showing people can buy goods with plastic they gather</u>

20. This question has two parts. First answer Part A, then answer Part B.

**Part A**

What is Shaun Frankson’s claim in this excerpt? (SL.7.3)

21. Plastic of all kinds hurts the planet.

22. Most people want to help the planet.

23. <u>Social plastic is better for the environment than virgin plastic.</u>

24. It is difficult to choose between social plastic and virgin plastic.

**Part B**

How does the video clip support this claim? (SL.7.3)

1.  <u>by explaining how social plastic is created</u>

<!-- -->

25. by using graphics to show how much plastic is worth

26. by providing interviews with people who use virgin plastic

27. by showing the negative impacts of virgin plastic on people

28. Shaun Frankson is described as a founder of “Plastic Bank,” which runs the programs he describes in the video. How does this affect how you evaluate his claims? (SL.7.3)

Responses will vary. Possible response: The fact that he is a founder of the “Plastic Bank,” does show that he may be biased towards it. However, the benefit of social plastic seems clear enough to support the idea that it is better for the planet.

Part III

29. Evaluate the overall argument in this part of the film. What is the claim? Is the evidence sufficient and relevant to support the claim? Is the reasoning sound? How does the speaker’s viewpoint influence the strength of the argument? (SL.7.3)

The claim is that plastic should be recycled. The evidence is relevant because it relates to the claim. The evidence is sufficient because there are multiple figures, images, and examples to support the claim. The reasoning is sound because the speaker explains the connection between recycling and positive effects. The speaker may be biased because he owns a plastic recycling company. However, the argument is still strong because the evidence and reasoning show that plastic recycling is a powerful solution.

**Third viewing: Check your answers. Revise as necessary.**
