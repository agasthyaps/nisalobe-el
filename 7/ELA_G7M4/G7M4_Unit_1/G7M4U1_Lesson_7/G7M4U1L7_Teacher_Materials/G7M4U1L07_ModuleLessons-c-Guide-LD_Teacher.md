Launch

Prior to the Language Dive, review the work with simple, compound, and complex sentences from Module 3. Invite students to recall the characteristics of each type of sentence, and to use this information to determine which type of a sentence this is.

Through the Plastic Bank,

Deconstruct

- **the Plastic Bank**

“What is this chunk about?” (The Plastic Bank, a company dedicated to reducing the plastic waste that enters the ocean. \[noun phrase\])

- **Through**

“What does the word through tell us in this chunk?” (Through means by means of or with the agency of, telling us that the Plastic Bank makes something happen. We will find out what happens through the Plastic Bank in the subsequent chunk. \[preposition\])

- Students discuss in pairs what they think happens through the Plastic Bank, reflecting on the transcript and video clip from the mid-unit assessment to support their discussion.

we make plastic waste a currency,

Deconstruct

- **we**

“Who is this chunk about?” (We refers to the Plastic Bank as a company, and the people who work there. \[pronoun\])

“What does the Plastic Bank do?” (They make plastic waste a currency, meaning they accept plastic waste as a type of money that can be exchanged for services, cash, or other items. \[verb phrase\])

- Students can recall from the transcript and video clip some of the exchanges that were made for plastic waste in Haiti. (Answers will vary, but may include solar cell phone charging, sustainable cook stoves, and cash.)

“Does this chunk form a complete sentence? How do you know?” (Yes; it contains a subject \[we\] and a verb phrase \[make plastic waste a currency\] and it tells a complete thought.)

“If this chunk is a complete sentence, why are there additional chunks in our Language Dive? What kind of information might the additional chunks add?” (Answers will vary, but may include: the additional chunks might give an explanation and provide additional context, just as the previous chunk provided information about who makes plastic waste a currency.)

so that people in developing countries can earn an income,

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Ask:

“What additional information does this chunk provide? What words help us figure this out?” (This chunk tells us the reason the Plastic Bank makes plastic waste a currency. The words so that show purpose and signal that what follows will be a reason for information mentioned previously. Note that so is often followed by that when used to show purpose, but that can be removed without changing the meaning. \[so that = conjunction; collocation\])

“What is the reason the Plastic Bank makes plastic waste a currency?” (So that people in developing countries can earn an income.)

- **developing countries**

“What are developing countries? Is there a familiar word or affix in the word developing that helps us understand what it means?” (Develop means to grow into something bigger, stronger, and more advanced. A developing country is a country with an economy that is not yet as developed, or advanced, as other countries, but that is growing. \[noun phrase\])

- Students can discuss in pairs some ways they think people in developing countries earn an income from plastic waste. (Answers will vary, but may include that people earn an income by picking up plastic waste from beaches and bringing it to the Plastic Bank in exchange for services, cash, or other items.) Then, students can switch pairs and discuss why they think the Plastic Bank focuses specifically on supporting people in developing countries to earn an income. (Answers will vary, but may include that the Plastic Bank has a social impact by supporting people who may not otherwise have many other opportunities to earn an income.)

- It is important to note that, while the economy in developing countries may not be as advanced as other countries, developing countries are advanced in other ways and have many assets, such as people having a strong sense of compassion for one another, and working in collaboration to make the world a better place. Invite students to share other ways developing countries may be advanced and some of the assets they might have.

- **Students can use Conversation Cues as they discuss. To provide heavier support, display a suggested sequence, such as the one below:**

- Let’s take time to think and write or sketch. (Goal 1)

- Can you say more about that? (Goal 1)

- Do you agree or disagree with what your classmate said? Why? (Goal 4)

- Who can add on to what your classmate said? I’ll give you time to think. (Goal 4)

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Students can complete the following sentence frame, using the conjunction **so that** to provide an explanation for why they do something.

**I \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ so that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

verb phrase noun phrase + verb phrase

while preventing plastic from entering the ocean.

Deconstruct

- **while**

“Can you figure out why the author started this chunk with the word while?” (While is used to signal that the information in this chunk is happening at the same time as the information in the previous chunk \[people in developing countries can earn an income\], and is also part of the reason the Plastic Bank makes plastic waste a currency. \[conjunction\])

“What are the people in developing countries doing at the same time they earn an income?” (They are preventing plastic from entering the ocean.)

“Can you say more about that?” (Answers will vary.)

- Students can discuss in pairs how making plastic waste a currency helps prevent plastic from entering the ocean, at the same time it helps people earn an income. Invite them to reflect on the images in the video clip to help them do so. (Answers will vary, but may include: Making plastic waste a currency encourages people to pick up the plastic that would otherwise enter the ocean and allows them to earn an income by exchanging the plastic waste for other goods.)

Through the Plastic Bank, we make plastic waste a currency, so that people in developing countries can earn an income, while preventing plastic from entering the ocean.

Reconstruct

- **Through the Plastic Bank, we make plastic waste a currency, <u>so that people in developing countries can earn an income,</u> while preventing plastic from entering the ocean.**

“Is this sentence a simple, compound, complex, or compound-complex; how do you know? How does this sentence signal differing relationships among ideas?” (This sentence is a complex sentence because it has one independent clause \[we make plastic waste a currency\] and three dependent clauses \[Through the Plastic Bank; so that people in developing countries can earn an income; while preventing plastic from entering the ocean.\] The dependent clauses add important information about who makes plastic waste a currency \[the Plastic Bank\], and the reasons plastic currency is made \[so that people in developing countries can make an income; to prevent plastic from entering the ocean\].)

“Can we say this sentence in a different order? What would we have to remove or change?” (Answers will vary, but may include: We make plastic waste a currency through the Plastic Bank, so that people in developing countries can earn an income, while preventing plastic from entering the ocean. They may also rearrange the last two dependent clauses, making slight changes such as: We make plastic waste a currency through the Plastic Bank, so that people in developing countries prevent plastic waste from entering the ocean, while earning an income.)

“How does this sentence help us understand the speaker’s reasoning for the claim that plastic should be recycled?” (The speaker uses sound reasoning for the claim by explaining the connection between recycling and positive effects, such as the social impact of supporting people with earning an income, and the environmental impact of minimizing the plastic waste entering the ocean.)

- Replay the video clip at 1:28:26–1:28:36, where this sentence is stated, and invite students to compare the sentence in the transcript to the way it is portrayed in the video. (Answers will vary, but may include that the images in the video help emphasize the social and environmental impact of the Plastic Bank, with images of people smiling as they earn an income and picking up plastic waste along the ocean shore. The music also helps make the video clip more interesting.)

- If time allows, invite volunteers to act out picking up plastic waste along the ocean shore and exchanging it for other goods, demonstrating how this prevents plastic from entering the ocean. Encourage students to get creative as they act this out! (For example, one student might act as the ocean, smiling and giving a sigh of relief as the plastic waste is picked up, rather than entering its waters.) Students can sketch what they acted out on their note-catcher. 

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Answers will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question:  
What can be done about plastic pollution? What is being done? What can I do?” (Answers will vary.)

Practice (Sentence)

- Students can complete the following sentence frames by stating a claim about the importance of reducing plastic waste, with reasons to support their claim. 

> **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ so that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

claim about reducing plastic waste reason to support claim

> **while \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

reason to support claim
