Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- SL.7.3 – Work Time B: In a Language Dive, students explore a sentence from *A Plastic Ocean* in order to analyze a speaker’s argument for relevance and sufficiency of evidence and soundness of reasoning.

- For the mid-unit assessment in Work Time A of this lesson, students watch a clip of *A Plastic Ocean* and read a transcript of that clip. Then, they identify the central ideas and supporting details of the film clip (SL.7.2). Students then compare and contrast the clip to the transcript, analyzing each medium’s portrayal of the subject (RI.7.7). Next, students delineate a speaker’s argument and specific claims, evaluating the soundness of the reasoning and the relevance and sufficiency of the evidence (SL.7.3).

- In this lesson, the habit of character focus is on working to become effective learners and ethical people. Students practice integrity and perseverance as they work independently on the assessment.

- The Think-Pair-Share protocol is used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- In the clip of *A Plastic Ocean* viewed in this lesson, all the speakers contribute to a better world by helping the environment. Roger Morton demonstrates it through his efforts with recycling. David Katz and Shaun Kurtz demonstrate it through their work with The Plastic Bank and social plastic. Cynar demonstrates it by turning end-of-life plastic into diesel fuel.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- If students finish the assessment early, allow them to watch one or more of the following portions of the film: 19:02–20:00, 14:35–15:57, 37:10–40:32, 1:05:28–1:06:47, 1:09:42–1:11:40, 1:20:53–1:22:22, 1:23:53–1:25:21, 1:35:10–1:35:45. Ask students to note which portions are informational and which portions are argumentative. Invite students, when they find argument sections, to share with the class the speaker’s argument and specific claims, evaluating the soundness of the reasoning and the relevance and sufficiency of the evidence. They may create a poster, film clip, or a slide presentation to share the arguments presented in the film.

- Invite students to research Axion Polymers and The Plastic Bank and present their research findings to the class on a poster, film clip, a slide presentation, or some other method of their choosing.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the first half of this unit, students watched various clips of *A Plastic Ocean*, comparing the clip to the transcript and analyzing the speakers’ arguments, and evaluating their evidence and reasoning. This lesson continues this analysis in an assessment.

Support All Students

- At this point, students should be reading the transcript independently. However, if some or all students need more support, read the sentences aloud. ▲

- The subject matter in this film includes descriptions of the environmental impact of plastic pollution, such as harm to animals and humans. Continue to monitor students to determine if issues surface as a result of the content of this chapter that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually. To support students in processing this content, ask: “What habit of character did you use as you watched and discussed this film?” Students may need to draw on perseverance, empathy, and compassion as they read and discuss this content, being sensitive to their own and others’ reactions to the information presented.

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment. ▲

- For some students, this assessment may require more than the 30 minutes allotted. Provide time over multiple days if necessary. ▲

- Some students may still require the following supports for the assessment, but most students should be able to complete the assessment without them. If possible, situate students so that those who need these supports can access them: academic word wall and domain-specific word wall, Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart, Strategies to Answer Selected Response Questions anchor chart, and print or online dictionaries. ▲

- To support ELLs, the assessment in this lesson consists of tasks and questions in the same format as the activities students have completed throughout the unit thus far. This gradual release supports students in independent achievement on this assessment.

- ELLs may find it challenging to independently write a constructed response evaluating the argument even with all the practice on similar tasks throughout the unit. Remind students that they have successfully completed similar activities in class, and encourage them to do their best. Also, encourage them to try to recall sentence frames they have been given throughout the unit for similar responses.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, 7.I.B.6, 7.I.C.10, 7.I.C.11, and 7.I.C.12.

Assessment Guidance

- All assessment materials (the student prompt, answer key, and sample student responses) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback on this assessment, use the answer key and sample student responses.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will read *Trash Vortex* for central ideas and author’s purpose.

- Students’ Mid-Unit 1 Assessments will be returned in Lessons 12–13 with feedback.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Return students’ **Module 3 End of Unit 3 Assessments with feedback**, and allow students time to review feedback and write their name on the board if they require support.

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 7**. Students may or may not choose to share their goals for this assessment with a partner.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Mid-Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Techniques and Argument in a Video (30 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can compare the way a transcript of *A Plastic Ocean* portrays a subject to the way it is portrayed in the video.”

“I can delineate a speaker’s argument and claims in *A Plastic Ocean*.”

“I can evaluate a speaker’s evidence and reasoning in *A Plastic Ocean*.”

- Distribute **Mid-Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Techniques and Argument in a Video**. Tell students that for this assessment, they will watch a clip of ***A Plastic Ocean*** several times, and they will compare and contrast the clip to the transcript in selected response questions. They will also identify the central ideas and supporting details of the film clip. Then they will delineate the speaker’s argument and specific claims, evaluating the soundness of the reasoning and the relevance and sufficiency of the evidence in constructed and selected response questions.

- Read aloud the directions for each part of the assessment as students follow along. Answer clarifying questions.

- Before students begin the assessment, ask them to Think-Pair-Share:

“What value does the task of analyzing a video have for you beyond this class? Why?” (Answers will vary, but may include: this task has a lot of value for me because I will have to analyze videos in most of my high school and college classes and in some careers.)

“What will help you succeed on this assessment?” (Answers will vary but may include: using my strategies to answer selected response questions and writing a constructed response question by recalling my knowledge of how perspective will influence a claim.)

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence. Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart** and review perseverance, taking initiative, and taking responsibility. Remind students that because they will be reading and answering questions independently for the assessment, they will need to practice these habits.

- Invite students to begin the assessment. Circulate to monitor and document their test-taking skills.

- When the class finishes, incorporate reflection on and awareness of the following academic mindsets: “I can succeed at this” and “My ability and competence grow with my effort.”

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What helped you to be successful at that task? How much effort did you put in on this task? How did your effort affect your learning?” (Answers will vary, but may include: I was successful at that task because I focused and worked hard. I also understood what I was doing and what was being asked of me, which helped me succeed as well.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- Before the mid-unit assessment in Work Time A, challenge students to underline key vocabulary in the assessment directions and writing prompt as the class reads them aloud. Also, invite students who need lighter support to restate or clarify information for students who need heavier support. These supports ensure that students understand each task included in the assessment.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time A, read the directions for the assessment slowly, twice, and also post them. This ensures that ELLs who may not be able to easily follow the language of the directions have multiple opportunities to access them.

- Display a “map” of the assessment to reference while explaining directions to the mid-unit assessment. This will reduce ambiguity and give students a clearer picture of what they can expect so that they can better allocate their time and attention. Provide students with colored pencils or highlighters so that they can mark up the “map” as needed. Example:

**Part I**

- Watch the film clip and take notes on the central ideas and supporting details.

- Watch the film clip again.

- Read each question and each possible answer.

- Cross out incorrect answers.

- Select the best answer to the question.

- Repeat steps 3–5 for each question in Part I.

- Watch the film clip again to check answers.

**Part II**

- Complete steps 1–7 for items 3–6.

**Part III**

- Write a paragraph with

1.  a topic sentence that states the claim;

2.  sentences that evaluate the evidence;

3.  sentences that evaluate the reasoning;

4.  sentences that evaluate the speaker’s bias; and

5.  a concluding sentence that evaluates the overall strength of the argument.

- To help students manage their time during the mid-unit assessment, display on the board or on a poster suggested times when students move on to the next question. Allocate the most time to Part III item 7, the constructed response.

Closing and Assessment

A. Language Dive: *A Plastic Ocean* (1:28:26–1:28:36) – SL.7.3 (10 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to facilitate a Language Dive with the following sentence from the film:

“Through The Plastic Bank, we make plastic waste a currency, so that people in developing countries can earn an income, while preventing plastic from entering the ocean.”

- Use the accompanying materials to facilitate the Language Dive:

- **Language Dive Guide: *A Plastic Ocean***, **(1:28:26–1:28:36) (for teacher reference)**

- **Language Dive: *A Plastic Ocean***, **(1:28:26–1:28:36) Sentence Chunk Chart (for teacher reference)**

- **Language Dive: *A Plastic Ocean*** **(1:28:26–1:28:36) note-catcher**

- **Language Dive: *A Plastic Ocean*** **(1:28:26–1:28:36) sentence chunk strips**

- **Language Dive: *A Plastic Ocean*** **(1:28:26–1:28:36) note-catcher (example for teacher reference).**

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- During the Language Dive of Closing and Assessment A, students analyze a sentence from the film *A Plastic Ocean* to analyze the speaker’s argument and different types of sentences. Invite ELLs to remind their classmates who need heavier support about the four different types of sentences and their definitions (simple sentence, complex sentence, compound sentence, compound-complex sentence). Encourage students to give examples of each type of sentence from their note-catchers. They can share these examples with classmates who need heavier support. Additional practice in identifying, interpreting, and explaining different sentence types will improve students’ language acquisition, speaking, and listening skills.

- At the end of the lesson, encourage students to take a few moments to reflect on their learning. Use the following questions to prompt reflection:

- What have you learned about plastic pollution? about documentary film techniques? About how to identify and evaluate a speaker’s argument?

- What new vocabulary or language structures did you learn in this unit?

- Encourage students to share the most important or exciting thing they learned in this unit. Reflecting on learning allows students to more firmly grasp abstract concepts and gives them confidence and ownership over their own learning.

For Heavier Support

- During the Language Dive of Closing and Assessment A, some students may need additional support as they complete the sentence frame in the Practice section (I \_\_\_\_\_ so that \_\_\_\_\_). Ask students to work together to generate a list of verb and noun phrases (*study*, *try hard*, *work with classmates/to succeed in school*, *to do well in school*, *to help others*, etc.) As necessary, model using a student-generated idea to complete the sentence frame: “I study so that I do well in school.”

- As in the lighter support, at the end of the lesson, encourage students to take a few moments to reflect on their learning. Use the following questions to prompt students who need more support in their reflection:

- What have you learned about plastic pollution? What film techniques did you learn about? What did you learn about speakers’ arguments?

- What new vocabulary or language structures did you learn in this unit?

- Encourage students to share the most important or exciting thing they learned in this unit. Reflecting on learning allows students to more firmly grasp abstract concepts and gives them confidence and ownership over their own learning.

Homework

A. Reflect on Film

- To complete **Homework: Reflect on Film: Lesson 7**, Students write in response to the following questions: How do you feel about what you are learning in the film *A Plastic Ocean*? What action might you like to take in response to the film?

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
