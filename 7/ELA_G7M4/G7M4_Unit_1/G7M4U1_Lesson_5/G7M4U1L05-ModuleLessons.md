Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.7.7 – Work Time A: Students watch a clip of *A Plastic Ocean* to determine the main ideas and compare a portion of the transcript to an excerpt from the video.

- SL.7.3 – Work Time B: Students rewatch the clip of *A Plastic Ocean* and analyze a claim made in the video.

- SL.7.3 – Closing and Assessment A: Students answer selected response questions about the clip of *A Plastic Ocean* that they watched and analyzed in class today.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners by working independently to analyze a video and collaborating in groups to evaluate the arguments in the documentary video.

- The Dance Card and Think-Pair-Share protocols are used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- An optional Mini Language Dive, intended for use after students watch and analyze the video during Work Time A, is available in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Release more responsibility more quickly to students as they comprehend the tasks or concepts. For example:

- Students can create their own note-catchers, a skill they will need in high school, college, and even many careers. Ask students to consider the learning targets to help them design their own note-catchers.

- Students who show a greater understanding of the techniques used in the video can move on to answering the questions sooner.

- Students can write and exchange their own text-dependent questions to identify and evaluate the claims, evidence, and reasoning in other video clips such as: 14:35–15:57, 19:02–20:00, 37:10–40:32, 1:05:28–1:06:47, 1:09:42–1:11:40, 1:20:53–1:22:22, 1:23:53–1:25:21, 1:35:10–1:35:45.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students have focused on analyzing the documentary *A Plastic Ocean* for the techniques the filmmakers use to convey the ideas in the video, as well as delineating and evaluating the arguments made in the video. In this lesson, they continue the work of evaluating claims in the video.

Support All Students

- The subject matter in this film includes descriptions of the environmental impact of plastic pollution, such as harm to animals and humans. Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this chapter that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually. To support students in processing this content, ask: “What habit of character did you use as you watched and discussed this film?” Students may need to draw on perseverance, empathy, and compassion as they read and discuss this content, being sensitive to their own and others’ reactions to the information presented.

- Students may need additional support in reading and understanding the transcript and how it relates to the video. The lesson suggests several opportunities for replaying the clip to allow for comprehension. Provide more opportunities for those students struggling with analysis of the video as well as individual devices and headphones for students to watch and rewatch the clip at their own pace. ▲

- Note there is a differentiated version of the Analyze *A Plastic Ocean* (1:18:30–1:23:53) note-catcher used in Work Time B in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- If students need additional support with the note-catcher, pull small groups or individual students to coach them as needed. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson provides students the opportunity to work in groups to analyze the speaker’s argument, which is a gradual release from the whole-class analysis but still offers students peer support.

- ELLs may find it challenging to gradually release from teacher-led, whole-class work to small group analysis of the speaker’s argument in the film clip. If so, draw these students together into a small group and work with them to watch and analyze the clip then complete the note-catcher. Doing so will also allow these students to view the film clip as many times as is necessary and to work at their own pace with sufficient processing time.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, 7.I.B.6, 7.I.C.10, and 7.I.C.11.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Analyze *A Plastic Ocean* (1:18:30–1:23:53) note-catcher to ensure understanding of how the video conveys ideas as well as delineating a claim.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students prepare for their mid-unit assessment by independently analyzing a video clip from *A Plastic Ocean*.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – SL.7.2 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 5**.

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use the Dance Card protocol to have students share their responses.

- As time allows, review the homework from the previous lesson, ensuring students understand how to identify dangling modifiers.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

- To support ELLs, this lesson provides students the opportunity to work in groups to analyze the speaker’s argument, which is a gradual release from the whole-class analysis but still offers students peer support.

For Heavier Support

- To promote independence on the entrance ticket, challenge students to work independently at first to highlight key words and phrases in the transcript and grapple to answer the questions. Then they can share their highlights and responses with a partner to check and expand their work. Grappling first and then working with a partner will increase student engagement, independence, and speaking and listening skills.

Work Time

A. Analyze the Video – RI.7.7 (15 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can compare the way a transcript of *A Plastic Ocean* portrays a subject to the way it is portrayed in the video.”

- Inform students that they will be viewing another clip from ***A Plastic Ocean***. In this lesson, students will analyze the clip with the first half of their note-catchers independently, before moving into groups to analyze the claim made in the clip.

- Distribute the **Analyze *A Plastic Ocean*** **(1:18:30–1:23:53) note-catcher** and the **Analyze *A Plastic Ocean*** **(1:18:30–1:23:53) note-catche** r ▲ as necessary. The differentiated note-catcher supports students’ comprehension and writing with sentence starters. ▲ Ask students to focus on the first part of the note-catcher, explaining that the first part is the same as the one they used in the previous lesson.

- Play the clip of *A Plastic Ocean* (1:18:30–1:23:53), and ask students to individually note the gist and main ideas of the clip.

- Tell students that because this is a longer clip, for the zoom-in on the transcript section, they will only view the part of the clip that goes with the transcript (1:21:34–1:22:07). Invite students to reread this excerpt of a transcript, and play the clip for students to analyze. If necessary, play the whole clip (1:18:30–1:23:53) again for students. Display the **Techniques anchor chart** to guide students in their analysis.

- Use the Dance Card protocol to review student responses. For model responses, see the **Analyze *A Plastic Ocean*** **(1:18:30–1:23:53) note-catcher (example for teacher reference)**.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time A, after they analyze the video, invite students to participate in a Mini Language Dive in small groups to examine a sentence that offers a suggestion for decreasing plastic waste. This Mini Language Dive also gives students the opportunity to determine the grammatical function of a noun clause in the sentence (L.7.1a).

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time A, assess whether students need the support of the **Analyze A Plastic Ocean (1:18:30–1:23:53) note-catcher** ▲. This resource features sentence starters that support students with comprehension and writing. If students can forgo using this support, they will grow in independence and achievement for similar analysis tasks on assessments.

Work Time

B. Delineate and Evaluate a Speaker’s Argument – SL.7.3 (20 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can delineate a speaker’s argument and claims in *A Plastic Ocean*.”

“I can evaluate a speaker’s evidence and reasoning in *A Plastic Ocean*.”

- Focus students on the second part of the Analyze *A Plastic Ocean* (1:18:30–1:23:53) note-catcher. Note that the second part is the same as the one they used in the previous lesson. As necessary, have students Turn and Talk to remind each other of what they write in each row and how the rows and columns relate to each other.

- Remind students of their work in evaluating a claim in the documentary in the previous lesson. Invite students to form small groups to look more closely at the claim they will be focusing on for this clip: “You can’t go anywhere without seeing food wrapped in plastic. You can’t go to a restaurant without, you know, takeout boxes being in plastic, hot foods going into plastic.”

- Inform students that the speaker is also speaking in *hyperbole*, or in an exaggerated way. She doesn’t mean that you literally can’t go anywhere without seeing plastic. Rather, her claim should be evaluated as saying that it is very difficult to buy food without encountering plastic. Record *hyperbole* (an obvious and deliberate exaggeration or overstatement) on the **academic word wall** with translations in home languages, where appropriate, and invite students to record words in their **vocabulary logs**.

- Play the clip (1:18:30–1:23:53) of *A Plastic Ocean*. Invite students to discuss in small groups what evidence and reasoning the speaker and the filmmakers use to support the claim “You can’t go anywhere without seeing food wrapped in plastic. You can’t go to a restaurant without, you know, takeout boxes being in plastic, hot foods going into plastic.” For model responses, see Analyze *A Plastic Ocean* (1:18:30–1:23:53) note-catcher (example for teacher reference).

- Play the clip again and invite students to complete this section of their note-catchers, including the questions about who is making the claim and how this affects their evaluation of the claim. For model responses, see Analyze *A Plastic Ocean* (1:18:30–1:23:53) note-catcher (example for teacher reference).

- Review student responses and conduct a brief discussion about the weak evidence and reasoning in this argument. Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“Since Craig didn’t go everywhere, and only visited a small sample of restaurants, does his evidence sufficiently support Tanya’s claim? Therefore, is the reasoning sound? How might Craig and Tanya’s bias about plastic being bad affect how we evaluate their evidence? How does this weak evidence and reasoning affect the overall argument?” (The evidence is not sufficient as it just shows one person going to several places, and it is not a large enough sample to conclude that plastic is “everywhere.” The reasoning isn’t very sound because the speakers did not gather sufficient evidence. The speakers may be biased because they believe plastic is bad, and they also chose the restaurants to go to, which affects our evaluation of the claim. Therefore this argument is not very strong since the evidence is insufficient, affecting the reasoning and the overall argument.)

- Then ask them to work in pairs to synthesize their evaluation of the argument on the note-catcher. Students will determine whether the overall argument is strong by evaluating the relevance and sufficiency of evidence and the soundness of reasoning. For model responses, see Analyze *A Plastic Ocean* (1:18:30–1:23:53) note-catcher (example for teacher reference).

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- For Work Time B, ensure that students are strategically grouped to best support them. This may mean mixed groupings by language or content proficiency. However, since groups include about four students, ensure that there are two students from each level and no more than one level of difference among the students in a group. Strategic grouping affords students the opportunity of supporting and being challenged by others.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time B, assess whether students need the support of the **Analyze A Plastic Ocean (1:18:30–1:23:53) note-catcher** ▲. This resource features sentence starters that support students with comprehension and writing. If students can forgo using this support, they will grow in independence and achievement for similar analysis tasks on assessments.

- As in the lighter support, for Work Time B, ensure that students are strategically grouped to best support them. Consider language, content proficiency, and grouping students by home language.

Closing and Assessment

A. Answer Questions – RI.7.7 (5 minutes)

- Invite students to answer the questions in Part III of their note-catchers independently. Circulate and support as necessary. If students need additional time, they can answer the remaining questions for homework. Ensure students understand the task and can answer the questions by using a total participation technique to review the first few items.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Reflect on Film and Transcript

- Students write a brief paragraph reflecting on what they have seen of the documentary *A Plastic Ocean* so far, including questions they have, to complete **Homework: Reflect on Film and Transcript: Lesson 5**. Then they read excerpts of the film transcript they will study in the following lesson and reflect on the text.

B. Correctly Place Modifiers

- Students create sentences without dangling modifiers to complete **Homework: Correctly Place Modifiers**.

For Lighter Support

- Before students leave class, ask them to read the homework assignments and discuss them with a partner. Ensure students understand how to complete Homework: Correctly Place Modifiers. Remind students that they completed a similar assignment for homework in the previous lesson. As necessary, allow time for students to work in pairs to complete one or more items. Previewing the homework ensures students understand and can succeed on the task.

For Heavier Support

- Before students leave class, review the homework assignments with them. As in the lighter support, ensure students understand how to complete Homework: Correctly Place Modifiers, and remind them that they completed a similar assignment for homework in the previous lesson. Additionally, for students who need heavier support, model completing an item and allow time for students to work in pairs to complete an additional item. Previewing the homework ensures students understand and can succeed on the task.
