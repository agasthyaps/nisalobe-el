(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, read the following excerpts of the film transcript that you will study in this lesson. Then respond in writing to the prompts below.

TRANSCRIPT: “You can’t go anywhere without seeing food wrapped in plastic. You can’t go to a restaurant without, you know, takeout boxes being in plastic, hot foods going into plastic.” (1:18:30–1:18:33)

\*\*\*

Like a rubbish bin, the earth is filling up with the stuff. There is nowhere else to put it. . . . It starts with the individual, and it starts with us.

MIKE DeGRUY: What do you do? You can’t possibly filter out these tiny particles from the entire ocean. You can’t filter the entire ocean. In fact, so much plastic is in the ocean now in a form that we really can’t get to it that I feel the emphasis needs to immediately shift toward stop putting it in.

CRAIG: Mike DeGruy is right, but how do we get to the point where we can stop putting it in? (1:21:44–1:22:27)

CRAIG: Demand that your supermarket deliver your food products in paper or just as they come. They don’t need to be wrapped in plastic, and if they are, take the plastic off and leave it with them, and say, “You dispose of it and dispose of it properly.” Because once it becomes their problem, you’ll find that they will do something about it. Don’t put your plastic rubbish in a dumpster, where you know it’s going to landfill. (1:22:59–1:23:53)

1.  What is the gist of these excerpts?

The earth is filling with plastic; we can’t filter it out of the ocean; demand that grocery stores deal with it.

2.  What thoughts or questions do you have about them?

Answers will vary, but may include: It is overwhelming and troubling to know the earth is filling up with plastic. I was wondering whether we can filter it out of the ocean. I am shocked and worried that we can’t. What will happen to all the animals? Will they all die off? What can be done?
