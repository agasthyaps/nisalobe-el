Homework: Reflect on Film and  
Transcript: Lesson 5

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Respond in writing to the following prompts.

1.  In the space below, write a brief paragraph reflecting on what you have seen of the documentary *A Plastic Ocean* so far, including questions you have.

Answers will vary but may include: In this section of the video we saw how difficult it is to buy food at a grocery store or restaurant without encountering plastic. This made me think of how much plastic I deal with in my own life. I never really thought about how so much of the food I get is wrapped in plastic. This made me wonder, what can I do to convince stores to use something besides plastic to wrap food?

2.  Read the following excerpts of the film transcript that you will study in the following lesson. Then respond in writing to the prompts below.

TANYA: We will all be better off if less plastic is manufactured in the first place. Scientists are already calling for governments to reclassify plastic as a hazardous substance because then existing laws about hazardous substances will already be in effect. Plastic bags and water bottles are the worst single-use offenders. What if we ban them outright to stop that vicious cycle? Rwanda is one of the very few countries that has banned plastic bags.

WOMAN: Rwanda being an agricultural country, whereby we don’t have a lot of industries, we have tried to assess the impact of plastic bags on our soil, specifically, and on our animals, specifically livestock, then, after the assessment, we had to say that, “Why do we keep this when we know very well the negative impact of it?” (1:25:41–2:26:41)

**Part A**

What is the gist of this excerpt?

Rwanda assessed the impact of plastic bags; scientists want governments to classify plastic as hazardous; can we ban single-use plastic?

**Part B**

What thoughts or questions do you have about it?

Answers will vary but may include: I am happy to finally see people doing something about plastic pollution. A whole country has banned plastic bags. That’s very encouraging as is the idea that scientists could get governments to classify plastic as hazardous or ban single-use plastics. I do wonder, what can we use instead of plastic?
