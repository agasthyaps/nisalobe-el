<p>How do the techniques in the video add to the meaning of the transcript and help develop ideas?</p>
<p>As the narrator says these words, the video shows <strong>images of plastic goods at the grocery store to illustrate the countless things that come wrapped in plastic.</strong> Then, as the narrator continues to speak, the video shows <strong>images of people picking up plastic from the ground and getting rid of it.</strong> These images help develop the idea that <strong>“it starts with the individual.” In other words, we are responsible for making a change.</strong></p></td>

**Directions:** In the boxes below, record the evidence and reasoning the speaker uses to support the given claim. If a claim has multiple pieces of supporting evidence and reasoning, record them all in the boxes below the claim. Then evaluate whether the evidence is relevant and sufficient and the reasoning is sound, and underline YES or NO in the right-hand column.

<td>The video supports the claim by showing <strong>several scenes of Craig going to different restaurants and stores to try and buy food without plastic.</strong> Almost everywhere Craig goes, <strong>he can only find plastic.</strong> However, he only goes to a few places, so the evidence <strong>is not sufficient to support the claim that “you can’t go anywhere without seeing food wrapped in plastic.”</strong></td>

Who is making the claim, and why? How does this affect your evaluation of the claim?

The narrator of the movie is making the claim to support the idea that it is very difficult to find an alternative to plastic. We know she believes that plastic pollution should be reduced because she helped make the movie. The person making the claim chose which restaurants to go to and how many to visit for gathering evidence, so it does affect our evaluation of the claim.

Evaluate the overall argument in this part of the film. Is the evidence sufficient and relevant? Is the reasoning sound? How do the speaker’s viewpoints influence the strength of the argument?

The claim is that all food comes packaged in plastic. The evidence is relevant because it relates to the topic. However, the evidence is not sufficient because it just shows one person going to several places, and it is not a large enough sample to conclude that plastic is “everywhere.” The reasoning is not sound because the speakers did not gather sufficient evidence. The speakers may be biased because they believe plastic is bad, and they also chose the restaurants to go to, which affects our evaluation of the claim. Therefore, this argument is not very strong since the evidence is insufficient, affecting the reasoning and the overall argument.

**Part III**

**Directions:** Answer the following questions to demonstrate your understanding of the video clip.

1.  Reread this excerpt from the transcript and answer the questions that follow.

MIKE DeGRUY: What do you do? You can’t possibly filter out these tiny particles from the entire ocean. You can’t filter the entire ocean. In fact, so much plastic is in the ocean now in a form that we really can’t get to it that I feel the emphasis needs to immediately shift toward stop putting it in.

CRAIG: Mike DeGruy is right, but how do we get to the point where we can stop putting it in? (1:21:44–1:22:27)

**Part A**

What claim is Craig agreeing with when he says “Mike DeGruy is right”?

2.  We need to discover new ways of recycling plastic.

3.  <u>We need to focus on not putting plastic in the ocean.</u>

4.  We need to find new kinds of plastic that are not toxic.

5.  We need to attempt to take the plastic out of the oceans.

**Part B**

How does the video clarify this idea?

1.  by providing text over the video to explain the situation

2.  by adding music to show that there can be lighter solutions

3.  <u>by showing an animation of plastic straws being removed from the water</u>

4.  by using an interview with a recycling expert to address the problem

<!-- -->

1.  Read the excerpt from the transcript and answer the questions that follow.

CRAIG: Demand that your supermarket deliver your food products in paper or just as they come. They don’t need to be wrapped in plastic, and if they are, take the plastic off and leave it with them, and say, “You dispose of it and dispose of it properly.” Because once it becomes their problem, you’ll find that they will do something about it. Don’t put your plastic rubbish in a dumpster, where you know it’s going to landfill. (1:22:59–1:23:53)

**Part A**

What is the purpose of this section of the video?

1.  <u>to offer advice about how to reduce plastic</u>

2.  to blame viewers for the problem of plastic in the ocean

3.  to offer other viewpoints about whether plastic is a problem

4.  to explain why people value plastic over other kinds of materials

**Part B**

How does the video add to what Craig is saying in the transcript?

1.  by using stories of individuals to show who is to blame

2.  <u>by using images and text to show the size of the problem</u>

3.  by using graphics to explain how most materials are made

4.  by using expert interviews to explain why plastic is misunderstood
