5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

SL.7.1, L.7.1a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

Demand **that your supermarket deliver your food products in paper or just as they come.** (from *A Plastic Ocean*, 1:18:30–1:23:53)

**Lesson 5 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after students analyze the video in Work Time A.

**Rationale**

- Module Guiding Question and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students respond to the guiding question (**What can be done about plastic pollution?**) by providing a specific suggestion for reducing plastic waste. This sentence also helps students address L.7.1a because it contains a complex noun clause that is functioning as a direct object.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it presents a command. It features a word written in the imperative mood followed by a noun clause.

- Transfer: Students use verbs written in the imperative mood to develop suggestions for reducing plastic pollution.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **Demand <u>that your supermarket deliver your food products in paper or just as they come.</u>**

- Ask:

“What is the gist of this sentence?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **that your supermarket deliver your food products in paper or just as they come.**

- Ask:

“How do supermarkets usually deliver food products?” (They usually deliver food products in plastic packaging.)

“Why does the speaker of this sentence want people to demand something different?” (Demanding something different would reduce plastic waste.)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **Demand <u>that your supermarket deliver your food products in paper or just as they come.</u>**

- Ask:

“What does the word demand suggest about the author’s attitudes toward reducing plastic use?” (The use of the word demand suggests that the author thinks it is very important for people to be proactive in supermarkets to avoid plastic waste.)

“What if the author had used the verb ask instead?” (If the author had used the verb ask, it would have suggested that this was more optional and required permission.)

- If time allows, invite students to role-play these two exchanges, taking turns as the supermarket shopper and the supermarket worker. In one role play, the shopper can <u>demand</u> that the supermarket deliver their food products in paper; in the other, the shopper can <u>ask</u> that the products be delivered in paper.

- Ask:

“What kind of clause is this and what is its grammatical function in the sentence? How do you know?” (This is a noun clause and it is functioning as the direct object in the sentence. It is “receiving” the action of the verb demand.)

- Remind students of the sentence they analyzed in a Mini Language Dive from Lesson 3: **Scientists estimate <u>that there are more than five trillion pieces of plastic afloat in our oceans worldwide.</u>**

“How does this structure relate to the structure of this previous Mini Language Dive?” (Both structures feature noun clauses that function as the direct object of the verb.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question What can be done about plastic pollution?” (Responses will vary, but may include: This sentence provides a clear suggestion about something people can do to reduce plastic waste.)
