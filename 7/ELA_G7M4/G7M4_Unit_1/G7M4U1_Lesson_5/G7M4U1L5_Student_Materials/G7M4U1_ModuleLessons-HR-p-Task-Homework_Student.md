2.  Read the following excerpts of the film transcript that you will study in the following lesson. Then respond in writing to the prompts below.

TANYA: We will all be better off if less plastic is manufactured in the first place. Scientists are already calling for governments to reclassify plastic as a hazardous substance because then existing laws about hazardous substances will already be in effect. Plastic bags and water bottles are the worst single-use offenders. What if we ban them outright to stop that vicious cycle? Rwanda is one of the very few countries that has banned plastic bags.

WOMAN: Rwanda being an agricultural country, whereby we don’t have a lot of industries, we have tried to assess the impact of plastic bags on our soil, specifically, and on our animals, specifically livestock, then, after the assessment, we had to say that, “Why do we keep this when we know very well the negative impact of it?” (1:25:41–2:26:41)
