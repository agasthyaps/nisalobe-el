**Part III**

**Directions:** Answer the following questions to demonstrate your understanding of the video clip.

1.  Reread this excerpt from the transcript and answer the questions that follow.

MIKE DeGRUY: What do you do? You can’t possibly filter out these tiny particles from the entire ocean. You can’t filter the entire ocean. In fact, so much plastic is in the ocean now in a form that we really can’t get to it that I feel the emphasis needs to immediately shift toward stop putting it in.

CRAIG: Mike DeGruy is right, but how do we get to the point where we can stop putting it in? (1:21:44–1:22:27)

**Part A**

What claim is Craig agreeing with when he says “Mike DeGruy is right”?

2.  We need to discover new ways of recycling plastic.

3.  We need to focus on not putting plastic in the ocean.

4.  We need to find new kinds of plastic that are not toxic.

5.  We need to attempt to take the plastic out of the oceans.

**Part B**

How does the video clarify this idea?

1.  by providing text over the video to explain the situation

<!-- -->

6.  by adding music to show that there can be lighter solutions

7.  by showing an animation of plastic straws being removed from the water

8.  by using an interview with a recycling expert to address the problem

9.  Read the excerpt from the transcript and answer the questions that follow.

CRAIG: Demand that your supermarket deliver your food products in paper or just as they come. They don’t need to be wrapped in plastic, and if they are, take the plastic off and leave it with them, and say, “You dispose of it and dispose of it properly.” Because once it becomes their problem, you’ll find that they will do something about it. Don’t put your plastic rubbish in a dumpster, where you know it’s going to landfill. (1:22:59–1:23:53)

**Part A**

What is the purpose of this section of the video?

10. to offer advice about how to reduce plastic
