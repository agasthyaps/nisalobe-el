Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- SL.7.3 – Opening A: In an opening activity, students read a particular section of the transcript in *A Plastic Ocean* and delineate the speaker’s claim.

- RI.7.7 – Work Time A: Students watch a clip of *A Plastic Ocean* and compare how the transcript and video portray the subject.

- SL.7.3 – Work Time A: Students watch a clip of *A Plastic Ocean*, delineate the speaker’s argument and claims, and evaluate the soundness of the reasoning and the relevance and sufficiency of the evidence.

- RI.7.10 – Closing and Assessment A: The class launches their independent research reading according to the preferred plan, giving students the opportunity to demonstrate proficient reading and comprehension of nonfiction texts.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners by persevering to evaluate the argument by reading and answering questions independently. Students also work to become ethical people by behaving with integrity and answering questions independently.

- The Think-Pair-Share protocol is used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- In the clip of *A Plastic Ocean* watched in this lesson, Rose Mukankomeje, the director general of the Rwanda Environmental Management Authority, and citizens of Rwanda demonstrate working to make the world a better place through helping the environment by banning plastic bags.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Invite students to develop an interactive word wall of the concepts studied thus far. After creating the word wall, invite these students to lead the class in the Interactive Word Wall protocol. (Consult the EL Classroom Protocol document located on the Tools Page at http://eled.org/tools as necessary.)

- Rewatch clips of the film through the lens of bias and perspective. Analyze each speaker’s argument and specific claims, naming the perspective they are discussing. Evaluate the soundness of the reasoning and the relevance and sufficiency of the evidence, considering their particular bias. Create a counterclaim and counter-argument to the film’s perspective.

- For each of the Opening activity cards, students can identify and evaluate the relevance and sufficiency of evidence, the soundness of reasoning, and the speaker’s bias.

- Have students choose a plastic pollution topic that concerns them. Come up with a plan to address this concern, spread awareness, and effect change in their school or community.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students have focused on analyzing the film *A Plastic Ocean* for argument and comparing and contrasting the film to the transcript. In this lesson, students watch a clip of *A Plastic Ocean* and independently delineate the speaker’s argument and claims, evaluating the soundness of the reasoning and the relevance and sufficiency of the evidence.

Support All Students

- The subject matter in this film includes descriptions of the environmental impact of plastic pollution, such as harm to animals and humans. Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this chapter that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually. To support students in processing this content, ask: “What habit of character did you use as you watched and discussed this film?” Students may need to draw on perseverance, empathy, and compassion as they read and discuss this content, being sensitive to their own and others’ reactions to the information presented.

- Students may need additional support with reading and analyzing the argument in the Opening activity. Encourage students to work in pairs to read the transcript excerpt and identify the claim together, then sharing their responses with another student or pair of students. ▲

- Note there is a differentiated version of the Analyze *A Plastic Ocean* (1:25:41–1:26:46) note-catcher used in Work Time B in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Students may need additional support identifying the argument in the film clip. Provide students with individual devices and headphones to watch and rewatch the clip at their own pace, pausing where necessary. Consider using cardboard or file folder “offices” to limit distractions, and provide movement breaks where necessary. Pull small groups or work one-on-one with students to support them with filling in the note-catcher. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson provides students the same routine and note-catcher they have used throughout the unit to independently analyze a film clip.

- ELLs may find it challenging to gradually release from small group work to independent analysis of the film clip. If so, draw these students together into a small group and guide them to grapple independently with each section of the note-catcher. Then review their responses before they move on to grapple independently with the next section of the note-catcher. Doing so will allow students to check their responses and ensure their comprehension before they get too far off track. At the end of Work Time A, collect students’ note-catchers to review them as a formative assessment to ensure students are ready for the mid-unit assessment in the following lesson. If not, spend another lesson on analyzing the techniques and argument of film clips.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, 7.I.B.6, 7.I.C.10, and 7.I.C.11.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Analyze *A Plastic Ocean* (1:25:41–1:26:46) note-catcher to ensure students understand how to delineate the speaker’s argument and claims, and evaluate the soundness of the reasoning and the relevance and sufficiency of the evidence.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will demonstrate their skills in comparing the transcript and the film and evaluating an argument by watching and analyzing a film clip, completing a note-catcher, and answering selected response and constructed response questions independently for the mid-unit assessment.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – SL.7.3 (5 minutes)

- As students enter class, hand each student a **Card Swap card**. If students enter class at different times, write the directions on the board. If students enter class at the same time, model the activity, explaining that students each meet with a partner. They take turns reading their transcript paragraphs from the film *A Plastic Ocean* and identifying the speaker’s claim.

- Then, they swap cards with their partner and find a new partner, repeating the process with their partner’s paragraph.

- Ask:

“What are some norms and habits of character we need to keep in mind as we do this activity?” (Staying on task, working quickly, being responsible, showing initiative, and collaborating.)

- As time allows, direct students to participate in several rounds of the Card Swap activity.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

- In Opening A, students may need additional time to comprehend the transcript excerpts and identify the claims. Allow for extra wait time and encourage students to highlight key words and phrases in the excerpt to assist them in identifying the claim. As necessary, prompt students with questions such as the following:

- What is the gist of this excerpt? Which line tells the main claim or opinion? Can you paraphrase that in your own words?

For Heavier Support

- In Opening A, students may need support to comprehend the transcript excerpts and identify the claims. Allow students to work in pairs to highlight key words and phrases in the excerpt and to identify the claim. As necessary, prompt students with questions such as the following:

- What is the gist of this excerpt? Which line tells the main claim or opinion? Can you paraphrase that in your own words?

Work Time

A. Delineate and Evaluate a Speaker’s Argument – RI.7.7, SL.7.3 (25 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can compare the way a transcript of *A Plastic Ocean* portrays a subject to the way it is portrayed in the video.”

“I can delineate a speaker’s argument and claims in *A Plastic Ocean*.”

“I can evaluate a speaker’s evidence and reasoning in *A Plastic Ocean*.”

- Inform students that they will be viewing another clip from ***A Plastic Ocean***. In this lesson, students will analyze the clip on their note-catchers independently and answer questions about the clip independently.

- Distribute the **Analyze *A Plastic Ocean*** **(1:25:41–1:26:46) note-catcher** and the **Analyze *A Plastic Ocean*** **(1:25:41–1:26:46) note-catcher** ▲ as necessary. The differentiated note-catcher supports students’ comprehension and writing with sentence starters. ▲ As necessary, note that this note-catcher is the same as the ones they have used in previous lessons. Reference the **Analyze *A Plastic Ocean*** **(1:25:41–1:26:46) note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** for example student answers.

- Play the clip of *A Plastic Ocean* (1:23:59–1:26:46) one time, to watch for enjoyment. Then, play the clip a second time, and ask students to individually note the gist, main ideas, and techniques of the clip in Part I of the note-catcher. Finally, play the clip a third time, and ask students to identify the claim and the evidence and reasoning that support the claim. Direct students to complete Part II of the note-catcher.

- If students need support in identifying the claim, ask:

“What is the film claiming about a plastic pollution solution with the example of Germany and Rwanda? Who is solving the problem? How?” (Laws can limit the use of plastic. Governments can make plastic-producing companies responsible for setting up recycling systems. Or governments can ban plastic bags.)▲

- Then, direct students’ attention to Part III of the note-catcher. Invite students to answer the questions about the clip in Part III of the note-catcher. Using **equity sticks**, briefly review responses, correcting misconceptions if needed.

- Once students have finished watching and analyzing the film clip, ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What habits of character did you see in this film clip? Who demonstrated them? What did they look/sound like?” (Answers will vary, but may include: The government, plastic producers, and consumers of Germany demonstrate contributing to make the world a better place through helping the environment by creating a recycling system. Also, Rwandan citizens in general demonstrate making the world a better place through helping the environment by banning plastic bags.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- For Work Time A, explain to students that completing the analysis and note-catcher independently will prepare them for doing so on their assessment in the following lesson. Remind students that they have completed similar analysis and note-catchers throughout the unit and are prepared for this challenge.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time A, assess whether students need the support of the Analyze *A Plastic Ocean* (1:25:41–1:26:46) note-catcher ▲. This resource features sentence starters that support students with comprehension and writing. If students can forgo using this support, they will grow in independence and achievement for similar analysis tasks on assessments.

Closing and Assessment

A. Launch Independent Research Reading – RI.7.10 (15 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can select a research reading text that I want to read.”

- Launch independent reading for this module. There is a suggested independent reading launch in **Independent Reading Sample Plans** (see the Tools page, http://eled.org/tools). Remind students that they were introduced to independent research reading in Module 1.

- Remind students they will use their **independent research reading journals** to log their independent reading, both choice and research reading, and to answer reading prompts.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- After the Independent Research Reading launch, allocate time for debriefing. Invite students to discuss with partners the value of independent research reading and set goals for this module’s reading. Reflection and goal-setting will increase student-engagement with and appreciation for independent research reading.

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from the transcript of *A Plastic Ocean*. Provide ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Invite students to predict some of the questions that the Language Dive may ask. This will improve students’ metacognition and challenge their awareness of the most interesting or meaningful elements of the sentence.

For Heavier Support

- After the Independent Research Reading launch, ensure students understand the purpose of independent research reading is to read on-level texts in order to increase their knowledge of and engagement with the topic of plastic pollution. Explain that reading many texts at their level about one topic increases their reading, vocabulary, and analysis skills. Then invite students to discuss with partners the value of independent research reading and set goals for this module’s reading. Reflection and goal-setting will increase student engagement with and appreciation for Independent Research Reading.

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from the transcript of *A Plastic Ocean*. Provide ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Encourage students to independently reflect on this sentence and its meaning before the next lesson. Students may also wish to use dictionaries to add any unknown vocabulary and meanings to their **vocabulary logs**.

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
