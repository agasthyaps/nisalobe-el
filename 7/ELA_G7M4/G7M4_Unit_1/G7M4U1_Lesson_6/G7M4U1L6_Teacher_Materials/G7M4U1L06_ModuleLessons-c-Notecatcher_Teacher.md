<p><strong>We will all be better off if less plastic is used in the first place.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Plastic should be reclassified as a hazardous substance.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Rwanda is one of the very few countries that have banned plastic bags.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rwanda assessed the impact of plastic on soil and livestock and discovered the negative impact.</strong></p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT: Rwanda being an agricultural country, whereby we don’t have a lot of industries, we have tried to assess the impact of plastic bags on our soil, specifically, and on our animals, specifically livestock, then, after the assessment, we had to say that, “Why do we keep this when we know very well the negative impact of it?” (2:26:13–2:26:41)</p>
<p>How do the techniques in the video add to the meaning of the transcript and help develop ideas?</p>
<p>The images of German plastic producers and recycling show <strong>how the systems in Germany work.</strong> The images of Rwanda’s agricultural landscape, children, and people emphasize <strong>Rose’s question, “Why do we keep [plastic] when we know very well the negative impact of it?”</strong> These images of nature in Rwanda help the viewer <strong>recognize the natural beauty of Rwanda and how easily too much plastic could destroy it.</strong></p></td>

**Directions:** In the boxes below, record the evidence and reasoning the author uses to support the given claim. If a claim has multiple pieces of supporting evidence and reasoning, record them all in the boxes below the claim. Then evaluate whether the evidence is relevant and sufficient and the reasoning is sound, and underline YES or NO in the right-hand column.

<td>The video supports the claim by showing <strong>and explaining how Germany passed laws to make plastic producing companies set up recycling systems.</strong> Also, the discussion by Rose Mukankomeje <strong>explains why Rwanda banned plastic bags.</strong> There are also images of <strong>Rwanda’s clean, lush environment, showing what it’s like without plastic bags.</strong></td>

Who is making the claim, and why? How does this affect your evaluation of the claim?

Craig states the claim that governments should pass laws to control plastic pollution. It is not surprising that he thinks laws are needed to help limit the use of plastic because he thinks plastic is bad. However, the examples do show that government regulations can help limit or recycle the use of plastic.

Evaluate the overall argument in this part of the film. Is the evidence sufficient and relevant? Is the reasoning sound? How does the speaker’s viewpoint influence the strength of the argument?

The claim is that laws can limit plastic pollution. The evidence is relevant because it relates directly to the topic. The evidence is sufficient because as it shows two countries limiting plastic pollution through laws. The reasoning is sound because the speaker explains the connection between the laws and the results. The speakers may be biased because they believe plastic is bad and governments should help. However, the argument is still strong because the evidence and reasoning show that laws help limit plastic pollution.

**Part III**

**Directions:** Read the transcript, and then answer the following questions to demonstrate your understanding of the video clip.

1.  How do the images of Rwandans making paper bags support Tanya’s ideas?

2.  Showing paper instead of plastic supports her idea of agriculture in Rwanda.

3.  Showing paper instead of plastic supports her idea of the importance of jobs.

4.  <u>Showing paper instead of plastic supports her idea of manufacturing less plastic.</u>

5.  Showing paper instead of plastic supports her idea of manufacturing more plastic.

6.  How do the images of Rwanda’s landscape support Rose’s ideas?

7.  Showing the landscape supports her idea that plastic negatively impacts people.

8.  <u>Showing the landscape supports her idea that agriculture is an important industry.</u>

9.  Showing the landscape supports her idea that plastic negatively impacts agriculture.

10. Showing the landscape supports her idea that paper production is an important industry.
