Card Swap Cards

SL.7.3

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Teacher Directions:** Cut apart the cards ahead of time, and provide one card per student, making as many copies of these excerpts as is necessary. Students will meet with a partner. They will silently read the paragraph from the film *A Plastic Ocean*. They will share their paragraphs’ claim. Then, students will hear their partner’s claim. Then, students swap cards with their partners and find a new partner.

<td><p>Plastic production globally is expected to be more than 300 million tons, half of which we’ll use just once . . . and then throw away. By 2050, when the population explodes to almost ten billion people, it’s expected that plastic production will triple. The problem with that is that today only a fraction of the plastic that we produce is recycled. The rest ends up in our environment, and it’s coating our land and our oceans like a disease. (15:24–15:54)</p>
<p>Claim:</p>
<p><strong>Plastic is a problem because only a fraction is recycled and the rest ends up in the environment.</strong></p></td>
<td><p>TANYA: Scientists estimate that there are more than five trillion pieces of plastic afloat in our oceans worldwide.</p>
<p>CRAIG: There is no floating island of plastic. What exists is far more insidious. What exists is a kind of plastic smog. These tiny pieces of plastic that are floating on the surface of the ocean come from larger pieces. Over time, the sun’s ultraviolet light, ocean wave action, and salt break it up into smaller pieces called microplastics. Microplastics have rough, pitted surfaces. Waterborne chemicals from industry and agriculture stick to microplastics, making them toxic poison pills. (27:27–28:14)</p>
<p>Claim:</p>
<p><strong>Plastic in the ocean is terrible because it breaks into microplastics that become poisonous.</strong></p></td>

<td><p>CRAIG: We put a call to action out on Facebook: Go to your local beach, this is what you’re looking for. These are the bags, these are the pellets.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Sinopec sent down people from their head offices. They had general managers on the beaches.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Once you let people know what the problem is, people have their own ideas and can contribute their own ingenuity to help solve the problem. The people of Hong Kong realized the severity of the problem, and just came out in their masses to help, and that is something that I will never, ever forget. (39:11–40:29)</p>
<p>Claim:</p>
<p><strong>People will help once you let them know what the problem is.</strong></p></td>
<td><p>TANYA: You can’t go anywhere without seeing food wrapped in plastic. You can’t go to a restaurant without, you know, takeout boxes being in plastic, hot foods going into plastic. You can’t go to a restaurant without, you know, takeout boxes being in plastic, hot foods going into plastic. My answer there is, well, demand safer plastic. (1:18:30–1:18:33)</p>
<p>Claim:</p>
<p><strong>Everywhere you go, food is wrapped in plastic.</strong></p></td>
