<p><strong>Plastic is found all over the ocean; we need to find new ways to stop plastic from getting into the ocean.</strong></p></th>

<td><p>Central Ideas:</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> One central idea is that plastic can move through the food chain in the ocean.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Another central idea is that <strong>when people eat seafood, they also eat the plastic and the harmful chemicals it attracts. A lot of plastic comes into the ocean because it is not disposed of properly.</strong></p></td>
<td colspan="2"><p>How the Central Ideas Are Developed (include experts quoted, studies named, statistics named, counterarguments addressed, and questions or comments discussed):</p>
<p><strong>• Quotes scientists to explain how plastic travels up the food chain; describes a video of a zooplankton eating a tiny piece of plastic; quotes Richard Kirby: “Here was something, visually, to convey to the public the problem of plastic in the sea” (37).</strong></p>
<p><strong>• “Dangerous chemicals hide inside meals of microplastics” (39). PCBs from TVs and fridges; DDT from pesticides; BPA in plastics</strong></p>
<p><strong>• Uses experts to explain how trash gets into the ocean: Matt Prindiville: “we have rivers of plastic that are literally flowing into the ocean” because the plastic is not taken care of; includes statistics to develop this central idea: “trucks dump 6,890 tons” of trash into just one landfill.</strong></p></td>

<td colspan="3"><p>The Author’s Purpose (this may be to engage, provide information, persuade, or for some other purpose you determine) and How it Adds to the Text, Overall Excerpt:</p>
<p><strong>To explain how plastic affects animals in the ocean and how plastic gets into the ocean in the first place. It adds to the text by explaining how serious the problem of plastic pollution is for animals and humans, showing that plastic pollution anywhere will eventually affect everyone.</strong></p></td>

<tr class="odd">
<td colspan="2"><p>The Author’s Point of View on Page 42:</p>
<p><strong>The author seems to think it is a problem that all this plastic goes into these countries. The author uses words like “flood” and images and information about children living and working on trash heaps to show that she disapproves.</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Others’ Points of View and Page Numbers:</p>
<p><strong>“It’s really about fairness,” Matt Prindiville says. “When consumer goods companies sell all of their products” to countries that cannot dispose of it or recycle it properly, “we have rivers of plastic that are literally flowing into the ocean.” (42)</strong></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td colspan="3"><p>How the Author Distinguishes Her Point of View from Others:</p>
<p>The author presents an expert’s point of view<strong>: “It’s really about fairness,” Matt Prindiville says. “When consumer goods companies sell all of their products” to countries that cannot dispose of it or recycle properly, “we have rivers of plastic that are literally flowing into the ocean.”</strong> However, the author doesn’t distinguish her point of view from <strong>others in this excerpt.</strong> She uses the expert’s quotes to <strong>support her own point of view.</strong></p></td>
