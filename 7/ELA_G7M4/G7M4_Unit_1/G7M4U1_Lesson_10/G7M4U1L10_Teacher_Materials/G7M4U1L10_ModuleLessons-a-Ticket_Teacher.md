Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 10

RI.7.6, L.7.4

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, respond in writing to the following prompts.

Which picture or graphic from Chapter 3 do you find most intriguing or helpful for understanding the text and why? What do you think the author’s purpose was in selecting this picture or graphic?

I think the picture on page 37 is most helpful for understanding the text because it showed a small organism, a larval perch, that I wasn’t familiar with. This helped explain how tiny the creatures are that swallow microplastics, which is why I think the author included it.

On the lines below, list several vocabulary words you identified in Chapter 3 and their meanings.

Answers will vary, but may include:

gauging (36): measuring

zooplankton (37): tiny animals in the large bodies of water

insecticide (40): chemicals to kill insects

infrastructure (42): the basic facilities needed to keep a system running
