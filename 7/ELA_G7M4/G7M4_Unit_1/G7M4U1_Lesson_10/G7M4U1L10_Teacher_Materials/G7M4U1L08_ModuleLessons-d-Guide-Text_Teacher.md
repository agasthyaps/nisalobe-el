(For Teacher Reference)

This guide is meant to support in-class reading of *Trash Vortex* by providing comprehension questions and examples of vocabulary with which students may struggle. Students should provide evidence from the text to support their responses to the questions.

**Unit 1**

**Lesson 8, Chapter 1**

**From the beginning of the text to page 10: “every square mile of the world’s beaches”**

**Vocabulary**

- cargo (4): the goods carried by a ship

- buoyant (8): able to float

- gyre (8): a circular or spiral path or motion (of the ocean)

- brittle (8): easily broken

- jostle (8): push or crowd

**Questions**

- page 4 “and west to begin the cycle again.”

> **Why do sailors avoid the North Pacific Ocean? The wind is too calm to move their sailboats.**

- page 6 “surface waters of the deep, remote ocean.”

> **What did Charles Moore discover at the center of the gyre? He discovered a huge amount of tiny plastic pieces floating. “they were always there: plastic shards,” he said, about all the plastic he saw (6).**

- page 10 “every square mile of the world’s beaches.”

> **How do the gyres affect the plastic in the ocean? The gyres help to bring the plastic together into one spot. They also help to break the plastic down. Moore even compares it to a toilet bowl. “But it never flushes,” he said. “It just keeps adding and adding” (8).**

**Lesson 9, Chapter 2**

**Pages 22–25 (from “Beginning in the 1950s . . .” to “. . . Now we know better”)**

**Vocabulary**

- inert (25): not being able to act or move

- benign (25): not harmful

**Questions**

- page 22 “with the first artificial heart”

> **What is the effect of the author listing all these uses of plastic in this paragraph? It shows how popular plastic had become and how it affected almost all aspects of life.**

- page 24 *“A Social History of Trash”*

> **How did people treat plastic differently than other materials, and why? They did not reuse plastic, because it “sometimes became cheaper to buy new plastic goods than repair old ones” (24).**

- page 25 “Now we know better.”

> **What does Moore mean when he says “now we know better”? He means that now that we know about the harm plastic causes, we are more bothered by all of it in our environment.**

**Lesson 10, Chapter 3**

**Pages 36–43 (from “Scientists gauging the amount of plastic . . .” to “. . . communities far upstream as well”)**

**Vocabulary**

- gauging (36): measuring

- zooplankton (37): tiny animals in the large bodies of water

- insecticide (40): chemicals to kill insects

- infrastructure (42): the basic facilities needed to keep a system running

**Questions**

- page 36 “sunk to the seafloor, or been eaten.”

> **Why is there so much plastic in the ocean that scientists can’t find? Scientists can’t find it because “most of plastic becomes microplastic” (36). Then, these tiny pieces either sink or are eaten by marine life.**

- page 40 “below the surface of the Pacific Ocean”

> **How do PCBs and DDT make plastics more dangerous? These harmful chemicals “attach to tiny plastic rafts for a ride” (38) into the ocean.**

- page 42 “flowing into the ocean.”

> **What is the danger of having “no waste management system”? With no waste management system, trash, including plastic, flows into the ocean. As Matt Prindiville says, “We have rivers of plastic that are literally flowing into the ocean” (42).**

**Lesson 11, Chapter 4**

**Vocabulary**

- expedition (36): journey

**Questions**

- page 44 “Kerry Howell of England’s Plymouth University.”

> **What did scientists discover about plastic pollution? They discovered that most plastic has become trash instead of being reused and that a “great deal of this plastic pollution is in the ocean” (44). They found that “human litter is present in all marine habitats” (44).**

- page 47 “that are happily growing on this material.”

> **What do the decomposers do with plastic? Why are scientists interested in them? The decomposers feed on plastic and break them down. Animals such as mealworms “willingly feast on plastic foam” (46). Scientists are interested in decomposers as a possible solution to the plastic pollution problem.**

- page 50 “It must stop.”

> **What is the UN asking countries to do, and why? The UN is asking countries to “join the battle against single-use plastics” (48). The organization hopes to reduce plastic pollution at the source by preventing its production in the first place.**
