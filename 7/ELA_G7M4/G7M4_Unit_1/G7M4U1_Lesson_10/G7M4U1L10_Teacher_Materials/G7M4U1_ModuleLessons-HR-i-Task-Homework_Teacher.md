19. Write a brief objective summary of chapter 3 of *Trash Vortex*. Be sure to include two central ideas and how they are developed in the text. (RI.7.2)

Chapter 3 of *Trash Vortex* talks about the harm that plastic does to sea life and how it gets into the ocean. The author describes how plastic is found everywhere. Then small animals eat the plastic and are eaten by bigger animals so that the plastic travels up the food chain. These examples develop the central idea that plastic causes great harm to ocean life. Another central idea is that plastic has many ways of getting into the ocean, from escaping from our clothes into the washing machine and coming from landfills that are not built properly. The author develops this central idea by describing how small some of the plastic is and the places where it flows into the ocean. Together these details develop the central ideas that plastic travels up the food chain and gets into our oceans through improper disposal.
