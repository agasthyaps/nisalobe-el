Track Progress: Read, Understand,  
and Explain New Text

**Name:** **Date:**

**Learning Target:** I can independently read, understand, and explain the meaning of a new text.

**Standards I’m Tracking:** RI.7.1, RI.7.4, RI.7.10, L.7.4

**Text Type (underline):** Informative Story Poem Play/Readers Theater

1.  How am I doing?

- For each criterion, self-assess by putting a check mark in the appropriate column.

- Write the number of each standard on a sticky note or flag. Then, in your assessment materials, place each sticky note in an area that shows evidence you have met that criterion. This might be next to a selected response question or a short piece of writing. Make sure you have evidence for each criterion.

- Strive to be honest with yourself. Remember, your ability grows with your effort, so it’s fine if you aren’t there yet!

You will receive feedback on different colored sticky notes/flags, and in a different colored pen on the checklist.
