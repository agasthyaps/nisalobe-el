Opening Activity: The Human Timeline

RI.7.10

**Note to Teacher:** Cut apart the cards, and provide a card for each student. If there are not enough cards for all students, have students partner up, with some reading the year while others read the text; or create two sets of these cards and two Human Timelines, with one group in the classroom and the other in the hallway; or have groups take turns.
