27. In the space below, write an objective summary of pages 50–55 of *Trash Vortex*. Be sure to include two central ideas and explain how they are developed in the text. (RI.7.1, RI.7.2)

To score this response, use the Informational Summary Rubric and the following sample response:

In pages 49–55 of *Trash Vortex*, Danielle Smith-Llera discusses what can be done to reduce plastic pollution. One of the central ideas is that reducing our waste might be the best way to fight plastic pollution. After discussing efforts to ban or reduce plastic specifically, the author explains why being careful about what we use may be our best option. She writes, “but what if cleaning up the ocean does not require a war on plastic but rather a war on litter?” (52) With this sentence, she means that it may be possible to keep our oceans clean by not wasting so much. She then quotes experts who talk about how to reduce what we use and reuse things in new ways. This helps develop another central idea, which is that we can all do something to reduce plastic pollution. To further develop this idea, the author gives examples of things that everyone can do, such as use refillable water bottles and “take cloth bags to fill at the grocery store” (50–51). Then, she quotes an expert who says “\[e\]ven small things make a difference” (55). These quotes, details, and examples develop the central ideas that reducing our waste might be the best way to support reducing plastic pollution.
