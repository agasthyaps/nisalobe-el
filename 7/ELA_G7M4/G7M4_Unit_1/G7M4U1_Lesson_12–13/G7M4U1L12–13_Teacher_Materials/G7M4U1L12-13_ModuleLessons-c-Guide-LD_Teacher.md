Launch

Remind students that they have been focusing on central ideas throughout this module and analyzing their development over the course of *Trash Vortex*. Display the previous Language Dive sentence from Module 4, Unit 1, Lesson 7 (**Through the Plastic Bank, we make plastic waste a currency, so that people in developing countries can earn an income, while preventing plastic from entering the ocean**), and invite students to consider how the central idea in today’s Language Dive sentence connects to the central idea in the Lesson 7 Language Dive.

But

Deconstruct

- Ask:

“Can you figure out why the author wrote but?” (But connects this sentence to the previous idea in the text, and signals that this sentence will provide a contrasting idea.)

- Invite students to take 30 seconds in pairs to discuss the idea presented previously in the text (**that many countries are banning plastic in order to save the oceans from plastic waste**) and then predict what contrasting idea might be presented in this sentence. (Answers will vary, but may include that instead of banning plastic altogether, we should focus on reusing the plastic that already exists.)

what if cleaning up the ocean does not require a war on plastic

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- **what if**

“What do you think the phrase what if means? Can we use the meaning of the individual words to help us understand this phrase?” (What if is an expression that is short for “what would happen if?” This phrase is often used to present a possibility that is different from an existing situation or idea, or to suggest a different way of thinking. The word if can help us understand this phrase because if is often used to talk about new possibilities that might happen or might be true, and the word what is a question word that helps us understand this phrase is meant to make us ponder.)

“What new possibility does this chunk suggest we ponder?” (That perhaps cleaning up the ocean does not require a war on plastic, as suggested previously in the text.)

- **a war on plastic**

“What is another way to say a war on plastic? Is the author using literal or figurative language?” (Answers will vary, but may include: Another way to say a war on plastic is “a battle against plastic waste.” The author is using figurative language to create a sense of urgency around the problem of plastic waste in our country. Just as war requires many people to fight together against a common foe, battling plastic waste in our country also requires many people to rally around the cause. \[noun phrase\])

- Students can discuss in pairs some of the actions people are taking to “fight the war on plastic pollution,” as mentioned on the previous two pages (pages 50–51 of *Trash Vortex*). Encourage students to refer to the text to support their discussion. (Answers will vary, but may include: People drink from refillable water bottles and take cloth bags to fill at the grocery store. Countries tax plastic bags to encourage shoppers to use fewer of them. Some restaurants are banning plastic straws.)

- Then students can discuss why the author might be suggesting another way to tackle the problem of plastic waste. (Answers will vary, but may include that perhaps it is important to consider what to do with the plastic that is already here.)

- **Students can use Conversation Cues as they discuss. To provide heavier support, display a suggested sequence, such as the one below:**

- Let’s take time to think and write or sketch. (Goal 1)

- Can you say more about that? (Goal 1)

- Who can add on to what your classmate said? I’ll give you time to think. (Goal 4)

- How is what \_\_\_\_\_ said the same as/different from what \_\_\_\_\_ said? (Goal 4)

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Students can complete the following sentence frame to suggest a different way of thinking about a habit of character.

> **What if \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ does not require \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?**

noun phrase incorporating a habit of character noun phrase

but rather

Deconstruct

- **but rather**

“What does the phrase but rather tell us about this chunk?” (But tells us there will be some kind of contrast or contradiction between the previous chunk and the subsequent chunk; rather provides emphasis to this contrast—that what follows will express not only contradiction, but an opposite idea to the idea presented earlier. Note that the words not and but rather often go together in a sentence. not + \[verb or noun phrase\] + but rather + \[verb or noun phrase\])

- Invite students to take 30 seconds in pairs to discuss the previous chunk (**what if cleaning up the ocean does not require a war on plastic**) and then predict what contrasting/opposite idea might be presented in the subsequent chunk. (Answers will vary, but may include a similar discussion to the one students engaged in in the first chunk: instead of “a war on plastic,” we should focus on reusing the plastic that already exists.)

“Can you say more about that?” (Answers will vary.)

a war on litter?

Deconstruct

- Ask:

“What might we consider focusing on to clean up the ocean, rather than a war on plastic?” (A war on litter.)

- **litter**

“What do we think the word litter means?” (Litter means pieces of garbage, such as cans and plastic and paper waste, that people throw away and leave on the ground in a public place.)

- **a war on litter**

“What is another way to say a war on litter? Is the author using literal or figurative language?” (Answers will vary, but may include: Another way to say a war on litter is “stopping people from throwing away garbage and leaving it on the ground in a public place.” The author is using figurative language to create a sense of urgency around the problem of litter in our country. The author is saying that just as war requires many people to fight together against a common foe, battling the problem of litter in our country also requires many people to rally around the cause. \[noun phrase\])

- Students can discuss in pairs some of the actions people could take during a war on litter. Encourage students to refer to the text to support their discussion (pages 52–55 of *Trash Vortex*). (Answers will vary, but may include: Recycled plastic items can be turned into playground equipment. Recycled plastic bags can be used to create asphalt for paving city streets. Plastics provide materials for construction, medical equipment, cars.)

But what if cleaning up the ocean does not require a war on plastic but rather a war on litter?

Reconstruct

- **But <u>what if</u> cleaning up the ocean does not require a war on plastic but rather a war on litter?**

“How can we say this sentence in a more literal way?” (Answers will vary, but may include: But what if cleaning up the ocean does not require banning plastic, but making sure we reuse and recycle the plastic that is already in circulation.)

“How does this sentence help us determine the author’s point of view, as distinguished from the point of view of others?” (This sentence helps us understand that the author thinks it may be possible to keep our oceans clean by not wasting so much, which varies from the point of view of others who suggest the solution to keeping our oceans clean is banning plastic altogether.)

“What do you think about the author’s point of view? Do you agree or disagree with the author? Why?” (Answers will vary)

“How does this sentence connect to the previous Language Dive sentence in Module 4, Unit 1, Lesson 7: Through the Plastic Bank, we make plastic waste a currency, so that people in developing countries can earn an income, while preventing plastic from entering the ocean?” (Both sentences focus on the central idea that recycling plastic waste may be one of the best ways to fight plastic pollution.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Answers will vary)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question:  
What can be done about plastic pollution? What is being done?” (Answers will vary)

Practice (Sentence)

- Students can complete the following sentence frame to rewrite this sentence using more literal language. 

**But what if cleaning up the ocean does not require \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ but**

noun phrase

**rather \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?**

noun phrase

> (e.g., But what if cleaning up the ocean did not require <u>producing less plastic</u> but rather <u>recycling and reusing the plastic we already have</u>?)

- To provide lighter support: Can we divide this sentence into two or more sentences? What would we have to remove or change?

- To provide heavier support: Invite students to discuss in pairs varying ways to say each noun phrase before beginning to write.
