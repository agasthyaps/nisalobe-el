Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- SL.7.2 – Opening A: On an entrance ticket, students cite several pieces of evidence and notice details in order to infer the meaning of a picture.

- RI.7.6 – Work Time A: Students determine Danielle Smith-Llera’s point of view and purpose in a text and analyze how she distinguishes her position from that of others.

- RI.7.6 – Closing and Assessment A: In a collaborative discussion, students discuss Danielle Smith-Llera’s point of view and analyze how she distinguishes her position from that of others.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners by persevering independently through reading and answering questions, and collaborating with peers and taking initiative during the discussion. They also work to become ethical people by being respectful during the discussion.

- The Close Viewing, Think-Pair-Share, and Collaborative Discussionprotocols are used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- Students engage in the following new protocol in this lesson (instructions for which appear on the entrance ticket and in the Classroom Protocols document located on the Tools Page: http://eled.org/tools):

- **Close Viewing** helps students focus on the details in a picture, photograph, or illustration in an effort to add to their growing understanding of a given text or topic. It is designed to provide time for students to talk through their ideas with a partner.

- In the excerpt of *Trash Vortex* read in this lesson, the scientists and experts interviewed demonstrate contributing to a better world by applying their learning to help the environment.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Allow students who are able to cite several pieces of evidence and notice details to infer the meaning of the picture to create another Close Viewing protocol, using an image of their choosing from *Trash Vortex* or *A Plastic Ocean*.

- Invite students to create their own note-catcher while reading to analyze the author’s point of view and purpose.

- Invite students to rewrite sections of the text where the author quotes experts, instead turning these quotation sections as if they were the words of Danielle Smith-Llera, giving her point of view and for her purpose.

- Prompt students to find the counter-argument to claims made in this text. Encourage students to research the other perspective and present findings to the class.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students have focused on determining two or more central ideas, analyzing the development of these ideas, and analyzing the author’s point of view and purpose and how she distinguishes her position from others. In this lesson, students will continue this analysis of the central ideas and the author’s point of view and purpose independently, and then discuss their analysis in a collaborative discussion.

Support All Students

- At this point, students should be reading the text independently. However, if some or all students need more support, read several pages aloud and then release students to read independently, in pairs, or in small groups. Alternatively, provide an audio version of the text. ▲

- This excerpt includes descriptions of plastic pollution and its effects on marine life. Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this chapter that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually. To support students in processing this content, ask: “What habit of character did you use as you read and discussed this excerpt?” Students may need to draw on perseverance, empathy, and compassion as they read and discuss this content, being sensitive to their own and others’ reactions to the information. ▲

- If students are unsure as to how to identify and articulate central ideas, point of view, and author’s purpose, model and practice this with students one-on-one or in small groups, as needed. ▲

- Note there is a differentiated version of the Author’s Point of View and Purpose: *Trash Vortex*, Chapter 4 note-catcher used in Work Time B in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson provides students the same routines and note-catcher they have used throughout the unit to independently analyze the central ideas and the author’s point of view and purpose in the anchor text *Trash Vortex*.

- ELLs may find it challenging to gradually release from small group work to independent analysis of the anchor text. If so, draw these students together into a small group and guide them to grapple independently with each section of the note-catcher. Then review their responses before they move on to grapple independently with the next section of the note-catcher. Doing so will allow students to check their responses and ensure their comprehension before they get too far off track. At the end of Work Time A, collect students’ note-catchers in order to review them as a formative assessment to ensure students are ready for the end of unit assessment in the following lesson. If not, spend another lesson on analyzing the central ideas and author’s point of view and purpose.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, 7.I.B.6, and 7.I.C.10.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Author’s Point of View and Purpose: *Trash Vortex*, Chapter 4 note-catcher to ensure students understand how the author develops her point of view and purpose in the excerpt and how she distinguishes her position from that of others.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will take the end of unit assessment and determine the central ideas, noting their development over the course of the text as they analyze the author’s point of view and purpose.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – SL.7.2 (10 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 11**.

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, partner students with their Close Viewing protocol partners.

- Direct students to discuss with their partners:

“Which details did you notice?” (Answers will vary.)

“What did you learn or infer from those details?” (Answers will vary.)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

- For the entrance ticket in Opening A, allow students to respond to the prompts in the modality that best suits them. They may want to record their responses in writing or practice their oral responses with a partner before writing them. Allowing students to respond in multiple ways increases their confidence and success in analyzing an image.

For Heavier Support

- For the entrance ticket in Opening A, allow students to respond to the prompts in the modality that best suits them. They may want to record their responses in writing or practice their oral responses with a partner before writing them. They may want to share their responses in their home language. Allowing students to respond in multiple ways increases their confidence and success in analyzing an image.

Work Time

A. Read and Analyze *Trash Vortex* – RI.7.6 (25 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can determine two or more central ideas and analyze their development over the course of *Trash Vortex*.”

“I can determine an author’s point of view and purpose in *Trash Vortex*.”

“I can analyze how the author of *Trash Vortex* distinguishes her position from that of others.”

- Direct students to independently read pages 44–49 of ***Trash Vortex***, using the **Text Guide: *Trash Vortex*** **(for teacher reference**) as necessary. If students do not finish reading the excerpt within the allotted time, use the **Synopsis: *Trash Vortex***, **Pages 44–49** document to review the key details from the excerpt. Then have students identify the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary and reflect on their reading as they choose, using the following resources as appropriate: **vocabulary logs** and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Once students have finished reading and reflecting on the excerpt, ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What habits of character did you see in this excerpt? Who demonstrated them? What did they look/sound like?” (Possible response: the scientists and experts interviewed demonstrate contributing to a better world by applying their learning to help the environment.)

- Distribute the **Author’s Point of View and Purpose: *Trash Vortex***, **Chapter 4 note-catcher** and the **Author’s Point of View and Purpose: *Trash Vortex***, **Chapter 4 note-catcher** ▲ as necessary. The differentiated note-catcher supports students’ comprehension and writing with sentence starters. ▲ Ask students to record the gist of the excerpt and the central ideas and their development. If students need support, ask them to Think-Pair-Share:

“What is the gist of this excerpt?” (There are many solutions for solving plastic pollution problem.) As necessary, consult the Gists: *Trash Vortex* (example for teacher reference) document.

“What are the central ideas in this excerpt?” (One main way to reduce plastic pollution is to figure out how to get plastic to biodegrade. Another way to reduce plastic pollution is by reusing and recycling.) If students have trouble identifying the central ideas, ask: “What main kinds of solutions does the author share in this excerpt?” ▲

“What are some of the ways the author develops the central ideas in this excerpt?” If students have trouble identifying the details, ask: “What important details, facts, or examples does the author use to tell us about the main solutions for reducing plastic pollution?” (The author explains how scientists study plastic-eating organisms and are creating new kinds of biodegradable plastic. The author tells the story of *Plastiki*, the “bottle craft,” and quotes from experts about reusing and recycling.)▲

- Allow several minutes for students to independently grapple with identifying the author’s overall point of view and purpose as well as the other points of view she includes in the text. Students should record their initial ideas on their note-catchers. Then review students’ responses by asking them to Think-Pair-Share:

“What is the author’s overall point of view and purpose in this excerpt? Why does she discuss so many solutions to the plastic pollution problem? Does she favor one solution over another?” (Her overall purpose and position is to explain that there are many different solutions to the plastic pollution problem. She doesn’t seem to favor one over another.)

“What different perspectives does she include in this excerpt? How does she distinguish each perspective from the others?” (She includes scientists’ perspectives that biodegradable plastic is a good solution. She quotes the scientists and explains the process. Then she quotes other scientists and environmentalists who directly disagree with the biodegradable plastic. She quotes them explaining how recycling and reusing plastic is a better solution.)

- For additional answers, consult the **Author’s Point of View and Purpose: *Trash Vortex***, **Chapter 4 note-catcher (example for teacher reference)**.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- For Work Time A, explain to students that completing the analysis and note-catcher independently will prepare them for doing so on their assessment in the following lesson. Remind students that they have completed similar analysis and note-catchers throughout the unit and are prepared for this challenge.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time A, assess whether students need the support of the Author’s Point of View and Purpose: *Trash Vortex*, Chapter 4 note-catcher ▲. This resource features sentence starters that support students with comprehension and writing. If students can forgo using this support, they will grow in independence and achievement for similar analysis tasks on assessments.

Closing and Assessment

A. Collaborative Discussion: Author’s Point of View and Purpose – RI.7.6 (10 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can determine an author’s point of view and purpose in *Trash Vortex*.”

- Direct students to form the predetermined groups for discussion. Remind students to show respect, empathy, and compassion as they follow the classroom rules for collegial discussion. They will also take initiative as they participate in a discussion. Refer to the Work to Become Ethical People and **Work to Become Effective Learners** anchor charts as necessary to review the habits of character.

- Remind students to use the following materials during their discussion:

- Author’s Point of View and Purpose: *Trash Vortex*, Chapter 4 note-catcher

- *Trash Vortex*

- **Discussion Norms anchor chart**

- **Quote Accurately from the Text**

- If silent discussion is preferable, direct students to record their responses to the questions on a piece of paper and pass that paper to another student in the group, adding ideas each time the paper is passed. Use the questions below for further silent discussion. ▲

- Invite students to begin the discussion by responding to the following prompts and drawing on their responses in the Author’s Point of View and Purpose: *Trash Vortex*, Chapter 4 note-catcher for evidence to support their responses:

“What is Danielle Smith-Llera’s purpose in pages 44–49 of? How can you tell? What is her overall point of view?” Trash Vortex(For more examples, see the Author’s Point of View and Purpose: *Trash Vortex*, Chapter 4 note-catcher.)

- Circulate as students discuss to ensure they are using evidence to support their responses. As necessary, prompt further discussion by asking:

“Are there other examples of the author’s purpose in these pages? What other points of view does she include? How does she distinguish their points of view from each other?” ▲

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- In Closing and Assessment A, ensure that students are strategically grouped to best support them. This may mean mixed groupings by language or content proficiency. However, since groups include about four students, ensure that there are two students from each level and no more than one level of difference among the students in a group. Strategic grouping affords students the opportunity of supporting and being challenged by others.

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from the anchor text *Trash Vortex.* Provide ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Invite students to predict some of the questions that the Language Dive may ask. This will improve students’ metacognition and challenge their awareness of the most interesting or meaningful elements of the sentence.

For Heavier Support

- As in the lighter support, for Closing and Assessment A, ensure that students are strategically grouped to best support them. In addition to the lighter supports, consider grouping students who need heavier support by home language.

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from the anchor text *Trash Vortex*. Provide ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Encourage students to independently reflect on this sentence and its meaning before the next lesson. Students may also wish to use dictionaries to add any unknown vocabulary and meanings to their **vocabulary logs**.

Homework

A. Analyze Point of View and Purpose

- Students complete **Homework: Analyze Point of View and Purpose: *Trash Vortex***, **Pages 44–49** by answering questions about the author’s point of view and purpose, and how she distinguishes her position from others in *Trash Vortex*.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.

For Lighter Support

- Consider whether students still need to work with the **Synopsis: Trash Vortex, Pages 44–49** or whether they are ready to be released into prereading the text without this support. Some students may still need this support for the prereading outside of class. Some may want to quickly skim the synopsis just before reading in class, and some may be ready to forgo this support altogether. This gradual release may happen on a student-by-student basis and may occur as the result of students’ self-assessment.

- Also, challenge students to continue their work from the Language Dive in Lesson 7 by writing their homework constructed response with at least <u>three</u> different types of sentences.

For Heavier Support

- Provide students with the Synopsis: *Trash Vortex*, Pages 44–49, <u>and ask them to highlight the key individuals, events, and ideas in the text once they have completed their prereading</u>. (Underline indicates how the support is being modified to gradually release students to more independence.) Then they can take note or make sketches in the margins of the synopsis to convey the gist of each section. Doing so <u>after</u> reading is a gradual release from the support they used up to this point but will still confirm their comprehension of the complex text.

- Also, as in the lighter support, challenge students to continue their work from the Language Dive in Lesson 7 by writing their homework constructed response with at least two different types of sentences.
