**Directions:** As you enter class, respond to the following prompts.

Today you will experience the Close Viewing protocol with the cover photo to *Trash Vortex*. Zoom in on one part of the image. Look closely at the details in that part of the image. Record what you noticed and what you inferred.

1.  Draw or write about the details that you noticed.

Answers will vary, but may include: The seal’s mouth is open, with a big pink tongue and tiny teeth. The seal’s whiskers point straight up. The seal’s eyes are looking skyward.

2.  What can you learn or infer from those details?

Answers will vary, but may include: The seal’s mouth is open, which could mean that it is barking, as seals do, or that it is in pain. When you really study the seal’s eyes, the animal looks worried.
