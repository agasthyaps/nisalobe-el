<td colspan="3"><p>How the Author Distinguishes Her Point of View from Others:</p>
<p>The author’s point of view is that <strong>there are many different ways to solve the plastic pollution problem.</strong> She presents the points of view of <strong>several experts, all of whom have a distinct point of view on the best way to solve the problem.</strong> She distinguishes one point of view from another by <strong>showing how some experts think organisms can eat plastic or plastic can be made to biodegrade.</strong> Other experts argue that <strong>reusing and recycling plastic is the best way to solve the problem.</strong> The author distinguishes these points of view by <strong>quoting different experts and giving different examples.</strong> Showing different methods for solving the problem supports her own position that <strong>there are many ways to solve the problem.</strong></p></td>
