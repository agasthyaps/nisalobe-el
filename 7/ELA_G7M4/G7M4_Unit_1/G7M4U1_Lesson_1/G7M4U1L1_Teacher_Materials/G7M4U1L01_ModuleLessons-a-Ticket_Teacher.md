(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, respond to the following prompts.

Today you will embark on a scavenger hunt with a partner or small group of classmates.

1.  What do you think a scavenger hunt is? (Hint: use your knowledge of the words **scavenger** and **hunt** to figure it out.)

Responses will vary, but may include: A hunt for answers.

2.  What do you think you will do during this activity?

Responses will vary, but may include: Work as a group or a partnership to find the answers to questions.

3.  The terms **single-use plastic** and **plankton** will become important during this activity. What do you think the phrase **single-use plastic** and the word **plankton** mean?

“Single-use plastic” means plastic that is used only once and then thrown away. Plankton are a mixture of very small plants and animals floating in fresh or saltwater. Most kinds of plankton are microscopic. Plankton is an important food source for many animals that live in water.

4.  What norms and character traits do you think you need to keep in mind as you work with your group to complete the scavenger hunt?

Responses will vary, but may include: We need to

• stay together as a group and work collaboratively, respectfully, and with initiative and responsibility;

• “share the air” when deciding what to do and where to go next;

• make sure we hear from all voices in the group;

• take turns writing down our answers;

• share leadership tasks and responsibilities; and

• use technology safely and responsibly.
