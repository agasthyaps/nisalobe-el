English Language Learners: Grade 7: Module 4: Unit 1: Teaching Notes

Building Background Knowledge: What Is Plastic Pollution?

Teaching Notes for Unit 1

Prioritize Lessons for Classrooms with Many English Language Learners

To prepare for the mid-unit assessment, prioritize and expand instruction in Lessons 2–6, which guide students to analyze the filmmaking techniques and arguments in the documentary film *A Plastic Ocean*. Students will engage in similar analysis on the mid-unit assessment. ELLs, especially, may need support articulating the effect of the filmmaking techniques on developing meaning. The lessons and this guide incorporate modeling, peer-supported practice, and sentence frames to help ELLs identify and articulate the effects of film techniques. ELLs may also need support identifying the claims and evidence, especially in a fast-paced visual and oral medium such as a documentary film. The lessons and this guide provide the film transcript before and after students analyze the film to support students with and incorporate a gradual release.

To prepare for the end of unit assessment, prioritize instruction in Lessons 8–11, during which students analyze the anchor text *Trash Vortex* by Danielle Smith-Llera for the author’s point of view and purpose. ELLs may especially need support identifying and distinguishing different points of view. The lessons and this guide incorporate modeling, peer-supported practice, and differentiated note-catchers to help ELLs identify and distinguish authors’ points of view.

Language Dives

In Lessons 7 and 12–13, students participate in Language Dives on sentences from the film and anchor text. In Lesson 7, students analyze the speaker’s evidence and sentence type in a sentence from the documentary film *A Plastic Ocean*. In Lessons 12–13, students examine the author’s point of view and figurative language in a sentence from the anchor text *Trash Vortex*.

Module 4 Language Dives continue to follow a modified process introduced in Module 3. This process allows students to take more of the lead in the conversation and build greater independence by taking an inquiry-based approach to language in general, and the selected sentence in particular. The new format invites them to slow down during one chunk, called the focus structure, to investigate and practice a particularly compelling language structure.

Most Language Dives implicitly address a wide range of Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening, and Language standards. Once comfortable with Language Dives, supplement the focus standards in a particular Language Dive with additional standards to meet students’ needs. Note that the Rationale section of each Language Dive also identifies supporting standards that are explicitly addressed but are not the main focus of the Language Dive.

Language Chunk Wall

Continue to develop a “Language Chunk Wall” to extend students’ capacity to use Language Dive structures. The Language Chunk Wall, first introduced in Module 2, is an area in the classroom where students can display and categorize the academic phrases discussed in each Language Dive. At the end of each Language Dive, students are invited to place the Language Dive sentence chunk strips on the Language Chunk Wall into corresponding categories, such as “Nouns and Noun Phrases” or “Linking Language.” See each Language Dive for suggested categories. Color-code each category for additional support, such as blue for nouns and subjects; purple for pronouns; red for predicates and verbs; yellow for adjectives; and green for adverbs, prepositions, and conjunctions. Students can then refer to the wall during subsequent speaking and writing tasks.

Mini Language Dives

Students have an opportunity to participate in Mini Language Dives beginning in Module 2, Unit 1. Mini Language Dives have the same overall purpose and follow the same general process as full Language Dives, but are condensed to 5 minutes, narrowing students’ attention on deconstructing the focus structure, reconstructing the sentence, and practicing the focus structure. Mini Language Dives give ELLs additional support in building language and literacy skills, as well as habits of mind. Mini Language Dives are optional and can be found in the corresponding lessons within this guide. In this unit, optional Mini Language Dives appear in Lessons 3 and 5.

Diversity and Inclusion

Be mindful of ELLs’ formal schooling experiences, degree of home- and English-language development, length of time in the United States and in its schools, and family backgrounds. These variables impact the ways in which students will progress in their English language acquisition across speaking, listening, reading, and writing. Depending on their background, ELLs may often have strong oral proficiency in their home language with less proficiency in reading and writing. Likewise, ELLs’ oral English language proficiency may be more highly developed than their abilities in comprehending and producing written language. In light of this, be mindful of when ELLs are struggling with content and when they are struggling with the skill-specific proficiency needed to understand what they read or to express concepts in writing. Use multimodal input on topics simultaneously (e.g., read-alouds, English language subtitles on videos) to help students begin to align their proficiency in receptive skills (listening or reading) and in their productive skills (speaking or writing). Provide continued opportunities for students to express their understanding of topics orally.

Look for ways to provide opportunities to draw on and incorporate students’ home languages into their learning. Support ELLs in strategically using their home language in the classroom to enrich their engagement with tasks and to deepen their understanding of content and concepts. Encourage students to engage in discussions in home language groups, to reflect in writing in their home language, and to make connections between linguistic features of the English language and their home language. For content-based tasks, when possible, provide translated texts and audio-visual materials to help ELLs gain access to topics in their home language. Investigate the routines, practices, rituals, beliefs, norms, and experiences that are important to ELLs and their families. Integrate this background into the classroom as students engage with texts. Consider the values and narratives embedded in class texts and try to anticipate their relevance to ELLs. Foster inclusive action by creating space for students to express their feelings about sensitive issues or content, knowing that these discussions may help create equity, amplify student voices, or unearth trauma. Consult with a guidance counselor, school social worker, or ESL teacher for further investigation of diversity and inclusion.

Conversation Cues

Encourage productive and equitable conversation with Conversation Cues, which are questions to ask students that help achieve four goals:

- (Goal 1) encourage all students to talk and be understood;

- (Goal 2) listen carefully to one another and seek to understand;

- (Goal 3) deepen thinking; and

- (Goal 4) think with others to expand the conversation (adapted from Michaels, Sarah and O’Connor, Cathy. *Talk Science Primer*. Cambridge, MA: TERC, 2012. http://inquiryproject.terc.edu/shared/pd/TalkScience_Primer.pdf. Based on Chapin, S., O’Connor, C., and Anderson, N. \[2009\]. *Classroom Discussions: Using Math Talk to Help Students Learn, Grades K–6*. Second Edition. Sausalito, CA: Math Solutions Publications).

Refer to the Tools Page (http://eled.org/tools) for the complete set of cues. Goal 1 Conversation Cues were introduced in Module 1, Unit 1; Goal 2 Conversation Cues were introduced in Module 1, Unit 3; and Goal 3 Conversation Cues were introduced in Module 2, Unit 2. All will continue to be used throughout this module. Goal 4 Conversation Cues are introduced in Lesson 1 and suggestions for integrating Conversation Cues into instruction are presented across lessons. For ELLs, Conversation Cues are especially critical because they improve language processing abilities and increase engagement and participation.

Use Conversation Cues as often as possible to gradually release thinking and expression of ideas to students; avoid using Conversation Cues as a way of searching for the “right” answer. Students often struggle to create productive and equitable conversation during Turn and Talk or Think-Pair-Share protocols; Conversation Cues can make the difference. Recall that the main goals of Conversation Cues are supporting students to express their ideas (Goal 1), listen to other students’ ideas (Goal 2), deepen their own ideas (Goal 3), and build on other students’ ideas (Goal 4).

Consider this model transcription from a classroom where about 85% of students are ELLs. Support students to build their ideas about the choice an author made when writing this sentence about an athlete’s factors for success: **There were many factors that led to Rickey’s success, but it was support from others in baseball that was most important**. Students can carry the Conversation Cues into small groups to support their own independent productive and equitable conversations.

Mr. Valencia: What if I replace **but** with **and**? **And** is also a conjunction. How would **and** change the meaning? I'll give you some time to think. Emma, you want to give it a shot?

Emma: It is adding on to the, like, the idea, of the first (part of the) sentence?

Mr. Valencia: Can anyone repeat or rephrase what Emma just said?

Santiago: It would have the same idea as the first two chunks.

Mr. Valencia: Right, **and** would have the same idea as the first two chunks. Two connecting, same ideas. So how does **but** change that for me? Jazmin?

Jazmin: **But** would change it.

Mr. Valencia: Can you say more about that, Jazmin?

Jazmin: It would change it because but would say there are many things happening, but this is the one.

Mr. Valencia: So does anyone want to add something else to that?

Daniel: **But** is saying this is the main thing happening.

Mr. Valencia: Right, now the sentence is going to the main factor (for success), or a contrast. **But** is something that is going to tell us a contrast. (Exchange continues.)

Strategic Grouping

Students work in pairs and small groups to complete various tasks throughout the unit. While reading in class, students can read independently, in pairs or small groups, or as a full class. In earlier lessons, as students begin the anchor text, match ELLs with a partner who has greater language proficiency. The conversations and reading support that occur as a result of such strategic pairing will greatly serve the language development of both partners. In later lessons, cultivate ELLs’ autonomy and flexibility by encouraging them to vary their reading habits.

Differentiated Materials

Differentiated materials, including entrance tickets and note-catchers, are available for ELLs and other students who would benefit from an increased level of support. These resources have been modified for the purposes of creating accessibility to content and concepts and supporting language development. Depending upon the task being carried out, images, selected response options, answer banks, sentence frames, or model responses have been embedded to guide students’ thinking without compromising a focus on standards and the skills that students are developing and applying to meet them.

Celebration

Celebrate the courage, enthusiasm, diversity, and bilingual assets that ELLs bring to the classroom. Additionally, students can celebrate their successful attempts at communication and their ability to extend and enhance the discussions.
