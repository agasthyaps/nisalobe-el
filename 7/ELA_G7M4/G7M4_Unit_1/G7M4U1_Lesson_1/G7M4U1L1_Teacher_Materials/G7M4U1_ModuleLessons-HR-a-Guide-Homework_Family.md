Where and how does plastic pollute?

- *Plastic pollutes our world (especially our oceans) when people dispose of it incorrectly.*

- *Plastic pollution travels from land to the ocean and is taken by the currents in a big vortex called the North Pacific Gyre.*

- *Animals and people are being harmed by plastic pollution.*

- *Plastic entered our world in the 1950s, and, through marketing and lifestyle, has become ubiquitous.*

What can be done about plastic pollution? What is being done? What can I do?

- *There are three main points in the life cycle of plastic: the beginning (making plastic), the middle (buying and using plastic), and the end (disposing of plastic).*

- *People try to combat plastic pollution with different solutions at these three points in the plastic life cycle.*

- *People who combat plastic pollution use their skills and learning to help others and to improve their environment and our world.*

What will your student be doing at school?

In Lesson 1, students explore the topic of plastic pollution through a scavenger hunt throughout the school (or classroom), in which they document the kind of material they see in the garbage, recycling, and around their environment. In the same lesson, students begin studying the documentary *A Plastic Ocean*[^1]. In each lesson throughout the first half of the unit, students view a film clip as a class several times. Then they work collaboratively to complete note-catchers and engage in discussions.

For the first few lessons, students compare and contrast the film *A Plastic Ocean* to its transcript to analyze the different portrayals of plastic pollution. For example, students examine how the film’s images clarify and emphasize the points written in the transcript. Students also analyze the film’s main ideas and supporting details, as well as how the ideas in the video clarify the issue of plastic pollution. For instance, a central idea of the film is that plastic pollution is harmful to animals. They develop this central idea through expert interviews, images, and statistics. In the last third of the film, students identify and analyze the speakers’ arguments by evaluating their claims as well as the soundness of their reasoning and the relevance and sufficiency of their evidence. For example, one claim a speaker makes is that governments can do more to reduce plastic by banning it. The speakers in the film use relevant and sufficient evidence by explaining how many local, state, and even federal governments have banned plastic items. Students complete the mid-unit assessment, in which they watch a clip of *A Plastic Ocean* and answer selected and constructed response questions to demonstrate their ability to identify main ideas and supporting details, compare the portrayal of a subject in the film and transcript, and evaluate the speakers’ arguments.

In the second half of Unit 1, students address big ideas about where and how plastic pollutes, as well as what can be done about plastic pollution. Students read the anchor text *Trash Vortex* by Danielle Smith-Llera, a complex informational text filled with images and diagrams about plastic pollution. As they read this text throughout the unit, students identify central ideas and supporting details. For example, a central idea of the text is that plastic can be harmful to people. The author supports this idea by explaining how plastic in the ocean gets broken down into tiny pieces that marine animals eat. Then humans eat the fish and the plastic, which can make them sick. Students also analyze the text for author’s purpose such as how the author writes narrative nonfiction stories to engage the reader and gives examples and statistics to inform the reader. Students also learn to analyze the text for how the author distinguishes her position from that of others. For example, the author contrasts her point of view that plastic is dangerous for the environment with the point of view of people from the 1950s and 1960s who didn’t know the dangers of plastic and thought it was only convenient and disposable. During the end of unit assessment, students read and analyze the end of *Trash Vortex*, answering selected and constructed response questions to analyze central ideas as well as the author’s purpose and how she distinguishes her position from others.

Central to the EL Education curriculum is a focus on “habits of character” and social-emotional learning. Students work to become effective learners, developing mindsets and skills for success in college, career, and life (e.g., initiative, responsibility, perseverance, collaboration); work to become ethical people, treating others well and standing up for what is right (e.g., empathy, integrity, respect, compassion); and work to contribute to a better world, putting their learning to use to improve communities (e.g., citizenship, service).

In this unit, students focus on working to become effective learners as they persevere to analyze arguments in a documentary and the author’s purpose and point of view in complex texts. Students also take responsibility and initiative as they collaborate during in-class discussions and in group analysis work. Students focus on working to become ethical people by showing empathy and compassion for the people and animals threatened by pollution. As they explore the anchor texts *A Plastic Ocean* and *Trash Vortex*, students witness the habits of character that are exhibited by the filmmakers, experts, scientists, and author as they contribute to making the world a better place in numerous ways. The various people filmed in *A Plastic Ocean* model contributing to a better world as they inform the public about the problem of plastic pollution, inspire environmental action, share their knowledge, and work to pass laws or create inventions to reduce plastic pollution in order to improve their shared spaces and environment. The scientists and volunteers in *A Plastic Ocean* demonstrate other habits of character, such as taking initiative in studying the plastic in the ocean, collaborating with each other to try and improve the oceans, and persevering through cleanup efforts.

How can you support your student at home?

Notice plastic waste in your home and plastic pollution in your neighborhood. Visit local waterways and/or storm drains to find signs of plastic pollution.

Explore with your student issues around plastic pollution. Read articles, nonfiction texts, and watch documentary films related to plastic pollution at various points during the plastic life cycle:

- Beginning: Finding alternatives to plastic

- Middle: Recycling or reusing plastic

- End: Cleaning up plastic pollution

Watch documentary films, and discuss the following techniques:

- Images: still pictures shown on the screen

- Camera techniques: what the film shows and how the film shows it

- Music: mood that the music creates

- Voice-overs: what people off screen say

- Interviews: discussions between two or more people in which one asks questions and the other(s) answers

- Graphics: diagrams or other created images that explain information

- Statistics: pieces of data or facts

- Text: words printed on the screen

You may use questions such as the following for your conversations:

- How do the techniques (images, camera techniques, voice-overs, interviews, graphics, statistics, and text) in documentary films add to the impact of storytelling and develop claims?

- What are the central ideas in the text or documentary film?

- What is the speaker’s argument and claims in the documentary film? Does the speaker use relevant and sufficient evidence and sound reasoning?

- What is the author’s purpose and how is it developed?

- What is the author’s point of view in the text? How does the author distinguish his or her position from that of others?

- What do you think should be done about the problem of plastic pollution?

- How can we help with the problem of plastic pollution in our own home, neighborhood, or community?

Unit 1: Homework

In Lesson 1, students read the module guiding questions (listed above) and discuss them with a family member, talking about how the questions make them feel and why, and what the questions make them think about. Students can sketch or write their reflections.

In Lessons 2–5, and 7 students write a brief paragraph to reflect on what they have seen of the documentary *A Plastic Ocean* so far, including questions they have.

In Lesson 5, students read excerpts of the film transcript they will study in the following lesson and reflect on the text. After that they complete the Homework: Correctly Place Modifying Phrases by creating phrases without dangling modifiers.

In Lessons 8–10, students preread a chapter of *Trash Vortex* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson. Students also use context and, if necessary, a dictionary to determine the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary in the chapter. Then they record the words and their definitions in the correct section of their vocabulary log.

In Lessons 10–11, students answer selected and constructed response questions about central ideas, author’s purpose, and point of view in *Trash Vortex*.

In Lessons 6–7 and 11–13, students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their independent reading journal.

Research Reading: When not reading the anchor text, your student is expected to independently research the topic by reading topic-related books of his or her choice for approximately 20 minutes each day and responding to a prompt of choice in the front of the independent reading journal. These are usually books your student will bring home from school; however, they may be topic-related books chosen by the student at the public or your home library. Prompts for independent reading can be found in the homework materials provided below.

Independent Reading

**Directions:** Remember to record responses to research reading in the front of your independent reading journal and responses to choice reading in the back. Try to choose a different prompt each time. Record any new vocabulary in your vocabulary log. Underline vocabulary found during independent reading.

**Record:**

- Date

- Title and author of your reading book

- Pages you have read

- Prompt

- Response

**Example:**

<u>Date:</u> 03/01/19

<u>Book Title and Author:</u> *Trash Vortex* by Danielle Smith-Llera

<u>Pages Read:</u> 26–37

<u>Prompt:</u> What is the author’s point of view in the text? How does the author distinguish his or her position from that of others?

<u>Response:</u> The author’s point of view is that plastic is a huge problem. In this chapter, she distinguishes her own point of view from the point of view of most Americans in the 1950s and 1960s, which was that plastic is useful, beneficial, and disposable.

**  
Consider using the following independent reading prompts.**[^2]

- What are the central ideas in the text and how are they developed?

- What is the author’s purpose and how is it developed?

- What is the author’s point of view in the text? How does the author distinguish his or her position from that of others?

- Where and how does plastic pollute?

- What can be done about plastic pollution? What is being done about plastic pollution?

- Choose one new word from your reading today and analyze it on a vocabulary square.

| **Definition in your own words**                  | **Synonyms** (words with the same meaning) |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Words with the same affix or root**             | **Sketch**                                 |
| **Translation in home language** (if appropriate) |                                            |

Vocabulary

**Directions:** In the classroom, you have been recording words from your texts in your vocabulary log. Throughout this unit, you have been research reading topic-related books at home to build your knowledge of plastic pollution and recording words in your independent reading journal.

Choose a word from your research reading or from a text you’ve read in class and add the word to your vocabulary log. Try to choose a different word to add and to practice a different vocabulary strategy each time. For each word, be sure to add the following:

1.  The definition, or meaning, of the word

<!-- -->

3.  The vocabulary strategy you used to figure out the meaning of the word

4.  A sketch or diagram that helps you to better understand the meaning of the word

Record new vocabulary in vocabulary logs and mark academic vocabulary with a symbol, for example, a star:

- Academic vocabulary: words you might find in informational texts on many different topics. For example, the words **evidence** and **rationale** are words that could be found in books on any topic.

- Domain-specific vocabulary: words about a particular topic. For example, the words **tadpoles**, **frogspawn**, and **amphibian** are some that would be found on the topic of frogs.

**Vocabulary Strategies**

As a reminder, the vocabulary strategies we’ve been working on in class are listed below:

- Context: Read the sentence around the word.

- Look at the affixes for clues.

- Look at the root of the word for clues.

- Use a dictionary.

- Discuss the word with another person (after attempting some of the above strategies).

[^1]: Students will not view the entire documentary; rather, they will examine select scenes of the film to support their content understanding and address literacy standards.

[^2]: Some of the prompts will not be appropriate for the text students are reading. Invite students to choose a prompt that works for the text they have just read.
