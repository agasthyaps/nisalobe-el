Directions for Scavenger Hunt: School Version

**Name:** **Date:**

1.  Take your tool kit, map of the school, a pencil, and a device with you. Begin by choosing a task card or information card. Choose a different card if a group is already there.

2.  Look carefully at the task card or information card. Record your answer on the note-catcher, take a photograph or a video as directed on the card. Post your photograph or video to the teacher-provided link immediately, so you don’t forget.

3.  Take turns recording your answers on the note-catcher. Stay together as a group, and listen to your teammates as you work collaboratively on tasks.

4.  Continue working through the scavenger hunt until the time is up. Be sure to return to class at the specified time.
