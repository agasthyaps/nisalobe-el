RI.7.10

**Name:** **Date:**

- Charles Moore sailed his boat, *Alguiita*, from California to Hawaii in 1997. The boat entered the North Pacific Ocean gyre, a whirlpool.

- He saw lots of pieces of plastic in the mid-Pacific.

- There are eleven gyres in the world’s oceans. They move seawater and everything floating in it.

- The gyres create plastic bits of trash by breaking plastic apart.

- The gyres add more and more bits of plastic to the whirlpool.

- Researchers collect the microplastics and create maps of where it is floating.

- Moore created the Algalita Marine Research Foundation to help clean up the ocean.

- He discovered microplastic everywhere in the gyre. It is now named the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. It is twice the size of Texas.
