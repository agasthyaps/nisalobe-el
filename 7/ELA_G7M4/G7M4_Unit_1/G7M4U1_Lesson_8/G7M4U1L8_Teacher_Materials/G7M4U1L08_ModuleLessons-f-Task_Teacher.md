Gists: *Trash Vortex*

(Example for Teacher Reference)

This is a list of sample gists for each large section of *Trash Vortex*. Students record these overall gists on sticky notes, including the chapter number and their initials, to ensure the notes are returned to their original order or owner. Students will also record gists of specific subsections on note-catchers throughout the unit. Knowing the gist of specific subsections will help students identify text structures, analyze how the subsection relates to the whole section or chapter, and analyze how events, individuals, and ideas interact.
