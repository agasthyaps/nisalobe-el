CRAIG: Six containers full of nurdles. All of them broke up in the storm and disgorged most of their plastic bags into the sea. The vast majority broke open, and the contents spilled out. Run them through your fingers there.

TRACEY: Just plastic pellets everywhere. It looked like snow on the beach.

CRAIG: On the neighboring Lamma Island, they found tons of this stuff that had come ashore. It seems the company that made the nurdles has unwittingly put their signature on them—Sinopec, a giant Chinese oil company that makes nurdles for distribution worldwide. (37:18–38:11)
