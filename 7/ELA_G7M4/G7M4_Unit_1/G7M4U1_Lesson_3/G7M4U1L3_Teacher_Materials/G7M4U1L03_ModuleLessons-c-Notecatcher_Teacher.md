<p>TRANSCRIPT: Looking out over the vast expanse of clear, sparkling water, there is no plastic in sight. (indistinct chatter) The contents of the trawl are emptied and floated. The tiny pieces of plastic then reveal themselves to Jo and Dr. Neal. (27:04–27:23)</p>
<p>How do the techniques in the video add to the meaning of the transcript and help develop ideas?</p>
<p>The video starts off by showing <strong>an image of the ocean to demonstrate what the narrator means by “the vast expanse of clear, sparkling water.”</strong> At first, the image shows<strong>, no plastic is visible.</strong> But then, as the narrator discusses <strong>the “contents of the trawl,” the camera reveals images of the tiny plastic.</strong> These techniques help show the idea that <strong>plastic isn’t always visible in the ocean but exists in vast amounts.</strong></p></td>

**Part II**

**Directions:** Read the excerpts from the transcript below along with the video to answer the questions.

1.  Read the following excerpt from the transcript and answer the questions that follow.

Our oceans are driven by five major circular currents, or **gyres**. These are created by the Earth’s rotation and the resulting predominant winds.

**Part A**

Which of the following phrases is a synonym for **gyres** in the transcript? (L.7.4)

2.  “our oceans”

3.  “Earth’s rotation”

4.  <u>“circular currents”</u>

5.  “predominant winds”

**Part B**

How does the video of this excerpt help explain how **gyres** is defined in the transcript? (RI.7.7)

1.  by using text to talk about the details

2.  <u>by showing their movements in graphics</u>

3.  by featuring an interview with an expert

4.  by showing images of plastic in the ocean

<!-- -->

1.  Read the following excerpt from the transcript and answer the questions that follow.

TANYA: Scientists estimate that there are more than five trillion pieces of plastic afloat in our oceans worldwide.

CRAIG: There is no floating island of plastic. What exists is far more **insidious**. What exists is a kind of plastic smog. These tiny pieces of plastic that are floating on the surface of the ocean come from larger pieces. Over time, the sun’s ultraviolet light, ocean wave action, and salt break it up into smaller pieces called microplastics. Microplastics have rough, pitted surfaces. Waterborne chemicals from industry and agriculture stick to microplastics, making them toxic poison pills. (27:27–28:14)

**Part A**

What does the narrator mean that the “tiny pieces of plastic” are far more **insidious** than a “floating island of plastic”? (L.7.4)

1.  They are not a major concern.

2.  They are not known by most scientists.

3.  They are less harmful and more obvious.

4.  <u>They are more dangerous and less obvious.</u>

**Part B**

How does the video help to explain why the “tiny pieces of plastic” are insidious? (RI.7.7)

1.  The text suggests that scientists do not know how much plastic there is.

<!-- -->

5.  The voiceover questions people’s belief about whether plastics are harmful.

6.  <u>The images and graphics show how the plastics become small and dangerous.</u>

7.  The images of wildlife show them surviving despite being surrounded by plastic.
