5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

SL.7.1, SL.7.2, L.7.1a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

Scientists estimate **that there are more than five trillion pieces of plastic afloat in our oceans worldwide.** (from *A Plastic Ocean*, 25:48–28:56)

**Lesson 3 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after watching and analyzing the video in Work Time A.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students address the daily learning target (**I can identify the main ideas in a clip of *A Plastic Ocean* and explain how they are conveyed**) and SL.7.2 by clearly presenting one of the central ideas of the documentary. This sentence also helps students address L.7.1a by featuring a noun clause that functions as a direct object of the verb **estimate**. Supporting standards: SL.7.1.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it includes a noun clause that functions as a direct object and contains the most critical information in the sentence.

- Transfer: Students use noun clauses to attribute information to particular groups (e.g., scientists) as they write about the main ideas of other excerpts in the documentary.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **Scientists estimate <u>that there are more than five trillion pieces of plastic afloat in our oceans worldwide</u>.**

- Ask:

“What is this sentence about?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **that there are more than five trillion pieces of plastic afloat in our oceans worldwide.**

- Ask:

“What do you notice about this chunk?” (Responses will vary, but may include: This chunk begins with that and tells the reader precisely how much plastic there is in the ocean.)

“How would we write the number five trillion?” (Five trillion is written as a 5 followed by twelve zeros.)

- For comparison, or to help students determine how many zeroes are in a trillion, remind students that a million is written with six zeros and a billion is written with nine zeros.

“How does it make you feel to imagine so much plastic in the oceans of the world?” (Responses will vary.)

- If productive, invite students to close their eyes and visualize that much plastic floating in the oceans before sharing their ideas with a partner.

“How does this quantity of plastic relate to the title of the documentary, A Plastic Ocean?” (Responses will vary, but may include: Five trillion pieces of plastic is a lot. If we imagine that much plastic in the world’s oceans, they start to seem as if they are made of plastic. This image of oceans made of plastic is also what the documentary title suggests.)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **Scientists estimate <u>that there are more than five trillion pieces of plastic afloat in our oceans worldwide</u>.**

- Ask:

“How does the meaning of the sentence change when the first chunk, Scientists estimate, is added to the sentence?” (The first chunk tells us both who knows this information and the extent to which they know it.)

“What does the word estimate suggest about what scientists know about the ocean?” (The word estimate suggests that the exact number might be difficult for scientists to know. Instead, they are using their research and expertise to make an educated guess.)

- Draw students’ attention again to the focus structure of the sentence: **that there are more than five trillion pieces of plastic afloat in our oceans worldwide.**

“What kind of clause is this and what is its grammatical function in the sentence? How do you know?” (This is a noun clause and it is functioning as the direct object in the sentence. It is “receiving” the action of the verb estimates.)

- Provide students with other nouns and noun phrases that could replace this chunk in the sentence to better enable them to see its function as a noun and direct object (e.g., **Scientists estimate <u>the answer</u>**).

“How can you use noun clauses like this in your own writing?” (Responses will vary, but may include: I can use noun clauses like this to summarize what is said or estimated by experts in this field.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target  
I can identify the main ideas in a clip of A Plastic Ocean and explain how they are conveyed?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

> **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**
>
> group verb noun clause beginning with **that**
>
> (subject + verb + direct object)

- Say:

“Use this frame to connect a relevant group of people (like scientists, environmentalists, or documentary filmmakers) to an important piece of information about plastic pollution. Select an appropriate verb (e.g., feel, believe, suggest, point out) to show the connection between the group and the information.”

- Possible student answers:

> **<u>Environmentalists believe that plastic pollution in the ocean is a tremendous and complicated problem.</u>**
