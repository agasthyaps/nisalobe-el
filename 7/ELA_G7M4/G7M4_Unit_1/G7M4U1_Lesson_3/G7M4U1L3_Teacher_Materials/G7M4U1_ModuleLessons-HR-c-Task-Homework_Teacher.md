Homework: Reflect on Film  
and Transcript: Lesson 3

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Respond in writing to the following prompts.

1.  In the space below, write a brief paragraph reflecting on what you have seen of the documentary *A Plastic Ocean* so far, including questions you have.

Answers will vary but may include: So far, we have seen how much plastic is produced and thrown away every day and how this affects animals in the ocean, such as whales. Today we saw video of what looked like clear ocean, but it turned out to be water filled with tiny pieces of plastic. The plastic wasn’t visible until the people on the boat caught it in a net. This was really interesting and upsetting because it means that the problem is even worse than it appears at first.

One question I have is: Can we clean up this tiny plastic without also catching fish and other ocean life?

2.  Read the following excerpt of the film transcript that you will study in the following lesson. Then respond in writing to the prompts that follow.

CRAIG: Six containers full of nurdles. All of them broke up in the storm and disgorged most of their plastic bags into the sea. The vast majority broke open, and the contents spilled out. Run them through your fingers there.

TRACEY: Just plastic pellets everywhere. It looked like snow on the beach.

CRAIG: On the neighboring Lamma Island, they found tons of this stuff that had come ashore. It seems the company that made the nurdles has unwittingly put their signature on them—Sinopec, a giant Chinese oil company that makes nurdles for distribution worldwide. (37:18–38:11)

**Part A**

What is the gist of this excerpt?

Six containers of nurdles, tiny plastic pellets from a Chinese company, fell into the ocean in a storm.

**Part B**

What thoughts or questions do you have about it?

Answers will vary but may include: It is overwhelming and troubling to read and think about how much plastic ends up in the ocean. Some of these nurdles washed up on beaches. But some of it must have sunk into the ocean. And that’s just one accident. How many other accidents have there been? Can we clean the plastic out of the water?
