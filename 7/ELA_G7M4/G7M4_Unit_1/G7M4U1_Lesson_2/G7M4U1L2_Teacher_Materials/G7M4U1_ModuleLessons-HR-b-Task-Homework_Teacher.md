Homework: Reflect on Film: Lesson 2

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** In the space below, write a brief paragraph reflecting on what you have seen of the documentary *A Plastic Ocean* so far, including questions you have.

Answers will vary but may include: So far in *A Plastic Ocean*, we have seen images of whales and other marine life having to deal with a large amount of plastic in the ocean. This was upsetting to see, especially after we saw the beauty of the whale in the clear ocean. We also saw images and statistics to help us understand how much plastic is made and used every day. The image of the narrator sitting on a pile of plastic really helped to show the problem.

Some of my questions are: When did we start using so much plastic? Is there any way to get the plastic out of the ocean?
