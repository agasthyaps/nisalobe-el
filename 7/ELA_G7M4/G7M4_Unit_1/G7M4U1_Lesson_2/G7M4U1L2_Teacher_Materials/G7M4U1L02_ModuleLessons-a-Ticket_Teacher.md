(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, respond to the following prompts.

Read the following excerpt of a film transcript that you will study in this lesson. Then respond in writing to the prompts below.

TRANSCRIPT: Plastic production globally is expected to be more than 300 million tons, half of which we’ll use just once . . . and then throw away. By 2050, when the population explodes to almost ten billion people, it’s expected that plastic production will triple. The problem with that is that today only a fraction of the plastic that we produce is recycled. The rest ends up in our environment, and it’s coating our land and our oceans like a disease. (15:24–15:54)

What is the gist of this excerpt?

People are making, using, and throwing away tons of plastic that ends up ruining the land and ocean.

What thoughts or questions do you have about it?

Responses will vary, but may include: It is overwhelming and troubling to read and think about how much plastic we make, use, and throw away. I have many questions: Why do we use so much plastic? Don’t we recycle plastic? What happens to recycled plastic?
