<p>TRANSCRIPT: Plastic production globally is expected to be more than 300 million tons, half of which we’ll use just once . . . and then throw away. By 2050, when the population explodes to almost ten billion people, it’s expected that plastic production will triple. The problem with that is that today only a fraction of the plastic that we produce is recycled. The rest ends up in our environment, and it’s coating our land and our oceans like a disease. (15:24–15:54)</p>
<p>How do the techniques in the video add to the meaning of the transcript and help develop ideas?</p>
<p>The video starts off by showing <strong>a lot of plastic to develop the ideas of how much plastic is being made and used.</strong> Next, the video shows <strong>the speaker sitting on a large mound of plastic.</strong> This makes the statistic in the transcript <strong>about the large amount of plastic even clearer.</strong> The camera zooms out, and we see <strong>how large the pile of plastic is.</strong> Then, at the end of the video <strong>there appears a graphic and text to tell how much plastic has been produced since we started watching this video.</strong> The graphic and text make the point from the transcript about <strong>the amount of plastic even clearer.</strong></p></td>
