<p>TRANSCRIPT: Plastic production globally is expected to be more than 300 million tons, half of which we’ll use just once . . . and then throw away. By 2050, when the population explodes to almost ten billion people, it’s expected that plastic production will triple. The problem with that is that today only a fraction of the plastic that we produce is recycled. The rest ends up in our environment, and it’s coating our land and our oceans like a disease.
