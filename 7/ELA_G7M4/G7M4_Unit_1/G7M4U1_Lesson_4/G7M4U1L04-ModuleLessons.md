Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- SL.7.3 – Opening A: On an entrance ticket, students recall their work analyzing arguments in the previous modules and brainstorm ideas about how argument analysis will apply to a documentary video.

- RI.7.7 – Work Time A: Students watch a clip of *A Plastic Ocean* to determine the main ideas and compare a portion of the transcript to an excerpt from the video.

- SL.7.3 – Work Time B: Students rewatch the clip of *A Plastic Ocean* and analyze a claim made in the video.

- SL.7.3 – Closing and Assessment A: Students answer selected response questions about the clip of *A Plastic Ocean* that they watched and analyzed in class today.

- For homework, students continue their work with grammar skills, particularly correcting dangling modifiers. They have worked with this concept in previous units and will review it in Closing and Assessment A.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners by working independently to analyze a video and collaborating as a class to delineate the arguments in the documentary video.

- The Think-Pair-Share protocol is used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- In the clip of *A Plastic Ocean* viewed in this lesson, the people involved in cleaning up the ocean demonstrate perseverance and taking initiative. They also collaborated with others and contribute to a better world by improving their shared spaces and environment.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release responsibility more quickly to students as they comprehend the tasks or concepts. For example:

- Students who show a greater understanding of the techniques used in the video can move on to answering the questions sooner.

- If students complete their note-catchers and finish their questions early, allow them to view other parts of the documentary and analyze the techniques and arguments in those clips. Possible clips to analyze include: 14:35–15:57, 19:02–20:00, 37:10–40:32, 1:05:28–1:06:47, 1:09:42–1:11:40, 1:20:53–1:22:22, 1:23:53–1:25:21, 1:35:10–1:35:45.

- Students who finish early may also want to further research ideas and claims made in the documentary. Allow those students the opportunity to research and share what they find with their peers.

- Students who demonstrate greater facility with analyzing arguments can explore the claims being made in the video through further research or by mentoring peers in understanding the claims.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students have focused on analyzing the documentary *A Plastic Ocean* for the techniques the filmmakers use to convey the ideas in the video. In this lesson, students continue this work and also begin delineating the arguments made in the video, focusing on a claim made by a speaker.

Support All Students

- The subject matter in this film includes descriptions of the environmental impact of plastic pollution, such as harm to animals and humans. Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this chapter that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually. To support students in processing this content, ask: “What habit of character did you use as you watched and discussed this film?” Students may need to draw on perseverance, empathy, and compassion as they read and discuss this content, being sensitive to their own and others’ reactions to the information presented.

- Students may need additional support with reading and understanding the transcript and how it relates to the video. The lesson suggests several opportunities for replaying the clip to allow for comprehension, but consider providing more opportunities for those students struggling with analysis of the video or providing individual devices and headphones for students to watch and rewatch the clip at their own pace. ▲

- Note there is a differentiated version of the Analyze *A Plastic Ocean* (36:50–40:35) note-catcher used in Work Time B in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- If students need additional support with the note-catcher, pull small groups or individual students to coach them as needed. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson supports students with modeling as they participate in whole-class analysis of a film clip for its argument. Also, students work in pairs to analyze the film clip for its techniques and how it compares to the transcript.

- ELLs may find it challenging to understand the content of the film well enough to analyze the speaker’s argument. In addition to the suggestions below, consider playing the film with subtitles. Also, before playing the film, encourage students to read the transcript and identify the argument and evidence so they can be listening for these as they watch the film. Finally, play the film clip multiple times, or allow students to view the clip as many times as necessary before participating in analysis.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, 7.I.B.6, 7.I.C.10, and 7.I.C.11.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Analyze *A Plastic Ocean* (36:50–40:35) note-catcher to ensure they understand how the video conveys ideas as well as how to delineate and evaluate a claim made by a speaker in the video.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue to develop their video analysis skills, build background knowledge, and continue their work analyzing claims made by a speaker in the video by viewing and analyzing another clip from *A Plastic Ocean*.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – SL.7.3 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 4**.

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use **equity sticks** to review their responses. Record *argument*, *claim*, *evidence*, *reasoning*, *relevance*, *sufficiency*, and *soundness* on the **academic word wall** with translations in home languages, where appropriate, and invite students to record words in their **vocabulary logs**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

- With students, use the vocabulary strategies on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart** to deconstruct the words *delineate* (to trace or tell the details of) and *evaluate* (to judge). Record the words on the academic word wall with translations in home languages, where appropriate, and invite students to record words in their vocabulary logs.

For Lighter Support

- For the entrance ticket in Opening A, encourage students to independently grapple to recall the definitions of the argument terms before using their vocabulary logs, peer support, or a dictionary. Grappling first and then working with a partner will increase student engagement, independence, and language acquisition skills.

For Heavier Support

- For the entrance ticket in Opening A, encourage students to work in pairs to grapple to recall the definitions of the argument terms before using their vocabulary logs or a dictionary. Grappling first will increase student engagement, confidence, and language acquisition skills.

Work Time

A. Watch and Analyze the Video – RI.7.7 (15 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can compare the way a transcript of *A Plastic Ocean* portrays a subject to the way it is portrayed in the video.”

- Inform students that they will view another clip from ***A Plastic Ocean***, analyzing the first half of their note-catchers with partners, before moving on as a class to look at the argument.

- Invite students to join with partners and distribute the **Analyze *A Plastic Ocean*** **(36:50–40:35) note-catcher** and the **Analyze *A Plastic Ocean*** **(36:50–40:35) note-catcher** ▲ as necessary. The differentiated note-catcher supports students’ comprehension and writing with sentence starters. ▲ Note that the first part of this note-catcher is the same as the one they used in the previous lesson but that the second part is different. The class will review and use the second part of the note-catcher in the following activity.

- Tell students that they will view the clip twice for this section of analysis on the note-catcher. Remind students to focus on finding the gist, main ideas, and some techniques for how the main ideas are developed in the video. Display the **Techniques anchor chart** to guide students in their analysis. Play the clip (36:50–40:35) of *A Plastic Ocean*. Invite students to Turn and Talk with their partners about what they noticed for the gist, main ideas, and techniques in this clip.

- Play the clip again and give students the opportunity to complete Part I of their note-catchers. Use a total participation technique to review student responses. For model responses, see the **Analyze** ***A Plastic Ocean*** **(36:50–40:35) note-catcher (example for teacher reference)**.

- Once students have finished watching and reflecting on the clip, ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What habits of character did you see in this clip? Who demonstrated them? What did they look/sound like?” (Possible response: In the clip of *A Plastic Ocean* viewed in this lesson, the people involved in cleaning up the ocean demonstrate perseverance and taking initiative. They also collaborated with others and contributed to a better world by improving their shared spaces and environment.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Work Time

B. Delineate and Evaluate a Speaker’s Argument – SL.7.3 (15 minutes)

- Review appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can delineate a speaker’s argument and claims in *A Plastic Ocean*.”

- Tell students they will now analyze a claim made by a speaker in the clip. Ask students to refer back to their entrance tickets to remind them of their work with argument terms in Modules 2 and 3.

- Point out Part II on the note-catcher, where students will delineate and evaluate a claim and note that the second part of the note-catcher is similar to note-catchers they used in Module 2. As necessary, review the note-catcher with students, asking them to Think-Pair-Share:

“What do we record in each row for Part II of the note-catcher?” (We record the claim in the first row, the evidence in the second row, and the reasoning in the third row.)

“How does the information in each row relate to each other?” (The evidence and reasoning in the second and third rows support and explain the claim in the first row.)

“What do we do in the second column? How does the information in the second column relate to the information in the first column?” (We underline *yes* or *no* to evaluate the evidence and reasoning in the first column.)

- Ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“What do we look for when evaluating claims? How might a filmmaker develop and support claims differently than a writer?” (We look for evidence to back up a claim and for reasoning to show how the evidence and claim are related. Filmmakers can use images, graphics, and other elements to present evidence that develops a claim. For example, someone could use an image of plastic in the ocean to support the claim that plastic ends up in the ocean.)

- Ask students to keep these techniques and terms in mind as they watch the clip and take notes using their note-catchers. Point out that the claim they will evaluate is provided on their note-catchers: “Once you let people know what the problem is, people have their own ideas and can contribute their own ingenuity to help solve the problem.” Ask students to Turn and Talk to paraphrase this claim, explaining to what “problem” the claim is likely referring. (When people know about the problem of plastic pollution, they use their own ideas and innovations to help solve the problem.)

- Inform students that they will watch the clip twice and discuss how the claim is supported as a class.

- Play the clip (36:50–40:35) of *A Plastic Ocean*. Use a whole-class participation technique to ask students what evidence the speaker and the filmmakers use to support the claim “Once you let people know what the problem is, people have their own ideas and can contribute their own ingenuity to help solve the problem.” For model responses, see the Analyze *A Plastic Ocean* (36:50–40:35) note-catcher (example for teacher reference).

- Play the clip again and ask students to pay attention to the reasoning the speaker uses to support his claim. After the clip is finished, use a whole-class participation technique to ask students about the reasoning used to support the claim and how it connects the evidence to the claim. For model responses, see the Analyze *A Plastic Ocean* (36:50–40:35) note-catcher (example for teacher reference).

- Direct students’ attention to the questions below the chart in Part II of their note-catchers: “Who is stating the claim and why? How does this affect your evaluation of the claim?” (The narrator of the movie is making the claim in order to support the idea that plastic pollution should be reduced. We know he believes this because he helped make the movie. However, this doesn’t necessarily change how we evaluate the claim if we believe his argument is sound.)

- Ask for student volunteers to share why they are answering these questions. Why is it important to think about who is stating the claims in the video and why this person is stating these claims? (We are answering these questions because analyzing the source of a claim is important. People have different reasons for making claims, and understanding their biases can help us determine if a source is credible.)

- Review student responses, then ask them to work in pairs to synthesize their evaluation of the argument on the note-catcher. Students will determine whether the overall argument is strong by evaluating the relevance and sufficiency of evidence and the soundness of reasoning. For model responses, see Analyze *A Plastic Ocean* (36:50–40:35) note-catcher (example for teacher reference).

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- For Work Time B, students may need more support in addition to the whole-class analysis of the speaker’s argument. Provide additional wait time for students to process the questions, film evidence, and formulate their responses. Students may also need time to orally process their responses with a partner before sharing out.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time B, invite students to use the Analyze *A Plastic Ocean* (36:50–40:35) note-catcher ▲. This resource features sentence starters that support students with comprehension and writing.

- For Work Time B, students may need more support in addition to the whole-class analysis of the speaker’s argument. Provide additional wait time for students to process the questions, film evidence, and formulate their responses. Also, record student responses on the board or a displayed version of the note-catcher to support students visually. Before sharing out, students may also need time to orally process their responses with a partner in English or their home language.

Closing and Assessment

A. Answer Questions – RI.7.7 (10 minutes)

- Direct students’ attention to the questions on Part III of their note-catchers. Play the clip one more time, and have students answer the questions in Part III. Invite students to work in small groups to answer the questions.

- Play the clip, and circulate and support students as necessary. Then use equity sticks to review student responses.

- Ask students to retrieve their homework resources and find the assignment for this lesson. Read the instructional information aloud, and ensure students understand dangling modifiers. Remind students that they have learned about dangling modifiers in the Language Dives throughout Modules 2 and 3. Then read the directions aloud and model completing the first item, explaining that modifying phrases refer to a noun in the sentence. Have students work with a partner to complete the second item. Use a total participation technique to review their responses. As necessary, draw together a group of students who need more support to further review dangling modifiers by completing the remaining item as a group. ▲

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Reflect on Film

- Students write a brief paragraph about what they have seen of the documentary *A Plastic Ocean* so far, including questions they have, to complete **Homework: Reflect on Film: Lesson 4**.

B. Identify Correct and Incorrect Modifiers

- Students identify sentences with and without dangling modifiers to complete **Homework: Identify Correct and Incorrect Modifiers**.

For Lighter Support

- Before students leave class, ask them to read the homework assignments and discuss them with a partner. Ensure students understand the purpose of the QuickWrite is to reflect on or think about the documentary. They should focus on expressing their ideas more than on spelling, grammar, or punctuation. Encourage students to spend time discussing their responses to the film in order to prepare them to write for homework.

For Heavier Support

- Before students leave class, ask them to read the homework assignments and discuss them with a partner. Ensure students understand the purpose of the QuickWrite is to reflect on or think about the documentary. They should focus on expressing their ideas more than on spelling, grammar, or punctuation. Students literate in their home language can respond in it. Encourage students to spend time discussing their responses to the film in either English or their home language in order to prepare them to write for homework.
