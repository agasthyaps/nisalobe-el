**Directions:** As you enter class, respond to the following prompts.

Today you will analyze a short clip from the documentary *A Plastic Ocean* and focus on a claim the narrator makes. Recall your work with arguments in previous modules. Write down below what you remember about the definitions for the argument terms.

argument:

an assertion or opinion and its supporting points, evidence, and reasoning

claim:

a statement of opinion that can be proven or disproven with evidence and reasoning

point:

an important idea or reason used to support a claim

evidence:

information such as examples, data, facts, quotes, etc., that support an idea

reasoning:

explanations of why a claim is true, including how the evidence proves the claim

relevance:

related to the claim being made

sufficiency:

being enough or adequate

soundness:

having a solid base; making sense

How do we use these terms to analyze arguments? How do you think these terms will apply in analyzing a video?

We use these terms to judge whether an argument someone makes is supported. In a video, people might use evidence such as images or interviews to support their claims.
