<p>TRANSCRIPT: CRAIG: Six containers full of nurdles. All of them broke up in the storm and disgorged most of their plastic bags into the sea. The vast majority broke open, and the contents spilled out. Run them through your fingers there.</p>
<p>TRACEY: Just plastic pellets everywhere. It looked like snow on the beach. (37:18–37:56)</p>
<p>How do the techniques in the video add to the meaning of the transcript and help develop ideas?</p>
<p>The video does a good job of showing <strong>what the spilled plastic looks like as well as the damage it does.</strong> The first part of the video contains <strong>no narration, just images of dead fish and shots of the nurdles polluting the environment.</strong> These images give <strong>a vivid picture of the destructive effects of nurdles.</strong></p></td>

**Part II**

**Directions:** In the boxes below, record the evidence and reasoning the speaker uses to support the given claim. If a claim has multiple pieces of supporting evidence and reasoning, record them all in the boxes below the claim. Then evaluate whether the evidence is relevant and sufficient and the reasoning is sound, and underline YES or NO in the right-hand column.

Who is making the claim, and why? How does this affect your evaluation of the claim?

The narrator of the movie is making the claim to support the idea that plastic pollution should be reduced. We know he believes this because he helped make the movie. However, the examples still show that people will help once they understand the problem.

Evaluate the overall argument in this part of the film. Is the evidence sufficient and relevant? Is the reasoning sound? How do the speaker’s viewpoints influence the strength of the argument?

The claim is that people will help once they know the problem. The evidence is relevant because it relates to the topic. The evidence is sufficient because it shows how, in Hong Kong, once people knew about the nurdles spill, they came to help. The reasoning is sound because the speakers show the connection between telling people about the problem and those people coming to help. The speakers are likely biased because they believe people should help. However, the argument is still strong because the evidence and reasoning support the claim that people will help when they are made aware of the problem.

**Part III**

**Directions:** Answer the following questions to demonstrate your understanding of the video clip.

1.  Reread this excerpt from the transcript and answer the question that follows.

We put a call to action out on Facebook: Go to your local beach, this is what you’re looking for. These are the bags, these are the pellets.

What idea or claim in the clip does the footage of the man at the computer develop? (RI.7.7)

2.  The plastic problem is overwhelming.

3.  It is impossible to filter plastic out of the oceans.

4.  Recycling is the best way to reduce plastic pollution.

5.  <u>People will help address the plastic problem if asked.</u>

6.  Read the excerpt from the transcript and answer the question below.

CRAIG: On the neighboring Lamma Island, they found tons of this stuff that had come ashore. It seems the company that made the nurdles has unwittingly put their signature on them—Sinopec, a giant Chinese oil company that makes nurdles for distribution worldwide. (37:59–38:11)

What technique is used to show the information in this excerpt from the transcript? (RI.7.7)

7.  <u>images of the nurdles and a bag they came in</u>

8.  graphics explaining what nurdles are composed of
