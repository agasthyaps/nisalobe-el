Homework: Reflect on Film: Lesson 4

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Respond in writing to the following prompt.

1.  In the space below, write a brief paragraph reflecting on what you have seen of the documentary *A Plastic Ocean* so far, including questions you have.

Answers will vary but may include: In the video today, we saw what happens when containers of plastic nurdles are spilled into the ocean. The nurdles were everywhere, covering beaches and being swallowed by wildlife. This was difficult to watch, but it was also inspiring to see how many people got involved to clean up the beach once they heard about it. This makes me wonder, what else can be done to inspire people to help out with plastic pollution?
