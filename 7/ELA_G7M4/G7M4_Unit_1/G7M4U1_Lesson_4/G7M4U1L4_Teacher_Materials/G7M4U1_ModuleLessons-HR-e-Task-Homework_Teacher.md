Homework: Identify Correct and  
Incorrect Modifiers

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Read the instructions, and respond to the items below.

Dangling modifiers are phrases that are meant to describe a noun in a sentence, but do not have a clear connection to the noun they are describing. This causes confusion in a sentence.

Here is an example of a sentence that has a clear connection between the modifying phrase and the noun it is modifying:

**After cleaning up the nurdles,** <u>Tracey</u> moved on to the next task.

In this sentence, the phrase **after cleaning up the nurdles** is clearly describing something that **Tracey** just did. Compare this to the following sentence:

After cleaning up the nurdles, the next task was started.

This sentence is confusing because it isn’t clear who or what the phrase **after cleaning up the nurdles** is referring to. As readers, we may sense that the phrase is talking about a person, but the sentence does not tell us that person’s name. This makes the sentence confusing.

**Directions:** Practice identifying dangling modifiers and correct sentences below. For each item, put a check mark next to the correct sentence and underline the noun that the phrase in bold is modifying. (L.7.1c)
