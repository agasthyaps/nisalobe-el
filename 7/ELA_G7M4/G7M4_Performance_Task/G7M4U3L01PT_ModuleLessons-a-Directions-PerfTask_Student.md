For your performance task, you will work in a group of three to create a 3- to 5-minute documentary clip on plastic pollution, how best to solve it, and your action plan for attempting the solution. The purpose of this clip is to teach others about the plastic pollution problem and what can be done about it. This video clip will be based on the plans you developed, which will include your script, storyboard, and a description of your action plan and its effects.

Your script should include

- a narrative lead introduction;

- your argument about why we need to solve the problem of plastic pollution, which is based on a claim supported by evidence and reasoning;

- an explanation of your triad’s action plan and its results;

- a conclusion that follows from and offers a reflection on the possible impact of your action plan; and

- several of the documentary film techniques your class identified (interviews, music, visuals, re-enactments, narration, close-ups, and statistics).

Your storyboard should include the following:

- Images (either hand-drawn or clip art) to represent

- each scene in your script

- the actors

- the camera angles

- the techniques

- Captions telling what is happening and who is in the scene

To celebrate this powerful learning and make a difference in the world, host a film screening at your school or in your community (possibly at the public library, local community center, or another public space).
