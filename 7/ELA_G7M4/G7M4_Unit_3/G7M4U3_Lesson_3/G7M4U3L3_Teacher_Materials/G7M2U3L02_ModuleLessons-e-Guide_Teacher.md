(For Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Review the steps below, and teach only those that the class needs to learn. If there is a small group of students who need to learn more of the steps, release the other students to begin researching.

**1. Refine Research Questions:** Explain that when we research, we often have to break our initial research question into smaller, more specific questions. Model selecting a general open-ended question from the anchor chart, and use a think-aloud to demonstrate breaking it into smaller questions. For example,

Explain that once we have a few more specific questions, we can begin to conduct research. Focus students on the Researchers Do These Things anchor chart, and read aloud the first three bullet points, noting that we have already completed the first two and will now move on to the third step: use search terms in a search engine to find sources to help answer questions. Also, explain that as students complete the different phases of research, they may find that they can refine their research question further or even modify it depending on the information that they find. ▲

**2. Use a Search Engine:** Display a search engine (such as <http://eled.org/0140>), and model brainstorming search terms or keywords to find sources to answer the model question (disease; conditions for disease; miasma; humors and disease; hygiene and disease; germs and disease; sanitation and disease; overcrowding and disease). If students have a lot of experience with online research, teach them advanced search tricks, or have a knowledgeable student do so. If students are new to using a search engine for research, teach them the basics of brainstorming and refining search terms or keywords. If necessary, note these steps on the Researchers Do These Things anchor chart:

If necessary, provide a list of keywords students can use to answer their research questions.

**3. Determine the Relevance of Sources:** Model scanning the results page to identify the relevance of sources. Explain that **relevance** means related to what is being discussed, and give examples from everyday life: “If we are having a discussion about our favorite fruits and I suddenly start talking about my shoes, my comment will have no relevance in this discussion. But if I talk about apples, then my comment does have relevance in this discussion.” If necessary, use visuals or sketches to illustrate **relevance** (pictures of fruit and a picture of shoes with question mark or X through it). Model scanning the results page and asking,

Invite students to join in evaluating the relevance of the sources.

**4. Determine the Credibility of Sources:** Explain that once researchers have identified relevant sources, they have to determine the credibility of a source. Explain that **credibility** means being believable. Have students reference Choose and Use Credible Internet Sources on the Researcher’s Tool Box handout, and read aloud the first bullet (about the publisher), asking students to follow along. Model using this criterion to evaluate the relevant sources on the results page. Invite students to join in evaluating the credibility of the sources. Click on one of the sources, and read aloud each of the other bullet points from Choose and Use Credible Internet Sources, using them as a checklist to verify the credibility of the source. Invite students to join in evaluating the credibility of the source. If students need additional support or practice, display several different sources and ask students to work together to label them as credible or not.

**5. Gather Information: Paraphrase and Quote:** Model skimming and scanning the first one or two paragraphs of the source for information. Ask students if there is a single sentence in that section of text that addresses the research question. If so, explain that students might want to record this quote. Invite students to refer to Quoting Accurately on the Researcher’s Tool Box handout, and model recording the quote on the displayed epidemics research planner and note-catcher.

If there isn’t a single sentence that addresses the research question, but there is information across the two paragraphs of text that answers the research question, explain that students will want to paraphrase the relevant information that addresses the research question into a sentence or two on their note-catchers. Invite students to turn to a partner and use the information in the first couple of paragraphs to orally express information that addresses the research question in one or two sentences. Select a couple of students to share whole group. Explain that that this is paraphrasing the information, and model recording a paraphrasing example on the displayed note-catcher.

If necessary, repeat this process with the next few paragraphs, asking students to help paraphrase and quote. Release students to repeat this process in pairs and then independently with the next paragraphs.

**6. Gather Information: Cite Sources:** Model using the citing sources format in the Citing Sources section of the Researchers Tool Box handout. Instruct students on the necessity of citing sources for each of their quotes and paraphrases to avoid plagiarism, which is the use of someone else’s work without permission. Invite students to help find each item (author’s last and first name, article title, website, etc.). Optionally, make the finding of items like a game—the first to find an item shouts it out or runs up and points it out.
