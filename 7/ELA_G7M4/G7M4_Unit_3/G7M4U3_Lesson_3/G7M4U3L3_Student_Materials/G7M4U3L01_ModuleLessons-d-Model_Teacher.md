**Narrative Lead:**

Recently, I was at my favorite spot at the river, in the middle of a very hot day, getting ready to jump in and cool off, when something out in the middle of the flowing water caught my eye. For a second I thought it might be a bird or a turtle resting on a rock, but I looked more closely and saw a plastic bag snagged on the branch of a tree. Immediately I thought of what we’d read about plastic pollution in class. How animals could swallow plastic or get caught in it. How plastic could end up in our drinking water or even our food. I rushed out into the river like a lifeguard to the rescue and unhooked the bag. I looked at the bag and realized that the plastic pollution problem I’d been reading about was not far away. It was right in my own town, right at my favorite river spot. The day seemed a little less bright when I sat down and started to unpack the sandwich I’d picked up for lunch. I pulled it out of the bag and started to remove the wrapper. I suddenly realized what I held in my hand: I might have caught one plastic bag, but here I was carrying another. I always did my best to recycle, but couldn’t I do more to stop plastic pollution?

**Argument:**

States a claim about plastic pollution.

Supports the claim with evidence that includes relevant facts, statistics, and quotations.

Explains evidence with reasoning.

Do you know how big of a problem plastic pollution has become? Plastic bottles, bags, containers, and other items fill up our landfills and take hundreds of years to even start to decay. A lot of this plastic ends up polluting our oceans. According to Jessica Hullinger of *The Week* magazine, “as much as 8 million metric tons of plastic found its way to the ocean in 2010.” Where does all this plastic come from? There are many forms of plastic pollution, but let’s just focus on the kind I was carrying to the river with me that day. According to the documentary *A Plastic Ocean*, “80 million tons of waste in the U.S. alone, every year, comes from plastic food packaging.” Anjali Acharya, writing for the World Bank, reports that an estimated “1 million plastic bags \[are\] used every minute.” Also, “plastic food packaging represents the majority of municipal waste.” It is clear that the choices we make as individuals have an impact on plastic pollution. We might enjoy the convenience of using plastic to carry our food, but it comes at a cost.

Introduces the proposed solution.

**Action Plan:**

Thinking about what to do about plastic pollution can be overwhelming. But the more I researched, the more it seemed that the best way I could start to reduce plastic pollution was by using less plastic food packaging. I knew from my research that there are many ways we can reduce plastic pollution. But making a change at the middle of the plastic life cycle, as a consumer, seemed the most effective and most immediate action I could take. So here’s what I tried for a week. I brought my own reusable food containers to a restaurant or takeout to avoid using their plastic containers. It felt a little awkward and embarrassing at first, but the restaurant owners were actually really cool about it. I even found one restaurant owner who shared my concerns.

(Dialogue from the video:)

**Emma**: Hello, Shawn.

**Shawn**: Hello, Emma.

**Emma** (voiceover narration): Shawn is the owner of Three Spoons. She’s made progress in using sustainable material for her takeout items.

Explains the personal action plan.

Explains the results of the action plan.

**Shawn**: Here at Three Spoons we really only use paper takeout items for our to-go containers. We wrap our pastries in paper and place them in a paper bag for customers. We only supply straws if people ask for them, and the ones we provide, though expensive, are worth it. They’re compostable. They aren’t the perfect solution, but they work for now.

**Emma** (voiceover narration): My conversation with Shawn was inspiring. If I hadn’t tried out my own action plan I might never have learned about her efforts.

**Conclusion:**

Conclusion that follows from and offers a reflection that focuses on the impact of the action taken.

It felt good to use less plastic, even though sometimes it meant having tough conversations or planning ahead to bring my own containers. To keep myself motivated, I thought about how I wasn’t just doing it for me. I pictured the sea turtle we learned about that ate a plastic bag out of confusion. I thought of the bag I picked up from the river and how I was lucky to get to it before it hurt an animal or ended up out in the ocean. It also helped to remember that I was not alone. According to Danielle Smith-Llera in her book *Trash Vortex*, “Every day people fight the war on plastic pollution.” In my research, I found that there were efforts to ban single-use plastic around the world. People are working to make recycling easier and more efficient, and inventors are coming up with new ways to clean our oceans. I will continue to do my part. I will bring my own containers instead of using disposable plastic ones. I will encourage others to do the same. I will see if I can get restaurants to support this work, inviting customers to bring their own reusable containers, and rid themselves of plastic bags. I will become part of the solution.
