Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- SL.7.4 – Opening A: On an entrance ticket, students grapple with the elements of a good pitch for their documentary clips.

- SL.7.4 – Work Time A: Students observe and analyze a model documentary pitch.

- SL.7.4 – Work Time B: Students plan and practice their documentary pitches, making sure to include the necessary elements to explain their ideas and convey their excitement about the project to their peers.

- SL.7.4 – Closing and Assessment A: Students engage in a Tuning protocol to practice and improve presentation skills for their pitch, such as adequate volume, eye contact, and clear pronunciation.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to contribute to a better world by improving their presentation skills for the class, the school, the community, and even the world.

- The Tuning protocol is used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- Students practice presenting their documentary film pitch before and during the Tuning protocol.

- If homework is not an option for students and they didn’t finish their storyboard in the previous lesson, then they can work with their triad to finish their storyboard in Work Time A of this lesson.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release more responsibility more quickly to students as they comprehend the tasks or concepts. For example:

- Allow those students who have expertise with presentation skills to offer their services as “expert presenters” to other groups who may need some modeling of presentation skills.

- Students who need more of a challenge can complete the following activities:

- Research pitches used in other areas such as advertising, business, and marketing. What do all pitches have in common? What makes them different?

- Find video clips of people giving pitches from films or from real life. Present the video clips as exemplars, explaining what makes it a strong pitch; or discuss the learning opportunities and how the presenters could improve their pitch.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students focused on drafting their scripts and creating storyboards to prepare for making their documentary clips. In this lesson, they practice their pitches for their documentaries, using their storyboards and scripts to explain their ideas and excite their audience about their projects.

Support All Students

- The subject matter of the documentary clips may include descriptions of pollution or mention of harm to humans, animals, and wildlife. Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of this content that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually. To support students in processing this content, ask: “What habit of character did you use as you discussed these ideas?” Students may need to draw on perseverance, empathy, or compassion as they read and discuss this content, being sensitive to their own and others’ reactions to the information presented.

- Students may need additional support providing feedback in the Tuning protocol. They may need to listen to their classmates’ documentary pitch presentation more than once. Provide these students with a copy of the documentary script to read ahead of time to familiarize themselves with the content and related issues. If possible, record the presentations and give students the opportunity to listen to their recording multiple times, in a quieter space, before providing feedback. ▲

- Give students an opportunity to move to quieter spaces in the classroom or use “office cubbies” to help them focus during the presentation practice and Tuning protocol. ▲

- Invite students to voice-record their revisions to their documentary clip pitch if writing or typing while listening to feedback is too challenging. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson provides students with modeling of a documentary pitch as well as peer-supported practice and tuning.

- ELLs may find it challenging to present their work to others. Ensure students who are most reluctant to share are in supportive groups by placing their triad with another group of similar level or home language, if possible.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, and 7.I.C.10.

Assessment Guidance

- Circulate as students present their documentary clip pitch, ensuring they are practicing and improving their presentation skills. Also, review students’ Presentation checklists to ensure success on the End of Unit 3 Assessment.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will present their documentary clip pitch for the End of Unit 3 Assessment.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – SL.7.4 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 10**.

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique to review sample responses.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

- Encourage students to first grapple to independently respond to the prompts on the entrance ticket. Then they can share their ideas with a partner. Grappling first will increase students’ confidence and success on future independent writing tasks.

For Heavier Support

- Encourage students to work with a partner to discuss and respond to the prompts on the entrance ticket. Collaboration ensures comprehension and success on the task as well as an opportunity to practice speaking and listening skills.

Work Time

A. Model Documentary Clip Pitch – SL.7.4 (10 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can present my documentary pitch in a formal, focused, and clear way, emphasizing important points.”

“I can use appropriate eye contact, adequate volume, and clear pronunciation to present.”

“I can use visual displays in my storyboard to clarify and emphasize points.”

- Ask students to retrieve their **Presentation checklists** and focus on the following criteria:

- SL.7.4: I use adequate volume. I use appropriate eye contact. I use clear pronunciation.

- SL.7.5: I include multimedia components and visual displays in presentations to clarify claims and findings and emphasize salient points.

- SL.7.6: I adapt speech to a variety of contexts and tasks, demonstrating command of formal English when indicated or appropriate.

- Invite students to text code, mark, highlight, or annotate these criteria, as they will be the focus of the Tuning protocol. Have students Turn and Talk to say the criteria in their own words, recording these paraphrases in the third column of their Presentation checklists. As necessary, model doing so with one of the criteria, recording paraphrases on the board for students to reference. Consult the **Presentation checklist (example for teacher reference)** for sample responses.

- Explain that the documentary clip pitch should include the following elements:

- An overview of the clip and an explanation of why you are making it

- A description of some of the key scenes, using the storyboard as reference

- A closing statement reiterating the importance of making the documentary clip

- Each partner will be responsible for one of the sections and must meet all the criteria for an effective presentation in their section, including presenting claims and findings, emphasizing points and including descriptions, facts, details, and examples.

- Display the **Model Documentary Script** and **Storyboard** and explain that they will now see a model documentary pitch. Distribute the **Documentary Pitch note-catcher**, and explain that in Section 1 of the note-catcher, students will take notes on what they notice about the model pitch. In Section 2 of the note-catcher, students will take notes to plan their own documentary pitch. In Section 3 of the note-catcher, students will take notes on another triad’s documentary pitch during the Tuning protocol.

- Present the **Model Documentary Clip Pitch**, pausing after each part to ensure students are taking notes. After presenting, use **equity sticks** to review students’ notes. Ensure students understand the nature of a pitch and what makes a pitch effective. For sample notes, see the **Documentary Pitch note-catcher (example for reference).**

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time A, ensure students understand each part of the pitch by speaking slowly and pausing frequently. Also, consider whether students would benefit from prereading and following along with the **Documentary Pitch note-catcher** (example for teacher reference) and provide copies to those students who need this visual content support.

- In Work Time A, students may be overwhelmed by the many presentation skills (volume, pacing, clarity, and emphasis). Encourage students to work on only one or two skills each time they practice their pitch.

Work Time

B. Practice Documentary Clip Pitch – SL.7.4 (15 minutes)

- Explain to students that now they will practice presenting their documentary clip pitch with another triad, coaching one another on clarity, emphasis of important points, eye contact, adequate volume, clear pronunciation, and formal English. Additionally, they will support one another with their use of storyboards to clarify and emphasize points.

- Ask students to form triads and work for several minutes using their Documentary Pitch note-catcher to plan their documentary pitch, including who will present each part, what they will say, and how they will use the storyboard to emphasize their points.

- Circulate to ensure students are taking notes and planning their pitch. Remind students that they do not need to write out every word they will say, but should use notes to help them remember the important parts of their talk to get their classmates excited about their documentary clip. For sample notes, see the Documentary Pitch note-catcher (example for reference). If necessary, display the sample notes for students who may benefit from reading and using example sentences as frames for their own thinking and writing. ▲

- After several minutes, transition triads from planning their pitch to practicing it. Circulate to support students in taking turns to present different parts of the pitch, and ensuring that they divide the work evenly.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time B, challenge students to model giving their portion of their pitch with the appropriate volume, pace, clarity, and emphasis. Direct them to coach their classmates who need heavier support on their presentation skills.

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time B, students may be overwhelmed by the many presentation skills (volume, pacing, clarity, and emphasis). Encourage students to work on only one or two skills each time they practice their pitch.

- In Work Time B, provide sentence frames for students to use in giving feedback. For example:

- Your volume/pacing/clarity/emphasis was good because I could . . .

- Next time you present, can you try . . . because . . .

Closing and Assessment

A. Tuning Protocol: Presentation Skills – SL.7.4 (15 minutes)

- Explain to students that they will now present their documentary clip pitch to another triad to get feedback on their presentation skills.

- Move students into partnerships with another triad group, and invite them to label their triads A and B.

- Provide students with the opportunity to make notes to help them with their presentations, using the blank spaces in the model note-catchers, and discuss them with their triads. Remind students that they should divide the work of the presentation evenly. Although not each member of the triad needs to present each part of the pitch, they should take turns to make the work as equal as possible.

- Distribute **sticky notes**.

- Focus students on the **Work to Contribute to a Better World anchor chart**, specifically “I use my strengths to help others grow.” Remind students that as they work to critique their partner’s work, they will need to use their strengths.

- Tell students they are going to provide their partners with kind, specific, and helpful feedback against the criteria.

- Direct students’ attention to the **Peer Critique anchor chart**, and remind them of what peer critique looks and sounds like.

- Display and distribute **Directions for a Tuning Protocol**, and review them as necessary. Invite students to share issues, solutions, and best practices for Tuning a protocol.

- Ask students to retrieve their **documentary storyboard and script**, and Presentation checklists. Encourage them to provide feedback to their classmates based on the Presentation checklist. Remind students to consider their peers’ use of language. Are they using formal English? Are they using conventions so that everyone can understand what they mean?

- Circulate to support students as they work to give feedback to one another.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- At the end of the Tuning protocol, allow several minutes for students to self-assess whether they are prepared to give their pitch on an assessment in the following lesson. If not, consider providing an additional day of practice.

For Heavier Support

- In Closing and Assessment A, provide sentence frames for students to use in giving feedback. For example:

- Your volume/pacing/clarity/emphasis was good because I could . . .

- Next time you present, can you try . . . because . . .

- Circulate during the Tuning protocol to ensure that students are prepared to give their pitch on an assessment in the following lesson. If not, consider providing an additional day of practice.

Homework

A. Optional: Practice Documentary Pitch and Begin Filming

- Students have the option to practice their documentary clip pitch, focusing on the part of the pitch they are responsible for in their triads, or to begin filming, if they have access to the technology and are ready to begin recording the documentary.

For Lighter Support

- Before the end of class, allow time for students to partner with classmates who need heavier support to review their pitch, making recommendations on pronunciation and emphasis, so that their classmates can practice their presentations properly and with confidence for homework. Modeling for others gives students confidence for their own presentations.

For Heavier Support

- Before the end of class, allow time for students to partner with classmates who need lighter support to review their pitch to ensure they know how to pronounce and emphasize the words in their part of the pitch. Doing so prepares students to properly and confidently practice their presentations for homework.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
