SL.7.4, SL.7.5, SL.7.6

(Example for Teacher Reference)

In this lesson, you will practice making your “pitch” for your documentary clip. A pitch is a kind of presentation that filmmakers and other artists make to people to excite them about their project or convince them to help with making it. What are some of the elements you think will be important to include in your pitch? Why?

Answers will vary, but may include: It will be important to include an explanation of the documentary clip we plan on making in our pitch, so our audience understands what kind of clip we are planning. It will also be important to include and explain the storyboard so the audience will have an understanding of what the documentary will look like. Finally, it will be important to present this information in an exciting way so that the audience will also be excited about the idea.
