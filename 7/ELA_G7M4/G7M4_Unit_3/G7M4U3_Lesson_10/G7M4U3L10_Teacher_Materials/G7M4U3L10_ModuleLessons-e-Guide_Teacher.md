Model Documentary Clip Pitch Guide

SL.7.4, SL.7.5, SL.7.6

(For Teacher Reference)

**Note to Teacher:** Use this guide to model a documentary clip pitch. Each part is meant to be given by one member of a student triad. Indicate this before modeling the part.

**Part 1: Overview of the clip and explanation of why you are making it**

Ladies and gentlemen, I am excited to present to you my idea for a documentary clip about the problem of plastic pollution. Many of you may be aware that plastic pollution is the problem, but did you know how big this problem is? According to Jessica Hullinger of *The Week* magazine, “as much as 8 million metric tons of plastic found its way to the ocean in 2010.” How do we get more people to care about plastic pollution? The power of a story. We need to tell the story of plastic pollution in an interesting and personal way. That way, people will become interested and hopeful that they too can help solve the problem. That is exactly what I plan on doing with my documentary clip, called “Lunch, Hold the Plastic.”

**Part 2: Description of some of the key scenes, using the storyboard as reference**

***Note for teacher:** Present relevant parts of the storyboard and gesture to them along with the presentation notes below. Panel numbers in parentheses relate to presentation notes.*

(Panels 1–3): I’ve brought my storyboard with me to show you some of the ideas for the clip. As you can see, we start with a scene of a plastic bag caught on a branch in the river, in one of my favorite swimming spots. I will go there and film the river. This place is beautiful and seeing a plastic bag there inspires me to take action.

(Panels 4–6): The next scene will show all the plastic pollution piling up around the world, as I realize that what I am seeing in my river is just one part of a larger problem. According to the documentary *A Plastic Ocean*, “80 million tons of waste in the U.S. alone, every year, comes from plastic food packaging.” The images also show animals around the world being affected by plastic pollution. I will get these images from the internet to show how widespread the problem is.

(Panels 7–9): Then we will cut to an interview I did with the owner of the local restaurant. Here you see the drawings I made to plan out this interview. Since I don’t know exactly how it will look or what will be said, I have these drawings and wrote what I think will be said in the interview.

**Part 3: A closing statement reiterating the importance of making the documentary clip**

As you can see, I have a solid plan for my documentary. I’ve included my ideas for what I will say and the images I will need. For the concluding part of the documentary, I will show the effects of cleaning up plastic by using images of clean beaches and the river without plastic. I will remind viewers that they are part of a larger movement. According to Danielle Smith-Llera in her book *Trash Vortex*, “Every day people fight the war on plastic pollution.” I will get the images from the internet and from filming them myself. Using all this material, I am going to create a strong documentary clip that will help convey the problem and solutions for plastic pollution to a wider audience.
