Monday, May 20: Today, I used a reusable water bottle instead of the two disposable water bottles I usually use. At lunch, I asked the school cafeteria workers if there were reusable cutlery and plates, but there aren’t, so I saved and washed my plastic cutlery and Styrofoam plate from lunch, so I can reuse it tomorrow.
