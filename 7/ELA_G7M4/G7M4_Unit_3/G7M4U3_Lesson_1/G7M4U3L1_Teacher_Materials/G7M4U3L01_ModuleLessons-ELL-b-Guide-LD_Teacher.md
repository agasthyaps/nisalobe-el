5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

SL.7.2, L.7.1a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

**It is clear** that the choices we make as individuals have an impact on plastic pollution. (from paragraph 2 of Model Documentary Script: “Lunch, Hold the Plastic”)

**Lesson 1 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after students analyze the model documentary script in Work Time B.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target (**I can determine the purpose and content of an effective documentary script about plastic pollution**) and SL.7.2 by providing an idea that clarifies evidence to support a main claim in a documentary script.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses declarative language (**It is clear**) followed by a that-clause with the purpose of clarifying evidence to support a main claim.

- Transfer: **It is clear + that** clause to clarify ideas and evidence to support a main claim when writing a documentary script in the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment.

**Key**

Underline

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **<u>It is clear</u> that the choices we make as individuals have an impact on plastic pollution.**

- Ask:

“What is the central idea of this sentence?” (Answers will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all answers.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **It is clear**

- Underline clear in yellow, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 

- Ask:

“Can you give examples of items, structures, or materials in the world around us that are clear?” (Answers will vary, but help students to consider the transparency of water, windows, and glass bottles.)

“Why do you think the writer uses it is clear at the beginning of this sentence to introduce an idea?” (Answers will vary, but look for students to identify that a clear idea is one that is easy to see or understand. As needed, draw an explicit comparison between water and glass and clear ideas to help illustrate the concept of something being obvious or easy to perceive.)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **<u>It is clear</u> that the choices we make as individuals have an impact on plastic pollution.**

- Ask:

“What do you notice about the language structure of the information that follows it is clear? Is it a phrase or a clause? How do you know?” (It is a clause that begins with that. We know this because it has a subject and a verb.)

- Invite students to review paragraph 2 of the model podcast to answer the questions below.

“What choice about plastic is the writer referring to? How do you know?” (The choice to consume food with plastic wrappers. Look for students to cite examples of sentences in the paragraph that mention food packaging or food containers.)

“What evidence does the writer provide about the impact of this choice?” (80 million tons of waste in the United States alone, every year, comes from plastic food packaging; 1 million plastic bags \[are\] used every minute; plastic food packaging represents the majority of municipal waste.)

“How can we use it is clear followed by a that-clause in our own speaking and writing?” (To explain what we can conclude from evidence provided to support a claim.)

- Ask:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Answers will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target:  
I can determine the purpose and content of an effective documentary script about plastic pollution?” (Answers will vary.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

**It is clear \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

**that** clause

(**that** + subject + verb + \[object\] = **that** clause)

- Say:

“Use this frame to write a sentence for your documentary script in your own words with your partners.”

- Answers will vary, but may include:

**It is clear <u>that we can reduce plastic consumption with some small actions</u>**.

**that** clause

> (**that** + subject + verb + \[object\] = **that** clause)
