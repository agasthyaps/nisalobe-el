Personal Decision

give up plastic straws for a week

Individual Contributions to the Action Plan

Each of us is going to refuse to use a certain kind of plastic for a week and document how much plastic we saved from going to waste.

How We Will Combine Our Actions for the Documentary

Since we are all refusing different kinds of plastic, we can include brief examples from each of our actions in the script. This way, we can show the effects of refusing to use different kinds of plastic.

Questions and Comments

Do we all need to refuse to use the same kind of plastic? How will we measure the impact of our decision to not use plastic?
