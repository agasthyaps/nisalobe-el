Where and how does plastic pollute?

- *Plastic pollutes our world (especially our oceans) when people dispose of it incorrectly.*

- *Plastic pollution travels from land to the ocean and is taken by the currents in a big vortex called the North Pacific Gyre.*

- *Animals and people are being harmed by plastic pollution.*

- *Plastic entered our world in the 1950s, and, through marketing and lifestyle, has become ubiquitous.*

What can be done about plastic pollution? What is being done? What can I do?

- *There are three main points in the life cycle of plastic: the beginning (making plastic), the middle (buying and using plastic), the end (disposing of plastic).*

- *People try to combat plastic pollution with different solutions at these three points in the plastic life cycle.*

- *People who combat plastic pollution use their skills and learning to help others and to improve their environment and our world.*

What will your student be doing at school?

In the first half of Unit 3, students delve deeper into how to respond to plastic pollution, as a continuation of their research in Unit 2. Students choose a personal action to respond to the issue of plastic pollution, for example, a personal decision to use less plastic or recycle more, communicate with officials, research an invention, or some other idea. They will form triads with classmates who have chosen the same category of action plan, and together they will determine how their personal actions can coordinate to be used in their documentary film clip.

Each homework practice includes the opportunity to enact this personal action and take notes on it. Then each lesson includes in-class time to discuss the results of the action plan and to further enact it through research or other efforts. In addition to this action plan work, students work in class to write their documentary script over the course of the first half of the unit. First they review a model documentary script, determining the characteristics of a strong narrative lead or opening. Then each member of their triad practices these narrative writing skills by creating a lead to their documentary script. Then triads work together to choose, revise, or combine their narrative drafts into one lead for their documentary script, focusing on eliminating repetition and wordiness. Students then divide the remaining three sections of their documentary script among their triad, so that each student writes either the argument, action plan description, or conclusion. Before the mid-unit assessment, students share their sections of the script with each other to make suggestions on how they can improve the content of the script. Triads focus on presenting their research findings (including descriptions, facts, details, and examples) in a focused and clear way. For the mid-unit assessment, students demonstrate their revision skills, using their peers’ suggestions from the previous lesson to improve their section of the script.

In the second half of Unit 3, students work in their triads to create a storyboard, using visuals to clarify their claims and findings as well as to emphasize the points in their documentary script. They then learn how to pitch, or present, their documentary to imaginary film producers observing a model pitch. Then students practice and give each other feedback on their presentation skills such as using appropriate eye contact, adequate volume, and clear pronunciation. Finally, in the end of unit assessment, students work in triads to each pitch a part of their documentary script, focusing on their use of formal English, domain-specific vocabulary, and visuals in their storyboard as well as their presentation skills.

Central to the EL Education curriculum is a focus on “habits of character” and social-emotional learning. Students work to become effective learners, developing mindsets and skills for success in college, career, and life (e.g., initiative, responsibility, perseverance, collaboration); work to become ethical people, treating others well and standing up for what is right (e.g., empathy, integrity, respect, compassion); and work to contribute to a better world, putting their learning to use to improve communities (e.g., citizenship, service).

In this unit, students focus on working to become effective learners as they collaborate, persevere, and take responsibility and initiative to enact an action plan, create a documentary script and storyboard, present their documentary pitch, and film and edit their documentary. Students also focus on working to become ethical people as they practice compassion and respect listening to one another’s work. Additionally, students work on contributing to a better world by using their strengths to help others grow, informing others about the problem of plastic pollution and the steps they can take to help reduce pollution, as well as presenting their knowledge for the class, the school, the community, and even the world.

How can you support your student at home?

Notice plastic waste in your home and plastic pollution in your neighborhood. Visit local waterways and/or storm drains to find signs of plastic pollution.

Explore with your student issues around plastic pollution. Read articles, nonfiction texts, and watch documentary films related to plastic pollution at various points during the plastic life cycle:

- Beginning: Finding alternatives to plastic

- Middle: Recycling or reusing plastic

- End: Cleaning up plastic pollution

You may use questions such as the following for your conversations:

- How do the techniques (images, camera techniques, voiceovers, interviews, graphics, statistics, and text) in documentary films add to the impact of storytelling and develop claims?

- What are the central ideas in the text or documentary film?

- What do you think should be done about the problem of plastic pollution?

- How can we help with the problem of plastic pollution in our own house, neighborhood, or community?

Unit 3: Homework

In Lessons 1–7, students work on their personal action plans. They research a solution to plastic pollution, write letters to a government official or agency, or carry out a personal action. Students record their plans, research, and actions they’ve taken in their Action Plan Journal.

In Lessons 6–7, students reflect on their improvement over the course of the writing process from planning to writing to revision. Students also set goals for future writing.

In Lessons 8–9, students have the option of working on their storyboards.

In Lesson 10, students practice their documentary clip pitch, focusing on the part of the pitch they are responsible for in their triads.

In Lessons 10–12, students may begin filming scenes for their documentary clip.

In Lessons 11–12, students reflect on their presentation, asking themselves, “What worked well? How would I like to improve next time?”

In Lessons 13–14, students may publish their documentary clip based on school policy and teacher guidance and recommendations for family, friends, and/or social media.

In Lessons 4–5 and 8–10, students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their independent reading journal.

Independent Research Reading: When not reading the anchor text, your student is expected to independently research the topic by reading topic-related books of his or her choice for approximately 20 minutes each day and responding to a prompt of choice in the front of the independent reading journal. These are usually books your student will bring home from school; however, they may be topic-related books chosen by the student at the public or your home library. Prompts for independent reading can be found in the homework materials provided below.

Independent Reading

**Directions:** Remember to record responses to research reading in the front of your independent reading journal and responses to choice reading in the back. Try to choose a different prompt each time.

Record any new vocabulary in your vocabulary log. Underline vocabulary found during independent reading.

**Record:**

- Date

- Title and author of your reading book

- Pages you have read

- Prompt

- Response

**Example:**

<u>Date:</u> 03/01/19

<u>Book Title and Author:</u> *Trash Vortex* by Danielle Smith-Llera

<u>Pages Read:</u> 26–37

<u>Prompt:</u> What is the author’s point of view in the text? How does the author distinguish his or her position from that of others?

<u>Response:</u> The author’s point of view is that plastic is a huge problem. In this chapter, she distinguishes her own point of view from the point of view of most Americans in the 1950s and 1960s, which was that plastic is useful, beneficial, and disposable.

**Consider using the following independent reading prompts.**[^1]

- What are the central ideas in the text and how are they developed?

- What is the author’s purpose and how is it developed?

- What is the author’s point of view in the text? How does the author distinguish his or her position from that of others?

- Where and how does plastic pollute?

- What can be done about plastic pollution? What is being done about plastic pollution?

- Choose one new word from your reading today and analyze it on a vocabulary square.

| **Definition in your own words**                  | **Synonyms** (words with the same meaning) |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Words with the same affix or root**             | **Sketch**                                 |
| **Translation in home language** (if appropriate) |                                            |

Vocabulary

**Directions:** In the classroom, you have been recording words from your texts in your vocabulary log. Throughout this unit, you have been research reading topic-related books at home to build your knowledge of plastic pollution and recording words in your independent reading journal.

Choose a word from your research reading or from a text you’ve read in class and add the word to your vocabulary log. Try to choose a different word to add and to practice a different vocabulary strategy each time. For each word, be sure to add the following:

1.  The definition, or meaning, of the word

<!-- -->

10. The vocabulary strategy you used to figure out the meaning of the word

11. A sketch or diagram that helps you to better understand the meaning of the word

Record new vocabulary in vocabulary logs and mark academic vocabulary with a symbol, for example, a star:

- Academic vocabulary: words you might find in informational texts on many different topics. For example, the words **evidence** and **rationale** are words that could be found in books on any topic.

- Domain-specific vocabulary: words about a particular topic. For example, the words **tadpoles**, **frogspawn**, and **amphibian** are some that would be found on the topic of frogs.

**Vocabulary Strategies**

As a reminder, the vocabulary strategies we’ve been working on in class are listed below:

- Context: Read the sentence around the word.

- Look at the affixes for clues.

- Look at the root of the word for clues.

- Use a dictionary.

- Discuss the word with another person (after attempting some of the above strategies).

[^1]: Some of the prompts will not be appropriate for the text students are reading. Invite students to choose a prompt that works for the text they have just read.
