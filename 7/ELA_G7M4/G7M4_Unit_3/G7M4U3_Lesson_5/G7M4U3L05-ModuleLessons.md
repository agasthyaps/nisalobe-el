Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- SL.7.1 – Opening A: On an entrance ticket, students consider the character traits and academic mindsets required to develop and strengthen writing.

- W.7.4 – Work Time A: Students work collaboratively to strengthen their documentary script writing by focusing on how well purpose and audience have been addressed.

- W.7.5 – Work Time A: Students work collaboratively to strengthen their documentary script writing by planning and collaborating as they discuss their action plan.

- SL.7.4 – Closing and Assessment A: Students collaborate to combine and revise their documentary scripts, focusing on presenting their claims, findings, descriptions, facts, and details in a coherent manner.

- In this lesson, students focus on becoming effective learners as they collaborate with partners to combine and revise their documentary scripts. They also work on contributing to a better world by using their strengths to help others grow as they strengthen their documentary script.

- The Think-Pair-Share protocol is used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- If homework is not an option for students and they didn’t finish their documentary script in the previous lesson, then in Closing and Assessment A of this lesson they can work with their triad to finish their script.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Release more responsibility more quickly to students as they comprehend the tasks or concepts. For example:

- If students finish combining and revising and practicing their script, encourage them to partner with other groups to help them revise their scripts.

- If students are not sure how to link scenes in the script using transition phrases, invite students who are skilled with transition phrases to coach others.

- Invite students who are skilled leaders to coach others on how to have a productive, efficient collaborative work session.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students have focused on writing sections of their documentary scripts independently. In this lesson, they work together to combine their sections into a single script.

Support All Students

- Students may need additional support engaging in a productive conversation about the script with peers. Model a productive exchange and providing sentence starters as well as the narrative, informational, and argumentative checklists for groups who may need extra support. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson provides students with the opportunity to collaborate on combining and revising their documentary script. This extensive collaboration in each activity ensures comprehension of and success on the tasks throughout the lesson.

- ELLs may find it challenging to present their work to others. Ensure students who are most reluctant to share are in supportive groups and that their classmates are instructed to show empathy and compassion as they share.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, 7.I.C.10, 7.I.C.12, 7.II.B.5, 7.II.C.6, and 7.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- Monitor students’ combined scripts to ensure that they understand the expectations for the final scripts.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will engage in a Tuning protocol to give and receive feedback on their documentary script. Then they will work independently to revise their script for the mid-unit assessment.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – SL.7.1 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 5**.

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, ask for volunteers to share their responses to the prompts.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

- Students may be overwhelmed by the amount of text on the entrance ticket. Before reading, ask students to draw on their previous experience to Think-Pair-Share about what they recall about the habits of character they have learned and practiced throughout the year. Then allow extra time for students to read and respond to the entrance ticket prompts.

For Heavier Support

- See For Lighter Support. Additionally, allow students who require heavier supports to read and respond to the entrance ticket in pairs. As necessary, draw together a small group of students to read aloud the entrance ticket and model responding to the prompt by circling one or two habits of character.

Work Time

A. Triad Action Plan – W.7.4, W.7.5 (20 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can collaborate with my group to strengthen our documentary script, focusing on how well purpose and audience have been addressed.”

- Remind students that their progress on the action plan directly impacts their progress on the documentary script.

- Distribute **sticky dots or stickers** to each student. Invite students to place their sticky dot or sticker in the correct place on the **Action Plan Progress anchor chart**.

- Ask students to join with their documentary triads to discuss their action plans. Post the following prompts (also found on the Action Plan Progress anchor chart), and ask students to discuss them in their triads:

“Share with your triad where you placed your sticker on the Action Plan Progress anchor chart.”

“Given that there are two more days of homework on this assignment, discuss whether or not you are behind schedule, on schedule, or ahead of schedule.”

“What strategies do you have for completing the steps in your action plan if you are behind schedule?”

“What ideas do you have for extending the work of your action plan if you are ahead of schedule?”

“What final work do you plan on doing on your action plan tonight?”

- Invite students to reflect on the learning target and habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- To ensure students are making progress on their triad action plan, ask them to join with another triad to share what they have done and what they still plan to do in this lesson. Include a brief class sharing to build in accountability and modeling for all students.

For Heavier Support

- See For Lighter Support. Additionally, for students who require heavier supports, provide the following sentence frames:

- For our action plan we have . . .

- We still need to . . .

- Today we will . . .

- Include a brief class sharing to build in accountability and modeling for all students.

Closing and Assessment

A. Combine and Revise Documentary Script – SL.7.4 (20 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can collaborate with my group to strengthen our documentary script, focusing on how well purpose and audience have been addressed.”

“I can choose language that expresses ideas precisely and concisely, recognizing and eliminating wordiness and redundancy.”

- Inform students they will combine and revise their parts of the documentary script, focusing on the content and language of the scripts. Tell students that today’s lesson will provide an opportunity to think more deeply about how listeners will understand the information in their script.

- Ask:

“What are some of the ways we might revise a piece of writing if we intend for people to hear it in a documentary film, instead of reading it?” (Responses will vary, but may include: We should think about how people only get to hear things once, usually, and so we should focus on making the sentences simpler and clearer where we can. We should revise our writing to emphasize certain words or sentences when we speak. We know that we can’t script everything, as some parts will depend on interviews and interactions with others. Also, we can think about how images and action sequences can add to our script.)

- Display and distribute the **Presentation checklist**. Inform students that as they combine their scripts today, they will use the first three rows of this checklist. Read aloud the first three rows. Then ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“How will the first three criteria on the Presentation checklist help you make decisions about the content and language of your presentation?” (The Presentation checklist focuses on “emphasizing salient points” and presenting findings in a “focused and coherent” way, which helps remind us to really focus on emphasizing what is most important in a spoken presentation.)

- Explain that the Presentation checklist will help students refine the content and language of their written scripts to make them effective when read aloud.

- Allow several minutes for students to generate criteria for the third column of the first three rows of the Presentation checklist based on this discussion. Students can work independently or in triads. Circulate to identify any criteria to review as a class, using the **Presentation checklist (example for teacher reference)** for sample criteria as necessary.

- Invite students to join with their triads and retrieve their **narrative lead and documentary script section** to begin combining and making revisions to their scripts, focusing on transitions between sections; using clear, concise language to present findings about plastic pollution and highlight important points; and including pertinent facts, details, and examples in each section. Students should retrieve their **action plan journal** and **Documentary Script planner** to make sure they have included all the important claims, facts, details, and examples in all the sections of their documentary script. They may need to consult the **texts from Module 4** to add facts, details, or examples.

- Circulate to support students as they work. Ask questions to guide their thinking:

“What are the key findings you want to include about plastic pollution?” (For students who need more support, ask, “What did you learn about the plastic pollution? Where did you include that information in your script?” ▲)

“Do you present your findings in a focused and coherent manner?” (For students who need more support, ask, “Do you tell the events of the action plan in order? Do you use transition words between paragraphs and sections?” ▲)

“Do you emphasize salient points?” (For students who need more support, ask, “Do you have an exciting hook or opening? Do you end with a message and reflection on plastic pollution?” ▲)

“Do you use descriptions, facts, details, and examples to help the reader understand your action plan and the problem of plastic pollution?” (For students who need more support, ask, “Do you include dialogue and description to make some events seem exciting?” ▲)

“What is the purpose of the documentary film?” (To convince others to take action to stop plastic pollution.)

“How and where did you address purpose in the documentary film script?” (Responses will vary.)

“Who is the audience for our documentary film script?” (Responses will vary.)

“How and where did you address audience in the documentary film script?” (Responses will vary.)

- Invite students to record *Y* for *yes* and the date in the final column of their Presentation checklist if they feel they have achieved the criteria marked on their checklist in their writing in this lesson.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- In Closing and Assessment A, as students revise their section of their documentary script, challenge them to include at least one modifying phrase and one set of coordinate adjectives. At the end of the lesson, students can share their examples with their triad.

For Heavier Support

- In Closing and Assessment A, students may be reluctant to share their section of the documentary script with their triad. If time allows, work with students to edit their section to ensure they feel comfortable sharing their work.

Homework

A. Action Plan

- Students continue to work on their personal action plans. Students record their plans, research, and actions they’ve taken in their action plan journals, including at least one new note in the final research or results section.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.

For Lighter Support

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from the Model Documentary Script. Provide ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Invite students to predict some of the questions that the Language Dive may ask. This will improve students’ metacognition and challenge their awareness of the most interesting or meaningful elements of the sentence.

For Heavier Support

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from the Model Documentary Script. Provide ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Encourage students to independently reflect on this sentence and its meaning before the next lesson. Students may also wish to use dictionaries to add any unknown vocabulary and meanings to their vocabulary logs.
