Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- SL.7.4 – Opening A: Students consider the following aspects of a strong presentation: clear and valid claims and findings, salient points, focus, coherency, pertinent descriptions, facts, details, examples, eye contact, adequate volume, and clear pronunciation.

- SL.7.4 – Work Time A: Students practice their documentary clip pitch, focusing on presenting in a coherent manner, emphasizing salient points, and using adequate volume and clear pronunciation.

- SL.7.4 – Closing and Assessment A: Students self-assess their skills of presenting in a coherent manner, emphasizing salient points, and using adequate volume and clear pronunciation.

- For the End of Unit 3 Assessment, students present their documentary pitch focusing on presenting in a coherent manner, emphasizing salient points, and using adequate volume and clear pronunciation. (SL.7.4) Students use their storyboard to emphasize salient points. (SL.7.5) They also adapt their speech for the presentation, using formal English when appropriate. (SL.7.6)

- In this lesson, students focus on working to contribute to a better world by presenting their knowledge for the class.

- Two lessons have been allocated for this assessment to ensure sufficient time for students to make their presentations. If these are taught in two separate lessons rather than together as one block, revisit the learning targets and the task at the beginning of the second 45-minute lesson to remind students of the task and purpose.

- If the class completes their presentations early, triads can begin to work on filming their documentary clip scenes.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Allow those students who are confident public speakers to coach students who are less confident with tips and strategies. If necessary, allow time before the presentations for these students to coach others. Also, ask these expert students to present first to model strong presentation skills.

- Teach presentation strategies, or allow students with knowledge in this arena to teach presentation strategies such as mindfulness, breathing techniques, and group initiatives to build collaboration and crew within presentation groups before the assessment.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students have focused on creating a storyboard and on practicing and improving their presentation skills. In this lesson, students are assessed on their presentation skills as they pitch their documentary film clip.

Support All Students

- The subject matter of the exhibit presentations may include descriptions of plastic pollution and harm to humans, animals, wildlife, and the environment. Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of the presentations needs to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually. To support students in processing this content, ask: “What habit of character did you use as you listened to presentations and presented?” Students may need to draw on perseverance, empathy, or compassion as they listen to this content, being sensitive to their own and others’ reactions to the information presented.

- Students may need additional support to have the courage to present in front of their peers. Provide strategies such as calming breathing techniques, positive visualization techniques, and discussion of crew support. Consider alternatives such as presenting in small groups or one-on-one while other students are engaged in other activities. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson consists of tasks students have practiced in the previous lesson as well as in previous modules. This gradual release supports students in independent achievement on this assessment.

- ELLs may find it challenging to give a presentation for an assessment. Assure students that skills like volume, pacing, clarity, and emphasis are not contingent on language acquisition abilities. In other words, students can succeed at these skills even if they are newcomers or beginners.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, and 7.I.C.10.

Assessment Guidance

- Assessment materials (Presentation Rubric) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources. When assessing and providing feedback to students on this assessment, use the students’ recorded presentations and the Presentation Rubric; or, if preferred, use the Presentation checklist from Module 3, Lesson 5, Closing and Assessment A.

Down the Road

- In the next lessons, students will complete their documentary film clip and invite the community to attend their Documentary Film Clip screening, if feasible.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – SL.7.4 (10 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions **on Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lessons 11–12**. Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique to review sample responses.

- Return the **Module 3 Mid-Unit Assessments with feedback**, and allow students time to review feedback and write their name on the board if they require support. Invite students to Turn and Talk, or, if they’d prefer, write stars and steps from their assessment.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Practice Documentary Clip Pitch – SL.7.4 (10 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can present my documentary pitch in a formal, focused, and clear way, emphasizing important points.”

“I can use appropriate eye contact, adequate volume, and clear pronunciation to present.”

“I can use visual displays in my storyboard to clarify and emphasize points.”

- Inform students that over the course of the next two lessons, they will complete an end of unit assessment by pitching their documentary clip. Remind students of their work in Lesson 10, planning the pitch and practicing their presentation skills.

- Ask students to form triads and work for several minutes using their **Documentary Pitch note-catcher** to review their documentary pitch, including those who will present each part, what they will say, and how they will use the storyboard to emphasize their points.

- Circulate to ensure students are taking notes and planning their pitch. Remind students that they do not need to write out every word they will say, but should use notes to help them remember the important parts of their talk to get their classmates excited about their documentary clip. For sample notes, see the **Documentary Pitch note-catcher (example for reference)**.

- After several minutes, transition triads from planning their pitch to practicing it. Circulate to support students in taking turns to present different parts of the pitch and ensuring that they divide the work evenly. Remind students that each should deliver a part of the documentary pitch and that their part must meet all the criteria for an effective presentation in their section, including presenting claims and findings, emphasizing points, and including descriptions, facts, details, and examples.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

- Ask students to retrieve their copies of the **Presentation checklist**, Documentary Clip Pitch note-catcher, and their **documentary script** and **storyboard**.

For Lighter Support

- For the end of unit assessment presentation, students may feel more comfortable reading a scripted pitch rather than speaking from notes. If so, encourage them to draft and practice their scripted pitch during Work Time A.

Work Time

B. End-of-Unit 3 Assessment: Pitch a Documentary Clip (45 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can present my documentary pitch in a formal, focused, and clear way, emphasizing important points.”

“I can use appropriate eye contact, adequate volume, and clear pronunciation to present.”

“I can use visual displays in my storyboard to clarify and emphasize points.”

- Inform students that they will now complete an end of unit assessment by presenting their documentary clip pitch.

- Ask students to remain in their triads with their Presentation checklist, Documentary Pitch note-catcher, **script**, and **storyboard**. Distribute the **End of Unit 3 Assessment: Pitch a Documentary Clip**.

- Read aloud the assessment while students follow along. Answer clarifying questions.

- Before students begin to present, incorporate reflection on and awareness of the following academic mindsets: “This work has value for me,” “I can succeed at this,” and “My ability and competence grow with my effort.”

“What value does a presentation task have for you beyond this class? Why?” (Answers will vary but may include: This task has a lot of value for me because I will continue to make presentations in most of my high school and college classes, and in my work life as well.)

“What will help you succeed on this assessment?” (Answers will vary but may include: Improving my performance based on the feedback and revisions gained from the Tuning protocol will help me do well on this assessment. Taking a deep breath and calming myself down before I begin speaking will also help.)

“How has your ability and competence grown with your effort?” (Answers will vary but may include: As I responded to feedback, my presentation improved. I worked really hard to make it better, and it shows.)

- Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart** and the **Work to Contribute to a Better World anchor chart**. Review perseverance and improving communities. Remind students that because they will be challenging themselves with a presentation, they will need to persevere. Review “I apply my learning to help our school, the community, and the environment.” Remind students that because they will eventually present their documentary clip to the community, they will share it with a wider audience than this classroom, which will contribute to a better world.

- Invite student triads to begin the assessment. Use a **device** to record each presentation. Use the recording to assess presentation skills on the **Presentation Rubric**. For large classes, consider conducting independent research reading during the presentations, so students can work quietly while other students make their presentations for assessment.

- Remind students who are not presenting to remain silent so the presenters can focus and do their very best work.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Heavier Support

- In the end of unit assessment in Work Time B, students may be better supported in delivering their presentation to a small group of supportive students rather than the whole class. If so, make arrangements for other students to continue practicing their presentations or reading their independent research reading text as a smaller group of students listen to presentations.

Closing and Assessment

A. Self-Assess – SL.7.4 (10 minutes)

- Inform students that they will self-assess themselves on the following learning targets:

“I can present my documentary pitch in a formal, focused, and clear way, emphasizing important points.”

“I can use appropriate eye contact, adequate volume, and clear pronunciation to present.”

“I can use visual displays in my storyboard to clarify and emphasize points.”

- Draw students’ attention to the **Presentation Self-Assessment anchor chart**. Distribute **three sticky dots or stickers** per student. Discuss the terms *exemplary*, *grade-level mastery*, *learning*, and *foundational* with students, ensuring comprehension of the vocabulary. Invite students to come to the anchor chart and place their sticky dot in the correct spot—exemplary, grade-level mastery, learning, or foundational. Remind students that this work involves integrity to honestly place the sticker in the correct spot for their mastery level. Invite students to share why they placed their stickers in a particular spot as a whole group, with a partner, or in writing.

For Lighter Support

- At the end of the lesson, encourage students to take a few moments to reflect on their learning. Use the following questions to prompt reflection:

- What have you learned about plastic pollution? about different solutions and points of the plastic life cycle? About documentary film creation?

- What new vocabulary or language structures did you learn in this unit?

- Encourage students to share the most important or exciting thing they learned in this unit. Reflecting on learning allows students to more firmly grasp abstract concepts and gives them confidence and ownership over their own learning.

Closing and Assessment

B. Independent Research Reading Share – RI.7.10 (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to guide students to share their independent research reading, reminding students that the purpose of research reading is to build their content knowledge, domain-specific vocabulary, and achievement on reading complex texts.

- Refer to the **Independent Reading Sample Plans** to guide students through a research reading share, or use another routine.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- During Closing and Assessment B, students share with a partner their independent research reading book. Sharing about their book will ensure students are engaged with the book and give them an opportunity to find a different one if they are no longer interested in their choice. As necessary, review the purpose of independent research reading. Emphasize the benefits of reading multiple texts on the same topic (e.g., repeated exposure to relevant vocabulary).

Homework

A. Optional: Begin Filming

- If students have the technology to film (with a phone or other device), they can begin filming scenes for their documentary clip.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
