5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

W.7.3, L.7.1b

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

I always did my best to recycle, **but couldn’t I do more to stop plastic pollution?** (from paragraph 1 of Model Documentary Script: “Lunch, Hold the Plastic”)

**Lesson 2 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after students analyze the narrative lead in the model documentary script in Work Time A.

Rationale

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target (**I can determine criteria for an effective narrative lead in a documentary**) and W.7.3 by using a question as a technique for capturing the listener’s interest with a call to action in the narrative lead of a documentary. The sentence also helps to address L.7.1b because it is a compound sentence that uses **but** to signal contrast between ideas.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses a compound sentence in the form of a question to introduce a contrasting idea with the purpose of capturing the audience’s attention.

- Transfer: independent clause + **but** + independent clause + **?** to capture an audience’s attention when writing a documentary script in the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **I always did my best to recycle, <u>but couldn’t I do more to stop plastic pollution?</u>**

- Ask:

“What is this sentence about?” (Answers may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **but couldn’t I do more to stop plastic pollution?**

- Ask:

“What do you notice about the language structure of this chunk?” (Answers will vary, but look for students to identify that this is a question and that it begins with the coordinating conjunction but.)

“What is the writer wondering?” (If she could take more action to stop the pollution caused by plastic.)

“Who is the writer asking this question to?” (The listener, but also herself.)

“Can you figure out why the writer would include a question in the narrative lead of her documentary script?” (To show the thinking behind her actions in a way that captures the audience’s attention with a call to action.)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **I always did my best to recycle, <u>but couldn’t I do more to stop plastic pollution?</u>**

- Ask:

“Is this a simple, compound, or complex sentence? How do you know?” (Compound. It contains two independent clauses connected by a coordinating conjunction, but.)

“Can you figure out why the writer uses but to connect the two independent clauses in this sentence?” (To indicate that the two ideas presented contrast each other. The writer’s actions show that she is committed to stopping plastic pollution, but she still wants to do more, which might be surprising or unexpected.)

“What if we replace but with and?” (The meaning of the sentence changes, and the contrast relationship between the writer’s previous actions and thoughts isn’t clear.)

“What if we rewrite the second independent clause as a statement rather than a question?” (The clause would be written as, “I could do more to stop plastic pollution.” The sentence would still make sense, but it would be less interesting and engaging for the audience.)

“How can you use compound sentences that contain but to show contrast between a statement and a question in our own speaking and writing?” (Answers will vary, but look for students to recognize that they can use this structure as a technique for capturing an audience’s attention in the narrative lead of their documentary.)

- Ask:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Answers will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target:  
I can determine criteria for an effective narrative lead in a documentary”? (Answers  
will vary.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, but \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?**

independent clause (statement) independent clause (question)

- Say:

“Use this frame to write a sentence that captures the audience’s attention with a call to action in the narrative lead of your documentary.”

- Answers will vary, but may include:

**<u>We care about the earth and our environment</u>**, **but**

independent clause (statement)

**<u>are we doing enough to stop plastic pollution</u>**?

independent clause (question)
