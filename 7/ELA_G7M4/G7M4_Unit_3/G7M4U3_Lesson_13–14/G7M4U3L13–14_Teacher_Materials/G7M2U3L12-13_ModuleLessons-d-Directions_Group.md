Chalk Talk Directions and Norms

SL.7.5

**Directions for the Chalk Talk:**

1.  Each student individually moves through the stations with a different-colored pencil, marker, or pen and several sticky notes. If classroom supplies are limited in this regard, consider having students sign their name by their comments.

1.  Students choose a station, move to that station, and read/listen to/view the text. If three students are already at that station, then students make another choice and move to a different station.

2.  Each student writes on the chart paper of that station, responding to at least one question.

3.  Because this is a Celebration of Learning, students provide positive, celebratory feedback.

4.  Once finished reading/listening/viewing and commenting, students move silently to another station.

5.  Students read/listen to/view the new text and comment once again, repeating this step as many times as possible in the time allotted.

6.  When others have written comments on chart paper, students search for patterns and themes. Students jot down these noticings on a sticky note or put a star by a comment they’ve seen more than once. Students should be prepared to share patterns and themes.

7.  At the conclusion of the Chalk Talk, students share patterns and themes aloud with the whole class.
