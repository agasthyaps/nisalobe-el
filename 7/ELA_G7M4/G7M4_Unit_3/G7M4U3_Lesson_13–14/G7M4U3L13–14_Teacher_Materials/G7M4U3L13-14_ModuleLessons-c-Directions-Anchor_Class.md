How to Edit Film Anchor Chart

SL.7.5

Be aware that these steps may vary depending on the editing software used.

1.  Upload the video clips of your film. The film becomes the main track. Text, statistics, images, voice-overs, graphics, and music will then be layered above or below the main track.

2.  Add text, statistics, images, voice-overs, graphics, and music by uploading, recording, or selecting them from the program.

3.  Watch the film and insert the text, statistics, images, voice-overs, graphics, or music clip where they belong in your script. Drag and drop clips and/or shorten them as needed. Adjust the volume of the clip as needed, making sure that listeners can hear the voices of people speaking above the music.

4.  For text, statistics, images, voice-overs, graphics, or musical interludes, upload the film in pieces. Then add the text, statistics, images, voice-overs, graphics, or music in between the pieces.

5.  Create a title page and credits page for the film. Include the names of all students who worked on the clip and what job they performed.
