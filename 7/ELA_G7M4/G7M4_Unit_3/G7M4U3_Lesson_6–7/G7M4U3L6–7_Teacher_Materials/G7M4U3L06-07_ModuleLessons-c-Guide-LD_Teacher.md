Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- **According to**

“What do you think according to means? Can you figure out why the author starts this sentence with the phrase according to?” (According to means as shown by something or stated by someone. The author starts with this phrase to signal that the following information is shown or stated by something or someone else, rather than by the author of this documentary script.)

- **the documentary *A Plastic Ocean***

“What or who is the following information shown or stated by?” (The documentary  
A Plastic Ocean.)

- Invite students to read the previous two sentences in this paragraph (“Where does all this plastic come from? There are many forms of plastic pollution, but let’s just focus on the kind I was carrying to the river with me that day”) and then discuss in pairs what information they think this sentence will share. (Answers will vary, but may include: information about where plastic pollution comes from.)

- Then, students can switch partners and discuss why they think the author wanted to share information stated by others, rather than just sharing their own opinion. (Answers will vary, but may include that sharing facts is essential to building a strong argument, and that sharing research and findings from others is an important way to do this.)

- **Students can use Conversation Cues as they discuss. To provide heavier support, display a suggested sequence, such as the one below:**

- Why do you think that? (Goal 1)

- Can you say more about that? (Goal 1)

- **in the U.S. alone**

“What waste is this chunk telling us about?” (The waste is made in the U.S. alone. The word alone is used to emphasize that there is more waste in the world than  
80 million tons, but that this sentence is referring only to the 80 million tons of waste in the United States, without including the waste anywhere else.)

- Students can work in pairs to list examples of plastic food packaging. Then, invite them to sketch the waste from plastic food packaging they use in a day on their note-catchers.  Invite them to multiply this by seven, visualizing the waste from plastic food packaging they use in a week, then a year, and so on. Direct students to discuss in pairs what they can do to limit the amount of plastic food packaging they consume, to be a part of the solution in reducing plastic pollution.

According to the documentary *A Plastic Ocean*,

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Invite students to work in pairs, sharing with one another the habit of character they think the other most often demonstrates. Invite students to complete the following sentence frame to capture their partner’s response.

> **According to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, the habit of character I demonstrate most often is**

partner’s name

> **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

habit of character

> (e.g., According to <u>my partner Mai Choua</u>, the habit of character I demonstrate most often is <u>compassion</u>.) 

- To provide lighter support: Invite students to extend the frame by adding the preposition **by** to share ways the habit of character is demonstrated. (e.g., According to <u>my partner Mai Choua</u>, the habit of character I demonstrate most often is <u>compassion</u> by <u>always helping friends in need</u>.)

- To provide heavier support: Invite students to discuss the meaning of the sentence in home language groups.

According to the documentary *A Plastic Ocean*, “80 million tons of waste in the U.S. alone, every year, comes from plastic food packaging.”

“What is the relationship between this sentence and the two sentences before it?” (“Where does all this plastic come from? There are many forms of plastic pollution, but let’s just focus on the kind I was carrying to the river with me that day.”) (This sentence adds research supporting the information in the previous two sentences, providing facts about where the type of plastic the narrator is talking about comes from.)

“Why does the author include this sentence in the argument section of the Model Documentary Script?” (The author includes this sentence in this section because incorporating research is essential to building a credible argument.)

“What if we remove the prepositional phrase According to the documentary A Plastic Ocean from this sentence? How does that change the meaning?” (We still have a grammatically correct sentence, but we no longer know the source of the information stated. We would be less likely to view the information as credible without knowing the source.)

“Who can explain why your classmate came up with that response?” (Answers will vary.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Answers will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question:  
What can be done about plastic pollution? What is being done? What can I do?” (Answers will vary.)
