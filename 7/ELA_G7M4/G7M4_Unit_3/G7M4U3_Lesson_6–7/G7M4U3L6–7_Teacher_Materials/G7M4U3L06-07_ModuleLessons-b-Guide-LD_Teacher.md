Language Dive Guide: Model Documentary Script, Argument Section

SL.7.4, L.7.1a

(For Teacher Reference)

***Note: Language Dives in Modules 3–4 are designed for gradual release from  
Modules 1–2. Please carefully read the Gradual Release section below for complete details.***

**Sentence**

**According to the documentary *A Plastic Ocean*,** “80 million tons of waste in the U.S. alone, every year, comes from plastic food packaging.” (Model Documentary Script: “Lunch, Hold the Plastic” by EL Education, sixth sentence of the Argument section of the documentary script)

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: This sentence helps students to address L.7.1a by highlighting a sentence that uses a prepositional phrase to introduce research supporting the claim in the Model Documentary Script. It also helps to address SL.7.4 by inviting students to discuss how to include and present findings in their own documentary scripts.

- Big Idea: This sentence helps students respond to the Module Big Idea (**Plastic pollutes our world \[especially our oceans\] when people dispose of it incorrectly**) by presenting a fact about the amount of waste we produce every year in the US alone.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it includes a prepositional phrase (**According to the documentary *A Plastic Ocean*,**) that introduces research supporting a claim from the Model Documentary Script. Invite students to discuss each chunk briefly, but encourage extended conversation and practice with the focus structure: **According to the documentary *A Plastic Ocean***.

- Practice and Transfer: After discussing the focus structure, students practice using it to discuss something in their lives. Students transfer their understanding of the meaning of this sentence as they write the argument section of their own documentary scripts, which will be used to create their storyboard pitch for the end of unit assessment and their documentary for the module performance task.

- Delivery: The focus structure practice (**According to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, the habit of character I demonstrate most often is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**) is presented out of order to provide additional context and allow for better understanding and discussion.

Gradual Release in Module 3–4 Language Dives from Modules 1 and 2

**Materials**

- This Guide: the selected sentence, rationale, and lesson timing, as well as a fixed list of steps and best practices for leading Language Dives

- Sentence Chunk Chart: the sentence chunks for the selected sentence, as well as a list of options of questions and activities to support student understanding of the language structures in each chunk

- Note-catcher: guidance to support students in leading sections of the Language Dive independently as well as areas for notes from teacher-led sections of the Dive

- Sentence chunk strips: the sentence chunks written on separate strips

- Questions We Can Ask during a Language Dive anchor chart: questions students can ask one another to foster the inquiry-based approach to understanding how English works (Teachers may also ask these questions.)

- Conversation Cues anchor chart: continued from Modules 1 and 2

**Implement and Foster Student Independence**

- Use this Guide along with the Sentence Chunk Chart, note-catcher, sentence chunk strips, Questions We Can Ask during a Language Dive anchor chart, and Conversation Cues anchor chart.

- Continue to build a culture of grappling. Talk about what perseverance, discomfort, and risk looks and sounds like during a Language Dive, and develop tips for analyzing language and norms for calling on peers for support. Students can use these skills as a way to make meaning across the school day and in their personal lives.

- Employ a range of strategies to enable students to understand and apply the language structures in the Sentence Chunk Chart, including asking questions and using Conversation Cues, sketching, acting out, identifying parts of speech, personalizing the language structures, and displaying some of the questions and activities in the Chunk Chart for students themselves to consider.

- Draw on your understanding and experience of Language Dives from Modules 1 and 2 to optimize this new format.

**Optimize Conversation Cues**

- Use Conversation Cues as often as possible to gradually release thinking and expression of ideas to students; avoid using Conversation Cues as a way of searching for the “right” answer. Students often struggle to create productive and equitable conversation during Turn and Talk or Think-Pair-Share protocols; Conversation Cues can make the difference. Recall that the main goals of Conversation Cues are supporting students to express their ideas (Goal 1), listen to other students’ ideas (Goal 2), deepen their own ideas (Goal 3), and build on other students’ ideas (Goal 4).

- Consider this model transcription from a classroom where about 85% of students are ELLs. The teacher is supporting students to build their ideas about the choice an author made when writing this sentence about an athlete’s factors for success: **There were many factors that led to Rickey’s success, but it was support from others in baseball that was most important.** Students can carry the Conversation Cues into small groups to support their own independent productive and equitable conversations.

> Mr. Valencia: What if I replace **but** with **and**? **And** is also a conjunction. How would **and** change the meaning? I’ll give you some time to think. Emma, you want to give it  
> a shot?
>
> Emma: It is adding on to the, like, the idea, of the first (part of the) sentence?
>
> Mr. Valencia: Can anyone repeat or rephrase what Emma just said?
>
> Santiago: It would have the same idea as the first two chunks.
>
> Mr. Valencia: Right, **and** would have the same idea as the first two chunks. Two connecting, same ideas. So how does **but** change that for me? Jazmin?
>
> Jazmin: **But** would change it.
>
> Mr. Valencia: Can you say more about that, Jazmin?
>
> Jazmin: It would change it because **but** would say there are many things happening, but this is the one.
>
> Mr. Valencia: So does anyone want to add something else to that?
>
> Daniel: **But** is saying this is the main thing happening.
>
> Mr. Valencia: Right, now the sentence is going to the main factor (for success), or a contrast. **But** is something that is going to tell us a contrast. (Exchange continues.)

**Discus Grammar Strategically**

- Use grammar terminology primarily as another tool for accessing meaning and purpose of a chunk or sentence. If students find themselves grappling with parts of speech for too long, maintain momentum by asking what a structure means, or why the author used the structure.

- Keep in mind that explicit grammar knowledge is an important component of meeting college- and career-ready standards; use language standards as a type of scope and sequence for mastering grammar in Language Dives.

Process

**Throughout the Language Dive**

- Refer to a chunk on display by pointing to it or inviting students to place their finger by the same chunk.

- Record and display student discussion next to or underneath each chunk on display for visual reference.

- Refer to the Questions We Can Ask during a Language Dive anchor chart and Conversation Cues anchor chart.

- Invite students to use a translation dictionary and add vocabulary and collocations to their vocabulary log.

- Students can work on their note-catcher for each item marked with the icon .

**Suggested Sequence for Completing a Language Dive**

Consider preteaching one or two key vocabulary words to the whole group.

Reconstruct

- First, organize students into small groups of three or four students. Distribute one set of cut, scrambled sentence chunk strips to each group.

- Then, using the note-catcher  in groups, students discuss ways to rearrange the chunks to make a meaningful sentence. Once they’ve reassembled the chunks, they take turns paraphrasing the chunks in order. Next, they discuss what the sentence is about. Beginning the Language Dive with this Reconstruct move can challenge and engage students and support independence.

Deconstruct (Chunks That Are Not the Focus Structure)

- Reconvene the whole group. Display the sentence chunk strips, sequenced as a sentence. Read aloud the sentence twice; students read aloud the sentence with  
  a partner.

- Briefly grapple with the meaning of the sentence and connection to the guiding question or big idea.

- Display each chunk, one by one. Direct students to briefly grapple with the meaning of each chunk. Use the Sentence Chunk Chart to guide student grappling. Pause for the Focus Structure (see Step 6).

- As students discuss the highlighted focus structure, direct them to slow down for extended conversation and practice of the focus structure. See suggested questions and Conversation Cues in the Sentence Chunk Chart.

- To provide lighter support: Display one or more of the options of questions and activities provided in the Sentence Chunk Chart, or an adaptation of it, to prompt student grappling.

- To provide heavier support: Use visuals or realia to help convey meaning. Use the options of questions and activities provided in the Sentence Chunk Chart to pose questions requiring careful consideration. Monitor with total participation techniques and Conversation Cues. Provide think time and invite partners to discuss in English or in home language groups.

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Back in small groups, using the note-catcher  and the Questions We Can Ask  
  during a Language Dive anchor chart, students discuss the meaning and purpose  
  of the chunk.

- Reconvene the whole group. Use the Sentence Chunk Chart to provide additional support in understanding the focus structure.

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Students use the focus structure themselves. Refer to the Sentence Chunk Chart for specific Practice suggestions on this sentence, and for heavier and lighter support.

Reconstruct

- Students reconstruct the meaning of sentence, play with the sentence structure, and make connections to guiding question, big idea, learning target. Refer to the Sentence Chunk Chart for specific Reconstruct suggestions on this sentence.

Practice (Sentence)

- Finally, students synthesize and use the sentence structures themselves. Refer to the Sentence Chunk Chart for specific Practice suggestions on this sentence, and for heavier and lighter support.

**Overall Principles**

- For Students: The Modules 3 and 4 note-catcher contains sections that encourage students to take more of the lead in the conversation. The Questions We Can Ask during a Language Dive anchor chart supports students in taking an inquiry-based approach to language in general, and the selected sentence in particular, thus building greater independence to discover how English works.

- For Teachers: The Modules 3 and 4 Language Dive Sentence Chunk Charts provide a list of options for questions and activities to support student understanding of the language structures in each chunk. Use this chart to plan how to best meet students’ language and content needs. This is different from Modules 1 and 2, in which a fixed series of steps and questions were provided in the Language Dive Guide.
