Grade 7: Module 4: Unit 3: Lessons 6–7

Lesson Overview

Lesson Summary

Students participate in a Language Dive on a sentence from the Model Documentary Script, analyzing how the author uses evidence to support the argument. Then students engage in a Tuning protocol as a triad to give each other feedback on the effective use of claims and findings (including points, key descriptions, facts, details, or examples) to address the purpose and audience. Students complete the mid-unit assessment by independently revising their section of the documentary script, focusing on effectively supporting claims with findings.

Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- SL.7.4 – Work Time A: In a Language Dive, students analyze a sentence from the Model Documentary Script by highlighting the use of a prepositional phrase to introduce a fact and detail that supports a finding.

- W.7.5 – Work Time B: In a Tuning protocol, students guide and support peers to develop and strengthen their writing in the documentary script by focusing on the effective use of claims and findings (including points, key descriptions, facts, details, or examples) to address the purpose and audience.

- For the mid-unit assessment, students revise their part of a documentary script to improve their effective use of claims and findings (including points, key descriptions, facts, details, or examples) to address the purpose and audience. (W.7.5)

- In this lesson, students focus on the habits of character of working to contribute to a better world and working to become an effective learner. The characteristics that students are reminded of specifically are “using my strengths” as they participate in peer critique and “taking responsibility” as they self-assess and revise their writing.

- The Tuning protocol is used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

- Continue to use Goals 1–4 Conversation Cues to promote productive and equitable conversation.

- Student triads must determine who will present the narrative lead during the Tuning protocol of Work Time B. Each member of the triad will present the section they wrote. If necessary, suggest that one student read the lead in addition to their section or that they divide up the lead into beginning, middle, and end and each member of the triad reads one part.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- During the Work Time B, release students who are able to work independently without modeling.

- Invite students who are adept at the Tuning protocol to model the collaborative conversation.

- Pair those students who demonstrate greater proficiency with the writing and planning process with those in need of extra support during the Tuning protocol.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Students revise their documentary script drafts planned and written in the previous lesson.

Support All Students

- Students may need additional support providing feedback. Make the Discussion Norms anchor chart readily accessible, and coach students to use the conversation cues. Showing a quick video of a Tuning protocol or peer feedback lesson from EL’s website might support students with this work. Alternatively, conduct a fishbowl with a particularly strong group’s Tuning protocol, discussing what makes their process exemplary.▲

- Much of this lesson is discussion-based, so some students may need additional support with oral language and/or auditory processing. Provide students with sentence frames or a note-taking template to use during discussion. ▲

- Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this lesson that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually.

- To support ELLs, the assessment in this lesson consists of tasks students have practiced throughout the year (tuning and revising). This gradual release supports students in independent achievement on this assessment.

- ELLs may find it challenging to offer feedback to their peers in a Tuning protocol. They may not feel comfortable giving feedback on another’s work. As necessary, assure students that they will give both positive and helpful feedback, which is not the same as passing judgment on the person. Remind students that peer critique is beneficial to both the reviewer and reviewee to evaluate when something is well done or needs more work.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, 7.I.C.10, 7.I.C.12, 7.II.B.5, 7.II.C.6, and 7.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ documentary film script after the lesson to determine whether students have appropriately and sufficiently revised for the effective use of claims and findings (including points, key descriptions, facts, details, or examples) to address the purpose and audience. Documentary scripts should include effective claims and findings about the problem of plastic pollution and the effects of the action plans students are proposing. The descriptions, facts, details, and examples they include should help to make these ideas clear to the audience of their documentary clip, which may include people who are not as familiar with the issues surrounding plastic pollution.

- Refer to the Grade 7 Revision Rubric when reviewing students’ work to determine areas in which they require more instruction and/or support (see the Tools Page at http://eled.org/tools).

- Use the Grade 7 Speaking and Listening Informal Assessment: Collaborative Discussion checklist during the peer critique in Work Time B (see the Tools Page at http://eled.org/tools).

- Consider using the Grade 7 Writing Process checklist during students’ revisions in Closing and Assessment A (see the Tools page: http://eled.org/tools).

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will use their revised script to plan a presentation of their documentary film script.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Ensure there is a copy of Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lessons 6–7 at each student’s workspace.

- Strategically pair students for the Tuning protocol in Work Time B. Review the Tuning protocol (see the Classroom Protocols document on the Tools page: http://eled.org/tools).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Closing and Assessment A: If students used a word processor to write their pieces, they will revise their writing using the same tool. To show their revisions from this lesson, students should use track changes.

- Closing and Assessment A: Students can use speech-to-text facilities activated on devices or use an app or software such as http://eled.org/0103.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Return **End of Unit 2 Assessments with feedback**, and allow students time to review feedback and write their name on the board if they require support.

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lessons 6–7**. Students choose whether to share their goals for this assessment with a partner.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Language Dive: Model Documentary Script, Argument Section – SL.7.4 (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to facilitate a Language Dive with the following sentence from the Model Documentary Script:

- “According to the documentary *A Plastic Ocean*, ‘80 million tons of waste in the U.S. alone, every year, comes from plastic food packaging.’”

- Use the accompanying materials to facilitate the Language Dive:

- **Language Dive Guide: Model Documentary Script, Argument Section (for teacher reference)**

- **Language Dive: Model Documentary Script, Argument Section Sentence Chunk Chart (for teacher reference)**

- **Language Dive: Model Documentary Script, Argument Section note-catcher (example for teacher reference)**

- **Language Dive: Model Documentary Script, Argument Section note-catcher**

- **Language Dive: Model Documentary Script, Argument Section sentence chunk strips**

For Lighter Support

- During the Language Dive of Work Time A, students analyze the use of evidence and a modifying phrase to support a claim in the Model Documentary Script. Invite students to remind their classmates of what a modifying phrase is (describes or modifies a noun) and where they should be placed in a sentence (near the noun they modify). Ask students to skim the Model Documentary Script to find additional examples of modifying phrases and share them with their classmates, identifying the nouns they modify. Teaching others helps students confirm their knowledge of language structures.

For Heavier Support

- During the Language Dive of Work Time A, some students may need additional support as they complete the sentence frame in the Practice section (*According to the text \_\_\_\_\_\_\_.*). Allow time for students to work in their triads to find evidence they have included in their documentary script and use this frame to convey the evidence.

Work Time

B. Tuning Protocol – W.7.5 (30 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can revise and strengthen a documentary script, focusing on how well the purpose and audience have been addressed.”

- Explain to students that they will now share their script with another triad to get feedback on the content. Allow several minutes for triads to determine who will read the narrative lead. (See Teaching Notes for suggestions on dividing the narrative lead.) Other sections will be read by the person who wrote the section.

- Move students into groups with their own documentary triad and another documentary triad, and invite them to label their groups A and B.

- Distribute **sticky notes**.

- Focus students on the **Work to Contribute to a Better World anchor chart**, specifically “I use my strengths to help others grow.” Remind students that as they work to critique the other triad’s work, they will need to use their strengths, as well as other important character traits and academic mindsets. Ask students:

“Which academic mindsets and character traits are required to provide feedback, and why?” (To provide feedback, you must feel that the work has value for you, otherwise the feedback you give won’t be very strong. To provide feedback, you must be able to collaborate and have empathy and compassion, because you need to work well with others to give and take feedback, and you need to be aware and considerate of the feelings of those receiving feedback so you will share it well.)

“Which academic mindsets and character traits are required to receive feedback, and why?” (To receive feedback, you must feel that your ability and competence grow with effort, so that you’re able to take the feedback and use it to improve your work. To receive feedback, you must be able to persevere, so that you keep working to improve your writing.)

- Tell students they will provide the other triad with kind, specific, and helpful feedback against the first three criteria on the Presentation checklist.

- Direct students’ attention to the **Peer Critique anchor chart**, and remind them of what peer critique looks and sounds like.

- Display, distribute, and read aloud **Directions for Tuning Protocol**. Invite students to ask questions to ensure that they understand the protocol. Remind them of the Tuning protocol they participated in during Unit 2.

- Tell students that for this Tuning protocol, those students giving feedback can play the role of producers, who are responsible for giving feedback on the documentary and making sure it is the best it can possibly be. Students giving feedback should focus on the first three rows of the Presentation checklist, putting themselves in the roles of listeners and telling the presenting group whether their content is clear and engaging. Explain to students that in the following assessment activity, they will revise their scripts in response to this feedback.

- Invite students to retrieve their **documentary script drafts** and **Presentation checklists**. Then instruct students to begin the Tuning protocol.

- Circulate to support students as they work to give feedback to one another. Emphasize that students are not to make revisions yet, as they will do so in the following assessment activity.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- For the Tuning protocol in Work Time B, ensure each student has a copy of the script under review so they can follow along. Provide sentence frames for students to use in giving feedback. For example:

- This section/sentence/example is good because . . .

- In this section/sentence/example, can you try . . . because . . .

Closing and Assessment

A. Mid-Unit 3 Assessment: Revise and Edit a Documentary Script – W.7.5 (40 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can revise and strengthen a documentary script, focusing on how well purpose and audience have been addressed.”

- Tell students they will begin revising their portion of the documentary script drafts for their effective use of claims and findings (including points, key descriptions, facts, details, or examples) to address the purpose and audience. Remind them that they should refer to the criterion just reviewed on the Presentation checklist, the feedback from a peer during the Tuning protocol, and their analysis of the **Model Documentary Script** as they revise. They may also need to consult their copies of the **texts from Module 4** for additional examples, details, or facts.

- Ensure students use a different colored pen or pencil from the one they drafted their script, so that their revisions can be easily assessed.

- Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**, specifically “I take responsibility.” Remind students that since they will be self-assessing and revising their work, they will need to take ownership of their writing and think about how to change or improve it.

- Emphasize that they should revise only where it is necessary (e.g., adding points, key descriptions, facts, details, or examples) only when necessary to better address the purpose of the presentation and the intended audience).

- Invite students to begin making revisions.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- Before the mid-unit assessment in Closing and Assessment A, challenge students to underline key vocabulary in the assessment directions as they are read aloud to the class. Also, invite students to restate or clarify information for students who need heavier support. These supports ensure that students understand the assessment task.

For Heavier Support

- Before the mid-unit assessment in Closing and Assessment A, read the directions for the assessment aloud slowly, twice, and also post them. This ensures that ELLs who may not be able to easily follow the language of the directions have multiple opportunities to access them.

- For the assessment, students may be overwhelmed by the number of criteria and may be better served to focus on one or two criteria from the checklist. Limiting students’ focus will ensure greater success on the revision task.

Homework

A. Reflect on Writing Process

- Students reflect on their improvement as writers over the course of the writing process from planning to writing to revision and set goals for future writing to complete **Homework: Reflect on Writing Process**.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.

For Lighter Support

- Before the end of class, encourage students to work with a partner to review the homework questions and orally rehearse their answers. Doing so will ensure their comprehension and achievement.

For Heavier Support

- Before the end of class, review the homework questions and model using the words in the prompt to form sentence frames. For example:

- My writing has improved in . . .

- My strengths as a writer are . . .

- My goals as a writer are . . .
