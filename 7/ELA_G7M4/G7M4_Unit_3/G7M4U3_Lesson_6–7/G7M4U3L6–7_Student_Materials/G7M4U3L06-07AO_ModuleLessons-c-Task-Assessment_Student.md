**Directions:** Join with another triad, and follow the Directions for Tuning Protocol (on a separate handout), focusing on giving feedback on the effective use of claims and findings (including points, key descriptions, facts, details, or examples) to address the purpose and audience. (W.7.5)

Once you have given and received feedback on the effective use of claims and findings (including points, key descriptions, facts, details, or examples) to address the purpose and audience, revise your portion of the documentary script to improve your use of claims and findings to address the purpose and audience.

1.  Reread the draft of your portion of the documentary script.

2.  Read the feedback, and consider how you can use this feedback to improve your work. You may or may not agree with all the feedback, but you should consider it and incorporate the suggestions that you agree will improve your writing as well as any revisions you wish to make after reading your script multiple times.

3.  Revise your portion of the documentary script to improve your use of claims and findings (including points, key descriptions, facts, details, or examples) to address the purpose and audience, clearly marking what revisions you have made using a colored pencil or track changes in a word processing platform.
