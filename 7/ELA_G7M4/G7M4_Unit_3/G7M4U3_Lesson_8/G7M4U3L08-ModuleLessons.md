Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- SL.7.5 – Opening A: On an entrance ticket, students consider what goes into making an effective storyboard.

- SL.7.5 – Work Time A: Students review the criteria and expectations for the performance task, including presenting findings; emphasizing salient points in a focused, coherent manner with pertinent descriptions, details, and examples; and using appropriate eye contact, adequate volume, and clear pronunciation.

- SL.7.5 – Work Time B: Students analyze a model storyboard, noting techniques that make it effective, determining the purpose and important elements and generating ideas for their own storyboards.

- SL.7.4 – Closing and Assessment A: Students review their own scripts to brainstorm ideas for their storyboards, and, if time allows, begin work on the storyboards.

- In this lesson, students focus on becoming effective learners by collaborating with their documentary triads to analyze a model storyboard and begin creating their own.

- The Think-Pair-Share protocol is used in this lesson. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Invite students who are enjoying this work to research other storyboards for documentaries or fictional films they are familiar with on the internet and create a list of strengths of these exemplars to share with the class.

- Ask students to find or create alternative images or captions to represent the ideas on the model storyboard to practice converting their ideas to images.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students have analyzed a model documentary as well as created their own documentary scripts about plastic pollution. In this lesson, students begin the process of transforming their scripts into visual plans for their documentaries by analyzing a model storyboard and beginning the process of creating their own storyboards.

Support All Students

- The subject matter in the works selected may include descriptions of plastic pollution causing harm to the environment and animals. Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this chapter that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually. To support students in processing this content, ask: “What habit of character did you use as you discussed this content?” Students may need to draw on perseverance, empathy, or compassion as they read and discuss this content, being sensitive to their own and others’ reactions to the information presented.

- Students may need additional support in understanding the relationship between the script and the images in the storyboard. Ask students to think about simpler relationships between written words and images. For instance, ask students to think of an image for a script about a recycling bin. Work with small strategy groups to support students in understanding and completing the tasks. ▲

- Throughout this unit, encourage students to work in documentary triads to create their documentary. This will support students in planning and creating the performance task documentary development. It also helps to develop collaboration skills, which are essential for college and career readiness. However, if some students work better independently or in pairs for this unit, permit them to do so. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson provides students with the opportunity to collaborate in triads to analyze the Model Documentary Storyboard as well as to plan their own storyboard, which supports students with comprehension and speaking and listening practice.

- ELLs may find it challenging to complete the Analyze a Model Storyboard note-catcher. In addition to the supports below, draw together the struggling students and use a think-aloud to model analyzing the first two sections of the storyboard, recording responses on a blank copy of the note-catcher. Then students can work as a group to analyze the next two sections using the model responses on the sample note-catcher.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 7.I.A.1, 7.I.B.5, and 7.I.B.6.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ exit tickets to ensure they have brainstormed appropriate images to use for their storyboards as well as divided their work in an effective way.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue organizing their exhibits, draft their curator’s statement, and write a label for their visual piece.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Ensure there is a copy of Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 8 at each student’s workspace.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

- Make copies of the Performance Task anchor chart so each student has a copy of the expectations.

Technology and Multimedia

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous modules to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – SL.7.5 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Students respond to questions on **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 8**.

- Once students have completed their entrance tickets, use a total participation technique to review their responses.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

- With students, use the vocabulary strategies on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart** to deconstruct the term *pitch* (a brief explanation of a project meant to cause excitement or win support from the audience), *storyboard* (a document containing images, descriptions, and parts of a script, used to help filmmakers visually plan movie), *captions* (descriptions of images), and *panels* (the boxes in the storyboard where the drawings are made). Record on the **domain-specific word wall** with translations in home languages, where appropriate, and invite students to record words in their **vocabulary logs**.

For Lighter Support

- Encourage students to first grapple to independently respond to the prompts on the entrance ticket. Then they can share their ideas with their documentary triad. Grappling first will increase students’ confidence and success on future independent tasks.

For Heavier Support

- Encourage students to work in their documentary triad to discuss and respond to the prompts on the entrance ticket. Working together ensures comprehension and success on the task as well as an opportunity to practice speaking and listening skills.

Work Time

A. Review the Performance Task – SL.7.5 (5 minutes)

- Display and distribute copies of the **Performance Task anchor chart**. Ask students to Turn and Talk to summarize the expectations and comment about anything that surprises or concerns them. (Ask students with concerns to write their names on the board, so they can get some support.) Ensure that students understand the different elements of the storyboards, including images, captions, and excerpts from their scripts. Students should also understand that the storyboard is the next step in helping them turn their ideas into a “visual plan” before they begin filming their documentaries. The storyboard will also be used as a reference for explaining the plan of the documentary to their peers, when they present their documentary plans in a “pitch” for their end of unit assessment.

- Have students Think-Pair-Share about additional criteria they might include in their storyboard to make them effective. Record student responses on the chart. Inform students that today they will analyze a model documentary storyboard to develop criteria for their own storyboard. Later in the lesson, students will use their own script as the basis for creating their storyboards.

Work Time

B. Analyze a Model Documentary Storyboard – SL.7.5 (20 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can generate criteria for a documentary clip storyboard on plastic pollution.”

- Ask students to retrieve their **Presentation checklist**, focusing on the SL.7.5 criteria (the seventh row). Then ask students to Think-Pair-Share:

“How will the criteria on the Presentation checklist help you make decisions about the content and language of your storyboard?” (The Presentation checklist focuses on “including multimedia components and visual displays” in order to “clarify claims and findings and emphasize salient points,” which helps remind us to really focus on how the storyboard will help us emphasize the ideas in our documentary clip pitch presentation.)

- Confirm for students that the Presentation checklist will help them consider how to create their storyboards to best convey their ideas during their pitch presentations.

- Allow several minutes for students to generate criteria for the third column of the SL.7.5 row of the Presentation checklist based on this discussion. Circulate and use the **Presentation checklist (example for teacher reference)** for sample criteria as necessary.

- Inform students that they will now examine a model documentary storyboard. Remind students that they will begin creating their own storyboards in this lesson and continue working on it in the next lesson.

- Distribute and display the **Model Documentary Storyboard**. Explain that this storyboard was created based on the Model Documentary Script they analyzed in Lesson 1. Similarly, students will be using their own documentary scripts to create their storyboards.

- Tell students that they will now analyze the model storyboard to decide what makes it an effective visual guide for planning and explaining their documentary idea to others.

- Distribute the **Analyze a Model Storyboard note-catcher**, and note that students will take notes below each heading. Explain that they will look at the Model Documentary Storyboard and identify how the filmmaker added images and captions to show what they planned on filming for their documentary clip. Ensure that students note the images, descriptions, relationship of images to the script, and any questions they may have.

- Invite students to Turn and Talk with their triads about the prompts on their note-catchers. Ask students to record their answers for each prompt and ask for volunteers to share out. On the displayed Model Documentary Storyboard, draw arrows to highlight the examples of each part of the model listed on the note-catcher.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time B, encourage students to first write their analysis in their note-catchers and then share them with their triad as they examine each section of the Model Documentary Storyboard. Doing so will increase students’ independence and achievement on future analysis and writing activities.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time B, allow students to conduct the analysis in the modality that best suits them. They may want to record their responses in writing or practice their oral responses with their triad. They may want to discuss or record their responses in their home language. Allowing students to respond in multiple ways increases their confidence and success in analyzing the Model Documentary Storyboard.

Closing and Assessment

A. Begin Documentary Storyboard – SL.7.4 (15 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can create a storyboard with images, captions, and my documentary clip script on plastic pollution.”

- Invite students to join with their documentary triad to analyze their script in order to begin brainstorming about how to turn it into a storyboard. Direct students to discuss which points to emphasize, which images to add, and how to approach the process. Students should then divide up the script so that each triad member can contribute equally to brainstorming ideas and creating the storyboard. They should also decide whether they want to draw their storyboard images on paper or use an online storyboard creation tool such as http://eled.org/0254 or http://eled.org/0135.

- Invite students to begin their storyboards. Distribute the **Storyboard template** for students who are hand-drawing their storyboards. If students decide to use an online tool, ensure they understand how to use it before they leave class.

- Ask students to fill out their **Exit Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 8** before leaving, to ensure that they have chosen a part of the script to turn into a storyboard as well as begun brainstorming possible ideas for images to find or draw to help show their plans for their documentary clips.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- Students may have experience with drawing panels to represent ideas as in graphic novel or comic strip creation. Ask these students to share their experiences with the class. As necessary, prompt these students with questions such as:

- How do you know what image to draw or create? What do you do before you draw or create an image? What do you do as you draw or create an image? What do you do when you’re done drawing or creating an image? How do you connect the image back to the idea or story?

- Asset-based instruction increases students’ confidence and engagement with creating a storyboard.

For Heavier Support

- See For Lighter Support. However, if a student doesn’t feel comfortable sharing with a large group, they may want to share with a partner or teacher who can share with the class; write or draw their responses for another to share; or share in their home language. Asset-based instruction increases students’ confidence and engagement with creating a storyboard.

Homework

A. Optional: Continue Storyboard

- If students have access to the appropriate technology or materials, students can continue working on their storyboards, to be completed in the following lesson.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
