Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 8

SL.7.5

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, complete the following prompts below.

For the next couple of lessons, you will analyze a model storyboard and create your own storyboard based on your script. Recall that a storyboard is a graphic organizer that filmmakers use to help them imagine how their films might look. The images and captions of the storyboard show how the script will be made into a video.

Given this definition, describe the storyboard for your documentary. How will you use images and captions in your storyboard? Explain what an effective storyboard looks like.

The storyboard for our documentary clips will contain images of the ideas and scenes we mention in our scripts. The captions will help describe what the images are, and the script will explain what will be said during the documentary. To be effective, our storyboards should clearly show what we plan to film and how the images will add to the script.
