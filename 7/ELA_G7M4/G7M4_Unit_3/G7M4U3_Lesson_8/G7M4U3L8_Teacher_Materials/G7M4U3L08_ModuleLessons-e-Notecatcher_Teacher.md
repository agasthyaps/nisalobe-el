| **Narrative Lead**    | **The images help show the girl’s reactions to finding the plastic bag in the river and then her disappointment when she realizes she’s also using plastic. The captions help to clarify these reactions.**                |
| **Argument**          | **The images and captions explain how this information will be provided through shots of the girl doing research and pictures of people throwing away plastic as well as through the statistics mentioned in the script.** |
| **Action Plan**       | **The images clearly show what the girl is bringing into the restaurant and her conversation with the owner.**                                                                                                             |

What is the overall purpose of this storyboard? How will developing a similar storyboard help you plan your documentary clips and present your plans in a “pitch” to your peers?

The overall purpose of the storyboard is to show with images how the filmmaker plans to make the script into a video. Making our own storyboards will help us plan how we will film our documentary clip.
