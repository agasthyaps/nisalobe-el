Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- L.6.5 – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they identify examples of figurative language in chapter 4 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* and explain how these examples contribute to the development of the story.

- L.6.5 – Work Time A: Students participate in a Language Dive that invites them to interpret the authors’ use of personification in a sentence from chapter 4 of the text.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time B: Students participate in a close read of an informational text called “William Kamkwamba’s Electric Wind,” using textual evidence to support their understanding of the text.

- RI.6.2 – Work Time B: Students identify the central idea of “William Kamkwamba’s Electric Wind” by examining key details.

- RI.6.4 – Work Time B: During the close read, students determine the technical, connotative, and figurative meanings of words as they are used in an informational text.

- L.6.4 – Work Time B: During the close read, students use a range of strategies to interpret unfamiliar vocabulary in an informational text.

- RI.6.3 – Closing and Assessment A: Students collaborate with classmates to add to their Analyze Key Individual note-catchers.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners by collaborating as they work in triads during the close read.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- There are many engaging ways to practice playing with word connotation. For example, students could be given paint cards from a hardware store and fill them in with varying “shades” of a word (e.g., “happy,” “joyful,” and “elated” show varying degrees of an emotion). Invite students to think of scenarios in which a word with a stronger connotation would better communicate a point.

- Consider using a speech given at an important historical event (e.g., Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation, Martin Luther King Jr.’s I Have a Dream speech), and guide students to annotate the speech for words with particularly strong connotation. Explain how the authors deliberately chose words with specific connotations to communicate their feelings about the event.

- The close read in this lesson guides students to identify a central idea. The Grade 7 standard requires students to determine more than one central idea, so to extend learning encourage students to identify more than one central idea in the text excerpt. Also, encourage students to identify one or more central ideas in additional texts on the topic, for examples texts at a higher Lexile® listed in Recommended Texts and Other Resources.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Students completed the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment in the previous lesson for which they identified the central idea of a text and key details to support that idea. The second half of this unit builds on those skills and continues practicing summary writing which was first introduced in Module 1.

- In this lesson, students transfer those skills to a new informational text.

Support All Students

- The drought and famine are first described in chapter 4 and remain a major theme throughout the first half of the novel. Descriptions of the famine may be upsetting to some students, especially those who come from environments with limited food security. Allow students to express and process their feelings about the suffering described in the book.

- The close read and Language Dive of this lesson are intended to facilitate “pauses” that allow readers to dig more deeply into the meaning of a chapter or sentence. These activities are critical for the development of ELLs’ reading and linguistic skills. To help students begin to connect the strategies of the close read and Language Dive to their own independent reading, debrief by encouraging students to identify new reading strategies they learned. ▲

- Students may need additional support with recording their answers on their note-catchers. Group those students for additional support when necessary. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson invites students to participate in the first Language Dive and close read of Module 2. The close read features a supplemental informational text about William, which students can compare to the anchor text. Both of these tasks facilitate a deep look at a text or sentence and offer strategies that students can practice when they read other texts on their own.

- ELLs may find it challenging to read about William from a new informational text. At this point in the unit, students have only read from *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, and thus are most familiar with the style and approach of that text. Remind students that the close read offers support and guidance so that students can understand the central idea(s) and details of what they read. Close reads support slow, careful, and collaborative reading, which is especially helpful for developing readers.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.7, 6.I.B.8, 6.II.A.1, 6.II.B.4, 6.II.B.5, and 6.II.C.6.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Language Dive note-catchers to ensure students understand several ways to analyze and interpret figurative language.

- Review students’ Close Read note-catchers to ensure students understand different strategies for determining the technical, figurative, and connotative meanings of new vocabulary.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue in the anchor text reading the first half of chapter 5. They will be introduced to the Structure anchor chart and begin analyzing how a particular sentence contributes to the structure of the text and helps to convey the central idea.

- Plan also to launch the Independent Research Reading task in the next lesson.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare Language Dive sentence chunk strips.

- Gather colored markers for annotation work during the Language Dive.

- Strategically group students into triads for the work in this lesson, with at least one strong reader per triad. ▲

- Preview the Close Reading Guide: “William Kamkwamba’s Electric Wind” and Close Read: “William Kamkwamba’s Electric Wind” note-catcher to become familiar with what will be required of students.

- Preview the Language Dive Guide and consider how to invite conversation among students to address the questions and goals suggested under each sentence chunk strip. Select from the questions and goals provided to best meet students’ needs.

- Prepare copies of handouts for students, including entrance ticket (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time B: Students with visual challenges may need a version of the text and note-catchers with larger font and more white space. Consider providing the text and other close reading materials using an online platform such as http://eled.org/0158 so students can adjust the size of the font and the typeface.

- Work Time B: Some typefaces, especially sans serif typefaces, have been shown to ease reading for students with dyslexia. Specifically, the font located at http://eled.org/0170 can be downloaded for free and used to make materials for students with this need.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.6.5 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 7**. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 7 (answers for teacher reference)** for possible responses. During review, add additional explanation and examples as needed to support student learning.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Language Dive: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, Page 68 – L.6.5 (15 minutes)

- Tell students they will now participate in a Language Dive to analyze and interpret figurative language from chapter 4 of ***The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***. Distribute **colored pencils or markers (green, red, and blue)** to each student.

- Reread aloud the excerpt from *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* starting on page 67 (“But that was . . . ”) and ending on page 68 (“ . . . studied this destruction.”)

- Focus students on the sentence:

- “With no rain, the sun rose angry in the sky each morning and showed no mercy on the seedlings that had survived.”

- Use the **Language Dive Guide: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, **Page 68** to guide students through a Language Dive conversation about the sentence. Distribute and display the **Language Dive: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, **Page 68 note-catcher** and the **Language Dive: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, **Page 68 sentence chunk strips**. Refer to the **Language Dive: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, **Page 68 note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- During the Language Dive of Work Time A, students sketch an image of a sun that “rose angry in the sky and showed no mercy on the seedlings.” Although the time limits of the Language Dive do not permit it, this sentence poses opportunities for continued exploration of figurative language. Challenge ELLs with additional questions that strengthen their understanding of this figurative language: *How can a sun feel angry? Why would authors choose to say it this way?* Additionally, invite ELLs to write their own sentences about the sun using unique figurative language.

For Heavier Support

- During the Language Dive of Work Time A, some students may need additional support as they complete the sentence frame in the Practice section **(With no \_\_\_\_\_, William’s family \_\_\_\_\_)**. Provide a bank of options from which students can select answers to complete the first part of the frame. These may include the following: *money, food, relief from the drought*.

Work Time

B. Close Read: “William Kamkwamba’s Electric Wind” – RI.6.2 (20 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can determine a central idea in the text and how it is conveyed through particular details.”

- Focus students on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart** and remind them that digging into a text deeper can help them understand it better. They are going to deeply examine a supplementary article through a close reading.

- Move students into predetermined triads.

- Direct students’ attention to the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart** and review what collaboration looks and sounds like.

- Distribute and display Close Read Text: “William Kamkwamba’s Electric Wind.” Refer to the guide for how to integrate the **Close Read: “William Kamkwamba’s Electric Wind” note-catcher**. Continue to use discussion protocols (e.g., Think-Pair-Share, Conversation Cues, and total participation techniques) to engage all students in a collaborative discussion about the text.

- Refer to **Close Read: “William Kamkwamba’s Electric Wind” note-catcher (answers for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- Before the close read of Work Time B, invite students to share, aloud or in writing, the key elements of William’s character that they have noticed so far in *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*. This will challenge students’ understanding of the text and prepare them to notice differences in the way William is characterized in the new informational text of the close read.

For Heavier Support

- During the close read of Work Time B, some students may struggle to generate a coherent sentence that encapsulates the central idea of the text. As an alternative to the culminating task, provide students with three or four sentences that describe a possible central idea of the text and invite them to select the most accurate one. Encourage students to highlight evidence in the text that supports their selection.

Closing and Assessment

A. Analyze Key Individual – RI.6.3 (5 minutes)

- Using the Dance Card protocol, choose a color or category from the **dance cards** to assign partners. Guide partners to synthesize what they now know about William to complete the rows for “William Kamkwamba’s Electric Wind” and chapter 4 of their **Analyze Key Individual: William note-catcher**. Remind them of the examples listed on the **Author’s Methods anchor chart**.

- Turn and Talk:

“What method did the author of ‘William Kamkwamba’s Electric Wind’ use to introduce or develop William as a key individual?” (In the article the author uses rich *description* to help us understand that William takes pride in his work and is thorough and thoughtful about that work.)

“Where have we seen something similar previously?” (Chapter 1 of the anchor text.)

- Turn and Talk:

“What method did the authors use in chapter 4 of to develop William as a key individual?” The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind(The authors use *examples* to convey a key idea—how important maize is to daily life—and that William understands the significance of the crop on his family’s life and the survival of the community.)

“Where have we seen something similar previously?” (Chapter 1 of the anchor text.)

- Refer to the **Analyze Key Individual: William note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Use a total participation technique to review and correct any misunderstandings before moving on. Refer to the **Author’s Methods anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

Homework

A. Analyze Author Methods and Central Idea

- Students complete **Homework: Analyze Author Methods and Central Idea: “William Kamkwamba’s Electric Wind.”**

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread chapter 5 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* in preparation for studying the chapter in the next lesson.
