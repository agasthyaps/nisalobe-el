William Kamkwamba’s Electric Wind

When William Kamkwamba was growing up in Masitala, a farming village of about 60 families in Malawi, the best day of the year was Christmas. Then, he, his parents, and his six sisters ate meat with their usual maize porridge and greens. Meat was so rare, his Chichewa \[CHIH-cha-wah\] language has a word, *nkhuli* \[n-KOO-lee\], meaning “great hunger for meat.”

During the rainy season, young William hunted for birds, using traps he fashioned from a hoe, a scarf, bicycle tires, bricks, his mother’s clothesline, and ropes made of blue gum tree bark. With his ingenuity and steady hand, William brought home meat.

But, between 2001 and 2006, drought and famine hit Malawi. Even maize withered and blew away. Limited to one tiny meal a day, the Kamkwambas starved. One Christmas, William ate only boiled goatskin. In 2006, William, 14, dropped out of school; he couldn’t pay the fee of 1,200 kwacha (about \$80). His family was desolate. If only he could help.

<u>Music to Pedal By</u>

William headed to the library, a small room with three walls of books from America and electric lights. Although he knew little English, he figured out from diagrams how water wheels and electromagnets produce electricity; how batteries yield direct current; how magnets concocted from everyday objects make alternating current. A natural mechanic, William powered a radio by connecting one to the dynamo on a bicycle. While he pedaled, his cousin Geoffrey danced to African reggae music.

“*Of course*, he thought. *This is how spinning motion generates power*!” William wrote in his book *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*. And power could provide lighting and move water from the stream to fields. Studying a book on energy, William realized wind could power pumps better than bicycling! All he needed to do was build a windmill.

He rigged a small, test windmill from a plastic bottle, pipes, bamboo, an old battery, wires, and a rubber shoe. When he connected the wires to a radio, he heard music!

“With that success,” William wrote, “I started planning for an even bigger windmill.”

<u>  
Goat Poop</u>

This one required heavier materials—a tractor fan, shock absorber, vats of grease—which William scrounged from a scrap yard. It wasn’t easy, though. Students at his old school nearby called him a madman for digging in garbage. Not understanding why he wanted it, his father almost refused to give him his broken bicycle. To pay a welder, William stacked wood. He accidentally blew up his father’s radio and later ruined his mother’s favorite cooking pot, boiling goat poop to extract biogas!

Months later, he had finally collected all the pieces—except the dynamo he needed for a generator. Then, a friend, Gilbert Wimbe, son of Masitala’s chief, gave him 200 kwacha to buy one. The next day, he started connecting the parts.

<u>“He’s Made Light!”</u>

William spent hours heating a handmade drill to bore holes into plastic blades, each four feet long. He strengthened the blades with bamboo poles, bolted on with washers fashioned from bottle caps. He attached the bicycle, then the dynamo, then chains. William, Gilbert, and Geoffrey felled blue gum trees and constructed a tower, 16 feet high, wrapping its legs in plastic to keep out termites. With a makeshift pulley, they hauled the 90-pound windmill up the tower.

Finally, William inserted a light bulb into a socket handcrafted from a hollow reed and wire. *Here goes*, he thought, setting the blades in motion. A wind gust nearly knocked him off the tower but spun the blades “like furious propellers...I held the bulb before me, waiting for my miracle. It flickered once. Just a flash at first, then a surge of bright, magnificent light. My heart nearly burst.”

A neighbor shouted, “He’s made light!”

William answered, “Electric wind. I told you I wasn’t mad!”

Soon, he dangled a bulb from his bedroom ceiling and installed a switch. In Malawi, where only about five percent of the population has electricity, William “could touch the wall and get lights!”

This wasn’t a miracle. It was his resourcefulness, confidence, and persistence. “If you want to make it,” he said, “all you have to do is try.”

<u>Saved from Destruction</u>

William wasn’t done yet. He built a transformer with a socket and battery; then, people paid him to charge their mobile telephones. After nearly burning down the house, he fabricated a circuit breaker. He built a transmitter, creating his own radio station.

Best of all, in 2007, William, now 24, drilled a well that provides fresh drinking water for his village and irrigation for crops. His mother says William “saved his family from destruction.”

Word of William’s achievements spread. He was asked to speak at a TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design) conference. TED is a non-profit organization devoted to “ideas worth spreading.” With more hard work and help from donors, he finished high school and now gives speeches around the world and studies engineering at Dartmouth College. Through his organization, the Moving Windmills Project, William continues to work toward providing villages throughout Malawi with access to clean water and school and building supplies. Bryan Mealer, the co-author of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, says William’s message “really resonated with a lot of people.”

Thanks to William’s windmill, change is in the air for the people of Malawi.
