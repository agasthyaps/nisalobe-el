**Sentence**

**With no rain,** the sun rose angry in the sky each morning and showed no mercy on the seedlings that had survived. (from page 68 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* by William Kamkwamba and Bryan Mealer)

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Targets and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the Daily Learning Target (**I can interpret figurative language to determine meaning in the text**) and L.6.5 by inviting students to analyze figurative language used to describe a severe drought.

- Supporting Standards: RI.6.1, RI.6.2, RI.6.4, SL.6.1

- Guiding Question: The sentence helps students respond to the guiding question (**How can design thinking help solve a critical problem?**) by adding to students’ understanding of a critical problem addressed in the text: a severe drought and famine in Malawi.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses a prepositional phrase to introduce the sentence and provide important context, it includes several examples of past-tense verbs for quick review, and it features examples of figurative language, including personification and hyperbole. Invite students to discuss each chunk briefly, but encourage extended conversation and practice with the focus structure: **With no rain,**

- Practice and Transfer: After discussing the focus structure, students practice using it to discuss something in their lives. Students transfer their understanding of the meaning and structure of this sentence when interpreting figurative language during activities in the second half of Unit 1 and when describing what makes a problem critical during the text-based discussion at the end of Unit 1.

- Delivery: The chunk **With no rain,** is presented out of order to provide context for the reason presented in the final chunk, allowing for better understanding and discussion.

Deconstruct

- Invite students to put their finger by this sentence from *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* on their note-catchers: **<u>With no rain,</u> the sun rose angry in the sky each morning and showed no mercy on the seedlings that had survived.**

- Read aloud the sentence twice, and then ask students to take turns reading the sentence aloud with their partners.

- Say:

“What does this sentence mean to you?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“How does this sentence add to your understanding of the guiding question, how can design thinking help solve a critical problem?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

on the seedlings that had survived.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following sentence chunk strip: **on the seedlings that had survived.**

- Underline on the seedlings that had survived in green, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 

- Say:

“Does anyone know what seedlings are?” (Young plants that grew from seeds; if students cannot guess the answer, encourage them to think about similar words, like seeds, before providing the answers.)

“Based on your understanding of the book, why did some of the seedlings not survive?” (Because of the drought, which kept some of the seedlings from getting the water they needed.)

the sun

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **the sun**

- Underline the subject the sun in blue, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 

- Say:

“What relationship do you think there is between the sun and the seedlings?” (Responses may vary, but look for students to make mention of the drought and/or heat negatively impacting the seedlings.)

rose angry in the sky each morning and showed no mercy

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **rose angry in the sky each morning and showed no mercy**

- Say:

“What rose angry in the sky each morning? How do you know?” (The sun; because suns rise in the sky.)

“Where do you think this chunk goes in the sentence?” (Between the chunk the sun and the chunk on the seedlings that had survived.)

- Underline the verbs rose and showed in red, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 

- Say:

“These verbs, rose and showed, are in the past tense. What are these verbs in the present tense?” (Rise; show.)

- Underline the noun mercy in blue, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 

- Say:

“Does anyone know what mercy means?” (Kind treatment toward someone or something.)

“What does it mean to ‘show no mercy’? Is this a positive or negative thing?” (It means that you don’t show someone any kindness or forgiveness; it is a negative thing.)

- Draw students’ attention back to the entire chunk.

- Say:

“Which type of figurative language is being used in this chunk?” (Personification.)

“Why do the authors use personification? What do they want us to understand about the sun?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to understand that personifying the sun helps the reader understand how violent and destructive the heat in Malawi was.)

- If productive, cue students to expand or elaborate on their answers:

“Can you say more about that?”

- Say:

“What is another simpler way to say ‘the sun rose angry and showed no mercy on the seedlings that had survived’?” (Responses will vary, but look for responses that recognize that this sentence means that the sun was too hot for the plants.)

“Let’s imagine what this looks like. On your note-catchers, sketch a drawing of a sun that rose angry in the sky and showed no mercy on the seedlings that had survived.” 

- After one minute, invite students to share their drawings with a partner.

- Point out that these chunks alone already produce a complete sentence, although there is still another chunk left. If time allows, consider asking students to guess what extra information might be added to the beginning of this sentence.

With no rain,

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **With no rain,**

- Underline With no rain, in green, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 

- Say:

“What does this chunk tell us?” (Responses will vary.)

“If there had been rain, what would have been different?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to understand that the sun would have been less harsh if there had been rain.)

- Remind students that the sentence already was a complete sentence without this chunk.

- Say:

“Why is this chunk here? What does this chunk add to the sentence?” (It adds extra information; it provides critical context by explaining the source of the drought.)

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Display the sentence frames:

> **With no goals scored, the team \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**
>
> **With no money to buy a snack, Elisa \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**
>
> **With no time left in class, the teacher \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Complete these frames with your partners, using your own words. If you want, you can also write answers on your note-catchers.” 

With no rain, the sun rose angry in the sky each morning and showed no mercy on the seedlings that had survived.

Reconstruct

- Point to and read aloud the entire sentence on display: **<u>With no rain,</u> the sun rose angry in the sky each morning and showed no mercy on the seedlings that had survived.**

- Drawn students’ attention to the parts in green: With no rain, and on the seedlings that had survived.

- Say:

“Look at the parts underlined in green. These are prepositional phrases. What happens if we remove these parts?” (The sentence becomes “the sun rose angry in the sky each morning and showed no mercy.”)

“Does the sentence still make sense? Does its core meaning remain the same?” (Yes, but the prepositions add important information.)

“What other questions can we ask that will help us understand this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question, how can design thinking help solve a critical problem?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to understand that this sentence helps illustrate just how critical this problem is, making a solution seem even more necessary.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

> **With no \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, William’s family \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

prepositional phrase predicate

> (preposition phrase + subject + predicate)

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use this frame to talk about something William’s family does not have and how this affects something in their lives. Think about how this connects to a critical problem in the text. Use your own words with your partners.”

- Give students one minute to record answers on their note-catchers, then invite students to share answers. 

- Tell students that posting the chunks in language categories will help them use the language again for future speaking and writing tasks.

- Say and call on volunteers:

“Now take each chunk and post it to the appropriate Language Chunk Wall. You can refer to these chunks again as you speak and write.”
