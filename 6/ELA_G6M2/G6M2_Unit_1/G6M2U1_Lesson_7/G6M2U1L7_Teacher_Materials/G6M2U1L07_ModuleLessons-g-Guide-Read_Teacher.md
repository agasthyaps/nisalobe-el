**Purpose and Notes**

- The purpose of this close read is for students to use a range of strategies to determine the technical, connotative, and figurative meanings of unfamiliar words. Students will also identify the main idea of each section of the text to determine the central idea of the entire article.

- The vocabulary questions in this close read have been designed to reinforce the strategies introduced in previous lessons. Encourage students to make these connections and to use a wide range of strategies to understand key words and phrases.

- Continue to use discussion protocols (e.g., Think-Pair-Share, Conversation Cues, and total participation techniques) to engage all students in collaborative discussion about the text.

<td>Read from “When William Kamkwamba . . . ”<br />
to “ . . . he could help.”</td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Focus on the last sentence of the first paragraph.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask, “Why is there a word in Chichewa invented specifically to mean ‘great hunger for meat’?” (Because meat was so rare, Malawians were constantly hungry for it.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Reread this sentence from the third paragraph: “His family was desolate.” Make a chart breaking <strong>desolate</strong> into three parts (<strong>de</strong> - <strong>solare</strong> - <strong>ate</strong>). Explain that the Latin prefix <strong>de-</strong> can mean totally or all the way; <strong>solare</strong> means alone, as in solo; <strong>-ate</strong> makes a word an adjective.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ask, “Use what you know about these word parts to explain what <strong>desolate</strong> might mean in your own words.” (Completely and totally alone.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask, “How does our definition apply in the context of the article?” (William’s family and the rest of Malawi were completely and totally without help to guard against the famine.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask, “Why doesn’t the author use the word <strong>alone</strong>? Why might the author have chosen <strong>desolate</strong> instead?” (<strong>Desolate</strong> has a stronger negative connotation. It emphasizes the direness of the situation.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask, “How does this sentence better help you understand this section?” (It shows how bad the situation was and explains why William felt compelled to find a solution.)</p></li>
<li><p>Invite students to orally state the main idea of this section in their own words, then record the strongest response on their note-catcher. (Food was already hard to come by in Malawi before a famine hit and led to mass starvation.)</p></li>

<td><ul>
<li><p>Point to the subheading “Music to Pedal By.” Ask, “What is this text feature called?” (A subheading.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask, “What is the purpose of a subheading?” (To organize a text into smaller chunks; to show how all of the information in a section is alike; to hint at the main idea of a section.)</p></li>
<li><p>Explain that the word <em>by</em> in this context means to do something alongside or with the help of something else.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask, “How does this subheading relate to the events described in this section?” (The bike is generating enough electricity to power a radio. The boys now have music to play alongside or to enjoy as they ride the bike.)</p></li>
<li><p>Focus students on this sentence: “Although he knew little English, he figured out from diagrams how water wheels and electromagnets produce electricity; how batteries yield direct current; how magnets concocted from everyday objects make alternating current.”</p></li>
<li><p>Point to the word <strong>concocted</strong>. Make a chart breaking <strong>concoct</strong> into three parts (<strong>con</strong> - <strong>coct</strong> - <strong>ed</strong>). Explain that the Latin root <strong>con</strong>- means <em>together with</em>; the Latin root <strong>coct</strong> means <em>cooked</em>; and -<strong>ed</strong> makes a verb past tense.</p></li>
<li><p>Say, “Use what you know about these word parts. Share with a partner what you think <strong>concocted</strong> means in your own words.” (Cooked together.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask, “How does our definition apply in the context of the article?” (William had to be resourceful and “cook up” or devise his own tools and machines from everyday objects he found.)</p></li>
<li><p>Focus students on this sentence: “‘With that success,’ William wrote, ‘I started planning for an even bigger windmill.’”</p></li>
<li><p>Ask, “This sentence refers to an event in the past and another yet to come. What is ‘that success’ referring to?” (The small test windmill he built.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask, “What prediction can you make about what William will do next based on the second part of the sentence?” (He will start building a larger windmill to pump water to the fields.)</p></li>
<li><p>Invite students to orally state the main idea of this section in their own words, then record the strongest response on their note-catcher.<br />
(By tinkering with everyday objects, William discovered that he could generate electricity.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask, “How does the main idea we identified relate to the subheading?” (The subheading is a shorter version of the main idea; it hints at the main idea before the audience begins reading the section.)</p></li>

<li><p>Focus students on this sentence: “Months later, he had finally collected all the pieces—except the dynamo he needed for a generator.”</p></li>
<li><p>Invite students to use their finger to cover up the introductory phrase “Months later” at the beginning of the sentence.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask, “Does this sentence still make sense if the author had left out this phrase?” (Yes, it’s still a complete and coherent sentence.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask, “What information does this phrase add that the author thought the reader needed to hear?” (It shows that the process of gathering materials took a long time.)</p></li>
<li><p>Invite students to orally state the main idea of this section in their own words, then record the strongest response on their note-catcher. (William worked hard to collect all the materials he needed for the windmill.)</p></li>
<li><p>Point out that the subheading for this section does not match well with the main idea of the section.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask, “Pretend you are the editor giving feedback to the author. Can you suggest a subheading that better hints to the main idea of this section?” (Answers will vary. For example, “Garbage Collector.”)</p></li>

<td><ul>
<li><p>Focus students on this sentence: “William answers, ‘Electric wind. I told you I wasn’t mad!’”</p></li>
<li><p>Ask, “How does this sentence relate to the subheading?” (The subheading shows how the viewers reacted to the windmill. This sentence shows William’s response to the viewers.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask, “What can we infer about how William feels in this scene?” (He feels proud because his windmill was a success but also because he proved his doubters wrong.)</p></li>
<li><p>Focus students on this sentence: “It was his resourcefulness, confidence, and persistence.”</p></li>
<li><p>Ask, “Which habits of character listed on our anchor charts are similar to the attributes listed here? Explain the correlation.” (<em>Perseverance</em> is a synonym for <strong>persistence</strong>; both require pushing through challenges and not giving up. Initiative is similar to resourcefulness; both require being clever, careful, and organized to get a job done.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask, “What is the connotation of <strong>resourcefulness</strong>, <strong>confidence</strong>, and <strong>persistence</strong>? How do you know?” (Positive because they are admirable qualities that most people strive towards.)</p></li>
<li><p>Invite students to orally state the main idea of this section in their own words, then record the strongest response on their note-catcher. (The boys successfully constructed the windmill and got it working to generate electricity.)</p></li>

<li><p>Focus students on this sentence: “His mother says, William ‘saved his family from destruction.’”</p></li>
<li><p>Remind students that earlier they noted that the Latin prefix <strong>de</strong>- can mean totally or all the way. Explain that it more commonly means <em>un-</em> as in <strong>dehumidify</strong>, <strong>decompose</strong>, or <strong>deforestation</strong>. Separate destruction into three word parts: <strong>de</strong>-, <strong>struct</strong>, and -<strong>ion</strong>. Explain that the root word <em>struct</em> comes from the Latin word <strong>struere</strong> meaning to build. Explain that -<strong>ion</strong> means state of, result of.</p></li>
<li><p>Say, “Use what you know about these word parts. Share with a partner what you think <strong>destruction</strong> means in your own words.” (The result of being unbuilt; the state of being torn down.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask, “How does this sentence better help you understand this section?” (It shows that William’s windmill was critical to his family’s survival. It was no small feat.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask, “How did William’s windmill save his family from destruction?” (He was able to drill a well to provide fresh drinking water and irrigation for his village.)</p></li>
<li><p>Focus students on the last sentence of the article: <strong>“Thanks to William’s windmill, change is in the air for the people of Malawi.”</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Explain that this sentence makes for a clever ending because it has literal and figurative meanings.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask, “What is the figurative meaning of the phrase ‘in the air’? What do people mean when they say something is ‘in the air’?” (Something that is felt to be present or all around.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask, “In what way is change <u>literally</u> in the air for the people of Malawi?” (The air or wind powering the windmill is producing electricity that is lighting their homes, irrigating their fields, and pumping water up from the well. The air is changing their lives in ways necessary for survival.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask, “How does this sentence better help you understand this section?” (It shows that William’s windmill had far-reaching effects, beyond just his family or village.)</p></li>
<li><p>Invite students to orally state the main idea of this section in their own words, then record the strongest response on their note-catcher. (William’s windmill helped his community to get water and electricity. His work gained international attention, which he used to help other villages like his own.)</p></li>
