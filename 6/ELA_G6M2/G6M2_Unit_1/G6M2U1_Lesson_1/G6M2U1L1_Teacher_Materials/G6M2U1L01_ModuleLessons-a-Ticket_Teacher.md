(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, read the learning targets. Then, answer the prompts below.

1.  What does it mean to make an inference?

To draw a conclusion from given evidence and one’s background knowledge.

2.  Read the following scenario: Your best friend is opening the gift you gave her for her birthday. She looks inside the box and a smile spreads across her face. She looks up at you with a tear in her eye, and whispers, “Thank you.”

What inference might you draw from the scenario described? What evidence led to your inference?

Answers will vary. Sample student response: I would infer that my best friend is very happy with the gift because she is smiling and thankful. I would also infer that it is a very meaningful or sentimental gift because her tears indicate that she is touched. Her whispered response indicates that she is almost speechless.
