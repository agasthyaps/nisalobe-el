![](media/image1.png) Guiding Questions and Big Ideas

How can design thinking help solve a critical problem?

- *Design thinking is a scientific and systematic practice of inquiry that allows for creativity and innovation.*

- *Design thinking requires scientists to identify and research problems, build prototypes, test and evaluate solutions, and redesign as needed.*

What habits of character can help solve a critical problem to contribute to a better community?

- *Effective learners demonstrate perseverance when they research, build prototypes, reflect, and revise.*

- *Ethical people contribute to a better world by applying their learning to help one’s school, community, and the environment.*

What will your student be doing at school?

At the beginning of Unit 1, students are introduced to the module topic, Critical Problems and Design Solutions, and the module’s anchor text, *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* (Young Readers Edition). This text tells the story of William Kamkwamba. In the small village in Malawi, Africa, where he lives with his parents and sisters, William spends hours rereading old science textbooks in the school library or taking apart radios to see how their parts work together. When William’s community is devastated by a drought and famine, William’s problems become more critical and his questions more complicated: *How can we survive?* William builds a windmill to bring electricity to his home and to help his family pump water to their crops.

As students follow William’s story, they learn about design thinking and the process people use when solving complicated problems. In Unit 1 students learn about the famine and the problems William and his community face as a result. Students learn about and analyze the different methods the authors use to introduce and develop William as a key figure in the text, such as a character’s inner thoughts, description, dialogue, examples, anecdote (a short and interesting story), and allusion (a reference to a different text, person or event). By gaining deeper understanding of William, students will find more ways to relate to him and admire his perseverance and resilience.

In Unit 1 students analyze the kind of person William is to be able to more deeply understand his actions. During this unit, students will closely examine language to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words and phrases using a variety of strategies. Students analyze figurative language, such as simile, metaphor, and hyperbole, is used to emphasize and draw attention to the key ideas in text.

In this unit, students analyze text structures, such as cause and effect or problem and solution, to figure out how individual sentences, paragraphs, or entire chapters function together to provide key information to the reader. At the end of this unit students participate in a collaborative discussion about these important prompts that are central to the module topic: What critical problems does William face? What makes them critical?

Central to the EL Education curriculum is a focus on “habits of character” and social-emotional learning. Students work to become effective learners, developing mindsets and skills for success in college, career, and life (e.g., initiative, responsibility, perseverance, collaboration); work to become ethical people, treating others well and standing up for what is right (e.g., empathy, integrity, respect, compassion); and work to contribute to a better world, putting their learning to use to improve communities (e.g., citizenship, service).

In this unit, students work to become effective learners by showing responsibility with on-time completion of reading tasks. They work to become effective learners by showing perseverance as they read large portions of the text. Students work to become ethical people by showing empathy towards the plight of the Malawians suffering from the famine as described in the text. They show compassion and respect towards their classmates as the text brings up personal connections and reflections that may be difficult for others to share.

How can you support your student at home?

Watch or read local and global news with your student. Identify critical problems presented in the news outlets. Discuss what makes the problems critical. Promote empathy and compassion through conversations regarding what is happening in the world and how these events affect human kind.

Reread a favorite family text with your student. Talk about how the key individual in the text is introduced.

Questions to consider:

- Does the writer introduce the key individual by telling a brief story involving the key individual?

- Does the writer introduce the key individual through description?

- Does the writer introduce the key individual through dialogue with another individual in the text?

- Does the writer introduce the main figure by providing an example of something the figure has done?

Read *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* (Young Readers Edition) with your student as he/she is assigned homework. Ask your student to summarize and share the central idea of each chapter assigned for homework reading.

Play logic-based games with your student that requires him/her to apply evidence in order to reach a logic-based conclusion.

Unit 1: Homework

In Lessons 2–15, homework handouts focus on determining central ideas, analyzing how William is introduced and developed, identifying the meaning of unknown words, writing chapter summaries, and analyzing text structure. These are all literacy skills students learn during class; therefore, homework is designed to help students practice and apply skills they’ve already learned.

**Anchor Text reading:** Time limitations do not always allow for students to read entire chapters of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* during class; therefore, students should preread the next chapter for homework the night before it is studied in class. Reading from the anchor text will be balanced with independent research reading, which is used to deepen students’ background knowledge about the module topic.

**Research reading:** Your student is expected to independently research the topic of study in this module, Critical Problems and Design Solutions, by reading topic-related books of his or her choice. Research reading will be assigned on evenings when students are not already reading the anchor text. Students will be expected to read for approximately 20 minutes each day and respond to a prompt of choice in the front of the independent reading journal.

**Choice reading:** If your student would also like to independently read and respond to a book of free choice, he or she may use the back of the independent reading journal.

Independent Reading

**Directions:** Remember to record responses to research reading in the front of your independent reading journal and responses to choice reading in the back. Try to choose a different prompt each time.

Record any new vocabulary in your vocabulary log. Underline vocabulary found during independent reading.

**Record:**

- Date

- Title and author of your reading book

- Pages you have read

- Prompt

- Response

**Example:**

<u>Date:</u> November 14

<u>Book Title and Author:</u> *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* (Young Readers Edition) by William Kamkwamba and Bryan Mealer

<u>Pages Read:</u> 114–127

<u>Prompt:</u> Explain a way in which you connect to the text.

<u>Response:</u> Khamba is dying, and based on the suggestions from Charity, William decides to leave Khamba in the woods to pass away peacefully. My family had a dog, Maxwell, for fifteen years. Towards Maxwell’s final days, he could not get up and walk. Maxwell did not eat. My sister and brother tried to pick Maxwell up in order to put him in the car and take him to the vet to be put to sleep and end his pain. Maxwell surprised everybody by biting my sister and brother. Maxwell did not bite. He was gentle and playful. One morning, my mom went to check on Maxwell and he had passed away. We were devastated. We knew the time was coming, but Maxwell was so dear to the family. When talking about Maxwell and his uncharacteristic moment of vicious biting, we muse that Maxwell knew where my sister and brother were trying to take him, but Maxwell wanted to be at home. My family’s situation with Maxwell makes me question William’s decision: Did William really leave Khamba in the forest for Khamba’s benefit or for his own? Maxwell wanted to pass away at home, and from the way Khamba looked at William as William walked away, I’m sure Khamba would have preferred the same.

**Consider using the following independent reading prompts.**[^1]

- How does this text add to your understanding of one of the guiding questions of the module?

- Which habits of character are demonstrated in the text? Explain.

- Which habits of character are NOT demonstrated in the text? Explain.

- Record two or three facts in your own words that you learned from the text.

- Summarize your research reading today in no more than five sentences.

- Explain the critical problem an individual in the text experiences.

- How does an individual in the text demonstrate design thinking?

- Explain how you connect to the text.

- Explain how the text connects to another text you’ve read.

- Explain how the text connects to something currently happening in the world.

- How is the design thinking process in the text similar to William’s process in *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* (Young Readers Edition)?

- How does the design thinking process in the text differ from William’s process in *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* (Young Readers Edition)?

- Choose one new word from your reading today and analyze it on a vocabulary square.

| **Definition in your own words**                  | **Synonyms (words with the same meaning)** |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Words with the same affix or root**             | **Sketch**                                 |
| **Translation in home language** (if appropriate) |                                            |

Vocabulary

**Directions:** In the classroom, you have been recording words from your texts in your vocabulary log. Throughout this unit, you have been research reading topic-related books at home to build your knowledge of critical problems and design solutions and recording words in your independent reading journal.

Choose a word from your research reading or from a text you’ve read in class and add the word to your vocabulary log. Try to choose a different word to add and to practice a different vocabulary strategy each time. For each word, be sure to add the following:

1.  The definition, or meaning, of the word

<!-- -->

12. The vocabulary strategy you used to figure out the meaning of the word

13. A sketch or diagram that helps you to better understand the meaning of the word

Record new vocabulary in vocabulary logs and mark academic vocabulary with a symbol, for example a star:

- Academic vocabulary: words you might find in informational texts on many different topics. For example, the words evidence and rationale are words that could be found in books on any topic.

- Domain-specific vocabulary: words about a particular topic. For example, the words tadpoles, frogspawn, and amphibian are some that would be found on the topic of frogs.

**Vocabulary Strategies**

As a reminder, the following are the vocabulary strategies we’ve been working on in class:

- Context: Read the sentence around the word.

- Look at the affixes for clues.

- Look at the root of the word for clues.

- Use a dictionary.

- Discuss the word with another person (after attempting some of the above strategies).

[^1]: Some of the prompts will not be appropriate for the text students are reading. Invite students to choose a prompt that works for the text they have just read.
