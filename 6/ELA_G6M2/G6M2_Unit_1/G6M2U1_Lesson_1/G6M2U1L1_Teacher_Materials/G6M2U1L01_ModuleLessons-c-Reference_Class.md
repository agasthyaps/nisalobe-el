Resource 3

“With a windmill, we’d finally release ourselves from the troubles of darkness and hunger. A windmill meant more than just power. It was freedom.”

Kamkwamba, William. *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* (Young Readers Edition). Puffin Books, 2015.

Resource 4

“William headed to the library, a small room with three walls of books from America and electric lights. Although he knew little English, he figured out from diagrams how water wheels and electromagnets produce electricity; how batteries yield direct current; how magnets concocted from everyday objects make alternating current. A natural mechanic, William powered a radio by connecting one to the dynamo on a bicycle. While he pedaled, his cousin Geoffrey danced to African reggae music.

‘Of course,’ he thought. ‘This is how spinning motion generates power!’”

Levinson, Cynthia. “William Kamkwamba’s Electric Wind.” *Faces Magazine*, vol. 28, no. 2, 2011, pp. 10–13.

Resource 5

“In my mind, I could picture the windmill I wanted to build. But before I attempted something so big, I wanted to experiment with a smaller model . . . I poked a hole through the center of the lid and nailed it to a bamboo pole, which I drove into the ground behind the kitchen. Right away, I realized the blades were too short to catch the wind. I needed to make them longer.”

Kamkwamba, William. *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* (Young Readers Edition). Puffin Books, 2015.

Resource 6

The engineering design process is a series of steps that engineers follow to come up with a solution to a problem. Many times the solution involves designing a product (like a machine or computer code) that meets certain criteria and/or accomplishes a certain task.
