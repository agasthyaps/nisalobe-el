5-Minute Mini Language Dive

RI.6.3, L.6.4, L.6.5

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

Down below, **the crowd cackled like hens.** (from page 2 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* by William Kamkwamba and Bryan Mealer)

**Lesson 1 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after launching the anchor text, *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, and reading the prologue aloud to students in Work Time C.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address RI.6.3, L.6.4, and L.6.5 by presenting clues about the community’s attitudes toward William, by using a word that may be new for some students (**cackled**), and by including a simile (**cackled like hens**).

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it features challenging vocabulary and an example of a simile.

- Transfer: Subject + verb + **like** + noun phrase = to generate and understand similes in preparation for related activities in the second half of Unit 1 and on the End of Unit 1 Assessment.

**Deconstruct**

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **Down below, <u>the crowd cackled like hens</u>**.

- Say:

“What is this sentence about?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **the crowd cackled like hens.**

- Draw students’ attention to the word **hens.**

“What is a hen?” (A female chicken.)

- Show students a picture of a hen to verify their understanding of the word’s meaning.

- Draw student attention to the word **cackled.**

- Say:

“Does anyone know what this word means?” (To laugh noisily; to make loud unpleasant sounds.)

“What part of speech do you think it is? How do you know?” (Verb; ends in -ed, describes something that a noun, crowd, is doing.)

- If students do not know what **cackled** means, say:

“What do you think cackled might mean? What is something that both a crowd of people and hens could do?” (Responses will vary.)

- Invite students to use dictionaries to verify their understanding of the word’s meaning. Note that some dictionaries, such as <http://eled.org/0174>, may provide multiple example sentences with the word **cackle**, illustrating its potential to describe both people and chickens or geese. If time allows, encourage student reflection on these examples. Help them recognize that the most effective similes use comparisons that are not only creative, but also sensible and familiar.

- Say:

“Can you show me what it sounds like for a crowd of people to cackle like hens? Let’s hear it!”

**Reconstruct**

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **Down below, <u>the crowd cackled like hens.</u>**

- Say:

“Can you figure out why the writers chose to compare people in the crowd to hens?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“What kind of figurative language is this an example of? We talked about this in Module 1.” (Simile; if helpful, before providing the answer, draw student attention to the word like as a clue.)

“What if we remove the simile? How is the sentence different if it says, ‘Down below, the crowd cackled’?” (This sentence no longer uses figurative language; it is less interesting; it evokes less of an image in the readers’ minds.)

- Say:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“What does this sentence tell us about William’s character?” (Responses to this question may include that it tells us that people in William’s community do not believe in him and his abilities.)

**Practice**

- Display the sentence frame:

> **On the other side of the classroom, the students whispered like**
>
> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

noun phrase

> (subject + verb + **like** + noun phrase)

- Say:

“Use this frame to create a simile that compares something in the classroom to something else. Be creative.”

  **On the other side of the classroom, <u>the students whispered</u>** like **<u>little mice</u>.**

  (subject + verb + **like** + noun phrase)
