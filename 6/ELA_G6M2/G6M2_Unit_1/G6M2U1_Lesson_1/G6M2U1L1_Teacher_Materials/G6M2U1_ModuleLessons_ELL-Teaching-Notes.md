English Language Learners: Grade 6: Module 2: Unit 1: Teaching Notes

Build Background: William Kamkwamba and Design Thinking

Teaching Notes for Unit 1

Prioritize Lessons for Classrooms with Many English Language Learners

To prepare for the mid-unit assessment, prioritize and expand instruction in Lesson 2, which provides multiple examples of how a key individual is introduced in a text or video, and in Lesson 4, during which students practice identifying central idea(s) of a text and supporting their answers with textual evidence. The Language Dives of Lessons 7 and 9 support reading abilities for students at all proficiency levels, though are particularly critical for ELLs, as these approaches accelerate language development through a close look at structure and vocabulary. Finally, Lesson 15 acquaints students, through a low-stakes text-based discussion, with a Fishbowl protocol that will be used again in the End of Unit 3 Assessment; practicing an interactive protocol outside of an assessment context equips ELLs with added confidence and preparedness.

Language Dives

In Lessons 7 and 9, students participate in Language Dives that use sentences from their anchor text, *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*. In Lesson 7, students analyze figurative language used by the authors to describe the drought in Malawi. In Lesson 9, students practice applying context clues to unknown words and identifying the relationship between an individual sentence and its surrounding chapter. A Language Dive empowers students to analyze, understand, and use the language of academic sentences, which often seems opaque to students. During a Language Dive, students slow down for 10–20 minutes to have a conversation about the meaning, purpose, and structure of a compelling sentence from a complex text, or from a learning target, checklist, or rubric included in the curriculum. Following the engaging deconstruct-reconstruct-practice routine of the Language Dive, students play with the smallest “chunks” of the sentence, interpreting them, rearranging them, or using them to talk about their own lives. As a result of paying close attention to how language works, all students begin to acquire the necessary facility with academic English, and ELLs foster their overall language ability. A consistent Language Dive routine is critical in helping all students learn how to decipher complex sentences and write their own.

Most Language Dives implicitly address a wide range of Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening, and Language standards. Once comfortable with Language Dives, supplement the focus standards in a particular Language Dive with additional standards to meet students’ needs. Note that the Rationale section of each Language Dive also identifies supporting standards that are explicitly addressed but are not the main focus of the Language Dive.

Note that the Language Dive Guides have been condensed in Module 2, as a way to reduce the amount of reading needed. Refer to the general best practices laid out in the Module 1 Language Dive guides.

Language Chunk Wall

Beginning in Module 2 and going forward, create a “Language Chunk Wall” to extend student capacity to use Language Dive structures. The Language Chunk Wall is an area in the classroom where students can display and categorize the academic phrases discussed in each Language Dive. At the end of each Language Dive, students are invited to place the Language Dive sentence chunk strips on the Language Chunk Wall into corresponding categories, such as “Nouns and noun phrases” or “Linking language.” See each Language Dive for suggested categories. Color-code each category for additional support. Examples: blue for nouns and subjects; purple for pronouns; red for predicates and verbs; yellow for adjectives; and green for adverbs, prepositions, and conjunctions. Students can then refer to the wall during subsequent speaking and writing tasks.

Mini Language Dives

Students have an opportunity to participate in Mini Language Dives beginning in Module 2, Unit 1. Mini Language Dives have the same overall purpose and follow the same general process as full Language Dives, but are condensed to 5 minutes, narrowing students’ attention on deconstructing the focus structure, reconstructing the sentence, and practicing the focus structure. Mini Language Dives give ELLs additional support in building language and literacy skills, as well as habits of mind. Mini Language Dives are most often optional and can be found in the corresponding lessons within this guide. When required for all students, Mini Language Dives are built into the body of the lesson in the Teacher Guide. In this unit, optional Mini Language Dives appear in Lessons 1, 3, and 5.

Diversity and Inclusion

Investigate the routines, practices, rituals, beliefs, norms, and experiences that are important to ELLs and their families. Integrate this background into the classroom as students engage with texts. Consider the values and narratives embedded in class texts and try to anticipate their relevance to ELLs. The Module 2 anchor text, *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, describes the incredible scientific achievements of a Malawian boy named William. While the text celebrates and uplifts William’s empathy, perseverance, and his successes, it also features detailed descriptions of the hardships surrounding William and community, namely a devastating drought and subsequent famine. Some chapters may be particularly upsetting for students; note warnings for these chapters in the Support All Students sections of each lesson. Foster inclusive action by creating space for students to express their feelings about sensitive issues or content embedded in the text(s), knowing that these discussions may help create equity, amplify student voices, or unearth trauma.

Additionally, when describing his childhood in a rural Malawi village, William occasionally positions his life as representative of African life overall. Although William’s intention is to present his experiences in Africa as he lived them, his descriptions of Africa may unintentionally reinforce stereotypes of the continent as homogeneous, comprised only of poor countries and communities. Refer to teacher notes throughout the lessons for ideas on how to help students construct a truer and more dynamic understanding of Africa in their minds. Be particularly sensitive to international students and ELLs from African regions, whose lived experiences may reflect or diverge from William’s in complicated or conflicting ways. Consult with a guidance counselor, school social worker, or ESL teacher for further investigation of diversity and inclusion.

Conversation Cues

Encourage productive and equitable conversation with Conversation Cues, which are questions to ask students that help achieve four goals:

- (Goal 1) encourage all students to talk and be understood;

- (Goal 2) listen carefully to one another and seek to understand;

- (Goal 3) deepen thinking; and

- (Goal 4) think with others to expand the conversation (adapted from Michaels, Sarah, and Cathy O’Connor. *Talk Science Primer*. TERC, 2012. http://inquiryproject.terc.edu/shared/pd/TalkScience_Primer.pdf. Based on Chapin, S., O’Connor, C., and N. Anderson. \[2009\]. *Classroom Discussions: Using Math Talk to Help Students Learn*, Grades K–6. Second Edition. Math Solutions Publications).

Refer to the Tools Page (http://eled.org/tools) for the complete set of cues. For ELLs, Conversation Cues are especially critical because they improve language processing abilities and increase engagement and participation.

Strategic Grouping

Students work in pairs and small groups to analyze texts and prepare for text-based discussions. While reading the anchor text in class, students can read independently, in pairs or small groups, or as a full class. In earlier lessons, as students begin the anchor text, match ELLs with a partner who has greater language proficiency. The conversations and reading support that occur as a result of such strategic pairing will greatly serve the language development of both partners. In later lessons, cultivate ELLs’ autonomy and flexibility by encouraging them to vary their reading habits.

Text-Based Discussions

In Lesson 15, students will participate in a text-based discussion, during which they will have the opportunity to explore what makes a problem critical, using William’s problems in the text as examples. In preparation for the discussion, students, in Lesson 13, watch a video that models the Fishbowl protocol that they will use during the end of unit assessment and identify ways in which this protocol differs from the Socratic Seminar of Module 1. Also in Lesson 13, students are introduced to a problem-solution note-catcher, which they complete collaboratively and which they will use during the text-based discussion. This preparatory lesson supports ELLs by introducing a visual model, drawing from students’ knowledge of a similar protocol, and providing time to consolidate and organize ideas. Then, in Lesson 14, students review discussion norms for the following lesson’s discussion, supporting ELLs by clearly delineating expectations. After the text-based discussion in Lesson 15, students are given time to reflect on the ways in which they demonstrated the discussion norms in their own comments during the discussion, increasing students’ awareness of their own abilities and facilitating opportunities for celebration. Although this text-based discussion is formally assessed, the Fishbowl protocol introduced in the discussion is used again in the End of Unit 3 Assessment; familiarity with the protocol’s formatting and expectations may help relieve nerves for ELLs, for whom class-wide speaking activities may feel particularly intimidating.

Differentiated Materials

Differentiated materials are available for ELLs and other students who would benefit from an increased level of support. These resources have been modified for the purposes of creating accessibility to content and concepts and supporting language development. Depending upon the task being carried out with a material, images, selected response options, answer banks, sentence frames, or model responses have been embedded to guide students’ thinking without compromising a focus on standards and the skills that students are developing and applying to meet them.

Celebration

Celebrate the courage, enthusiasm, diversity, and bilingual assets that ELLs bring to the classroom. Additionally, students can celebrate their successful attempts at communication and their ability to extend and enhance the discussions.
