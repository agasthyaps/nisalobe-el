Synopsis: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, Chapter 6

**Name:** **Date:**

- William does not do well on his placement exams and is placed in Kachokolo, one of the worst schools in the area.

- The famine continues. Maize prices sky rocket.

- Several of William’s mother’s *zigumu* cakes are stolen in the chaos of the crowd around her stand. With the decrease of *zigumu* cake sales, food at the Kamkwamba house becomes more scarce.

- William looks forward to school instead of being hungry at home.

- William does not have money for school books, so he shares with Gilbert.

- The effects of hunger reach the classroom as well. William and his classmates are less eager to raise their hands and compete to be the first to answer the teacher correctly.

- Mister Phiri, the school principal, makes an announcement that all students who have not paid their school fees will not be permitted to attend school.

- William speaks to his father about the school fees and is informed that there is no money. William cannot attend school.

- The next day, Gilbert informs William that almost all the other students dropped out as well.
