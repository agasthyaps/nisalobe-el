Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.6.3 – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket for which they reread an excerpt of chapter 5 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* and identify the method the authors use for developing key individuals and what can be inferred about the individuals from that method.

- RI.6.3 – Work Time A: After students read chapter 6 of the text, they use their note-catchers to capture ideas about how the authors develop William as a key individual in the text.

- RI.6.4 – Work Time B: Students participate in a Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol to determine the figurative meanings of words as they are used in chapter 6 of the text.

- L.6.5 – Work Time B: Students participate in a Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol to interpret figures of speech in chapter 6 of the text

- RI.6.1 – Closing and Assessment A: During a QuickWrite, students use textual evidence from chapter 6 of the text to support their analysis of the chapter’s central idea(s).

- RI.6.2 – Closing and Assessment A: Students work independently to write an effective summary of chapter 6 of the text.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Challenge students to gather more examples of figurative language in other chapters of the anchor text and conduct a student-led version of the activity in Work Time B.

- Create affirmation posters, one per student, and have students circulate around the room, similar to a Chalk Talk, and write positive comments about their peers using figurative language (e.g., “Your smile is as warm as the sun!” \[simile\] “My heart sings when you’re around!” \[personification\]).

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students finished reading chapter 5 and participated in a Language Dive to examine how a single sentence can develop a key individual in a text.

Support All Students

- Note that there is a differentiated version of the entrance ticket used in Opening A in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Like Chapter 2, Chapter 6 may be read with slightly less attention to detail without disrupting students’ understanding of the story and its connection to the module guiding questions. If students are experiencing burnout or feeling overwhelmed, encourage them to practice reading for gist (i.e., fewer students are able to attend school; William wants to attend school and cannot afford it). Invite students to think critically about this central idea of the chapter and connect it to other chapters they have read or experiences they have had.

- Figurative language is a broad topic encompassing many different writing techniques. Provide a simple handout listing just the most common techniques (simile, metaphor, personification, hyperbole, alliteration) and clear examples of each. To further support student understanding, invite ELLs to share examples of common figures of speech in their home languages. ▲

- Because figurative language is very abstract, students need concrete representations of simile and metaphor, their purpose, and their uses. Consider representing the simile and metaphors through images of both their literal and figurative meanings side by side. Students can discuss the difference to further facilitate comprehension.

- For summary writing during Closing and Assessment A, provide students with an individual checklist containing the criteria from the Criteria for an Effective Summary anchor chart. Instruct students to check off each criterion as they implement it. For increased visualization, color-code elements of the checklist and also provide colored pencils or highlighters for students to mark in their writing.

- To support ELLs, this lesson facilitates opportunities for students to deepen their understanding of figurative language in *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*. Through a Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol that allows processing time and promotes equitable discussion, students collaborate to identify the type of figurative language used in select sentences in the text.

- ELLs may find it challenging to produce an independent summary of chapter 6 during the QuickWrite of Closing and Assessment A. If useful, provide sentence frames to support students’ writing.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.2, 6.I.B.6, 6.II.A.1, 6.II.B.4, and 6.II.C.6.

Assessment Guidance

- During Work Time B, students review figurative language terms that were introduced in Module 1. Make sure that, beyond identifying examples of the terms, students understand how and why authors use figurative language as a tool to emphasize ideas, develop individuals, and add interest through beautiful language.

- Note that chapter 7 of the anchor text will not be read due to time constraints and concerns about the sensitive nature of its content. Assure students that skipping this chapter will not impede their success on future assessments. Consider reading the gist provided on the Gist anchor chart: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* so they know what occurs in the text without exposing them to the troubling details of the chapter.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue examining the role of figurative language in the text and how it contributes to the text’s central idea. Students will also expand their language skills by determining the connotative meaning of different words.

- Students will also share their initial reactions to and learning from their Independent Research Reading task.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.6.3 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 10** or the optional **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 10** ▲. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 10 (example for teacher reference)** for possible responses.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- During Opening A, invite students who need heavier support to use Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 10 ▲. This resource offers sentence frames and model answers, reducing the amount of independent writing students are expected to complete.

Work Time

A. Read *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, Chapter 6 – RI.6.3 (20 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Read chapter 6 of the **text**, using **Text Guide: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students who are ready to read independently or in small groups should be released to this independence. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Refer to the following resources as appropriate to support this section of the lesson: **Gist anchor chart: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*** **(example for teacher reference)**, **vocabulary logs**, **chapter synopsis**, and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Gist: William is excited to start school but is assigned to the worst school in the area. It doesn’t matter, though, because he can’t afford the school fees and has to drop out.

- Turn and Talk:

“Which habits of character did you practice as you read this excerpt? Why?” (Student responses will vary, but may include empathy and compassion for the hunger William is feeling all of the time, and for the conditions at the school.)

- Repeated routine: Using strategic groupings, invite students to work with their peers to complete the next row of their **Analyze Key Individual: William note-catcher**. Refer to the **Analyze Key Individual: William note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** as necessary. Use a total participation technique to review and correct any misunderstandings before moving on.

- Ensure that students notice that in chapter 6 the author uses rich *dialogue* to convey that even in the midst of hardship, William still finds and uses humor, engaging in playful banter with Gilbert, and doesn’t let the difficult circumstances change his happy and fun personality.

- Remind students that they learned about dialogue in Lesson 2 when they viewed the TED Talk. Remind them or ask a student to share the definition of dialogue and ensure they can point out instances of dialogue in the chapter as they share their responses.

- Use a total participation technique to review and correct any misunderstandings before moving on and to update the **Author’s Methods anchor chart**. Refer to the **Author’s Methods anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- Distribute one or two sentences from the Figurative Language Review: Chapter 6 resource to students who finish reading chapter 6 early. Invite these students to annotate the sentences with small drawings that represent the meaning of the sentence. These images can be shared with students who need heavier support during Work Time B.

For Heavier Support

N/A

Work Time

B. Analyze Figurative Language – L.6.5 (15 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can interpret figurative language and use connotations to determine meaning in the text.”

- Explain that students will achieve this learning target while engaging in the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol. The purpose of this particular protocol is to share information and gain multiple perspectives through partner interaction.

- Read aloud and ensure students understand the directions for back-to-back and face-to-face. (Refer to the **Classroom Protocols document**.)

- Use the **Figurative Language Review: Chapter 6 (for teacher reference)** to guide students through the protocol. Remind students that they worked with these terms in Module 1. Their goal today is to review the terms but also build understanding of how the authors use these tools to add meaning and develop key individuals and ideas.

- Circulate and monitor student responses. Make note of students who might need support and check in with them moving forward. Give additional time and attention to any terms with which students struggle.

- Turn and Talk:

“How does the author’s use of figurative language help to develop a key idea of this chapter?” (Figurative language is used to emphasize and draw attention to the key ideas, such as William’s extreme disappointment in being assigned to Kachokolo and the increasingly dire situation caused by the famine.)

- Cue students to clarify their answers as needed:

“So do you mean \_\_\_\_\_\_?”

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Closing and Assessment

A. QuickWrite: Summarize Chapter 6 – RI.6.2 (5 minutes)

- Transition students by explaining that the key ideas they have identified are examples of the essential information that should be included in a summary of the chapter.

- Remind students that they have practiced summary writing several times in this unit and the previous module. Explain that they will now independently write a summary of chapter 6 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*. Encourage students to reference the **Criteria for an Effective Summary anchor chart** as needed.

- Distribute **QuickWrite: Summarize Chapter 6** handout, and direct students to begin. Refocus whole group after 4 minutes.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- During the QuickWrite of Closing and Assessment A, strategically pair students who need lighter support with those who need heavier support. Students who need lighter support can further their own learning by elucidating key ideas and offering writing support to their partners.

For Heavier Support

- Provide additional support during the QuickWrite by hosting a “think-aloud.” In a small group of students who need the heaviest support, write a model summary and display it. Think aloud to model the process, in real time. Invite students to take notes and recall the questions asked during the think-aloud. Allow these students to complete the summary after class or as homework, using the think-aloud as a model for their own internal writing process. Check in with these students later to invite reflections on this task.

Homework

A. Analyze Author Methods and Central Idea

- Students complete **Homework: Analyze Author Methods and Central Idea: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, **Chapter 5**.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
