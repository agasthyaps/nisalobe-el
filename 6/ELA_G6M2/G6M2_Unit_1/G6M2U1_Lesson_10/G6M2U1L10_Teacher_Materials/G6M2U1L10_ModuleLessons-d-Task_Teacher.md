Figurative Language Review: Chapter 6

RI.6.4, L.6.5

(For Teacher Reference)

Students will review figurative language while engaging in the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol. The purpose of this particular protocol is to share information and gain multiple perspectives through partner interaction.

**Consider displaying the questions as they are asked to aid in comprehension.**

- Position partners back-to-back.

- Ask one question about figurative language and connotations from the list below. Repeat the question to aid listening comprehension.

- Allow time for students to think before giving the signal for students to turn front-to-front with their partner.

- Have students listen carefully as each partner shares.

- Give the signal for students to return to the back-to-back position.

- Repeat for each of the questions listed below.

1.  **Part A**

True or false: This sentence demonstrates **hyperbole**: “My heart dropped into my stomach” (101). Explain your thinking.

True. Hyperbole is an over exaggeration. In this case, William’s heart did not literally move into his stomach. He is exaggerating the feelings of disappointment and anxiety he experienced from finding out that he was assigned to one of the worst schools in the area.

**Part B**

How does this hyperbole add to your understanding of how William feels?

It shows just how devastated William felt at being assigned to Kachokolo. The hyperbole emphasizes that he was more than just sad or disappointed; he had a physical reaction to the news.

1.  **Part A**

True or false: This sentence demonstrates **metaphor**: “I was going to Kachokolo because my grades stunk” (101). Explain your thinking.

False. Metaphor shows a comparison between two unlike objects. Instead, this sentence uses personification. Personification is giving human characteristics to nonhuman things. In this case grades can’t literally give off an odor.

**Part B**

Why did the authors choose the word **stunk** in this metaphor? Consider connotation.

Stunk has a strong negative connotation, which emphasizes how disappointed William was in his grades. Alternative adjectives, such as “bad” or “disappointing,” do not have as strong a connotation.

2.  **Part A**

In the following sentence, the author uses the word **lucky** to describe the working men: “. . . I watched tractors plowing a field and the few **lucky** men with jobs enjoying a day’s work” (106). What connotation does the word **lucky** have?

Lucky has a positive connotation.

**Part B**

Why did the authors choose this word to describe the field workers?

The authors chose a word with a positive connotation to describe the workers because during the famine, people were desperate to work and earn money to buy food. Anyone who could find work would be glad for the opportunity and would feel lucky. Getting work would be considered a positive, so the authors chose a word with a matching connotation.

3.  **Part A**

True or false: This sentence demonstrates **metaphor**: “‘This is what starving people look like,’ I thought. ‘They look like ghosts’” (112). Explain your thinking.

False. A metaphor compares two unlike objects. In this case, the authors use simile which compares two objects, often using the words “like” or “as.” The starving people are being compared to ghosts using the word “like.”

**Part B**

How does this simile add to your understanding of the scenario William is describing?

The simile helps the reader to visualize the people starving from the famine. Using the comparison to “ghosts” also hints that many people will die.
