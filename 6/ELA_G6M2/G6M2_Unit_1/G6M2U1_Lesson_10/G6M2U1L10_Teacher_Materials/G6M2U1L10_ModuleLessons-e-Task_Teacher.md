Sample student response: Chapter 6 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* begins with William looking forward to starting school. He says, “I was certain that I was experiencing the greatest moment of my life” (106). But his journey toward his education was not a smooth one. A central idea conveyed by this chapter is that he was challenged by a series of difficult events that impacted his dream. First, he discovers that his grades weren’t high enough to earn him a spot in one of the schools with a strong science program. Instead, he attends the worst school in the area with few books and holes in the roof. Worse yet, his family doesn’t have enough money for tuition, so he has to drop out of school after two weeks.
