- Maize is extremely important for Malawians. Growing maize is difficult, takes the whole year, and requires every member of William’s family to help. Maize is used to make *nsima*, a doughy porridge eaten with every meal.

- In July, William and Geoffrey collect the old maize stalks and burn them.

- Ridges are made in the dirt by using a hoe.

- December brings the rainy season, when seeds can be planted.

- When seedlings push through the ground, the seedlings receive a spoonful of fertilizer.

- In December 2000, the Malawian government raises the prices of fertilizer, and William’s family cannot purchase any fertilizer.

- Heavy rains pummel Malawi, and the country floods.

- The rains cease, and the drought begins.

- By May, half of the Kamkwamba maize crop is scorched.

- Harvest produces only five bags of maize.
