Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Work Time A: Students complete the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment. They read chapter 4 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* and then answer selected response questions about the central idea(s) of the chapter, the meaning of words as they are used in the chapter, and the methods that the authors use to further the reader’s understanding of William. (RI.6.1, RI.6.2, RI.6.3, RI.6.4, RI.6.10, L.6.4a)

- Students focus on working to become effective learners by demonstrating perseverance during the mid-unit assessment. Prompt students’ perseverance by reminding them that assessments are meant to inform instruction. Use assessment data to make choices about what should be retaught and how to adjust the pacing. Encourage students not to be afraid of mistakes; an accurate assessment is crucial for tailoring lessons to students’ needs.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Some students may not need extensive review of the assessment directions. Release them to begin working on the assessment while clarification is provided to other students who need more support.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the first half of this unit, students began reading *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, determining a central idea and key supporting details of chapters 1–3 from the text, summarizing what they read, and analyzing how the author develops William. This lesson continues those routines in an assessment.

Support All Students

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment.

- Some students may need the text read aloud before they work on the questions. Consider inviting students who require this support to sit in a group away from the rest of the students, so as not to be distracting.

- Applying reading skills and strategies to a new text, as required by the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment, will be especially challenging for some students, including ELLs. Remind students that the assessment text comes from *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, which has been the focus of their studies thus far; therefore, the setting, characters, and style are familiar to students at this point. ▲

- For some students, this assessment may require more than the 30 minutes allotted. Consider providing time over multiple days if necessary.

- To support ELLs, this lesson invites students to complete assessment tasks similar to the classroom tasks in Lessons 1-5. Students read chapter 4 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* and then answer selected response questions about the text. Although the chapter is new to students, students are already familiar with the text’s characters, setting, and style. Reading a chapter from a familiar text allows students to build upon their existing understanding of the text, rather than start from scratch to interpret something entirely new.

- ELLs may find it challenging to independently complete the mid-unit assessment without scaffolding. Point out that the mid-unit assessment is similar to the activities they have successfully completed in class. Encourage students to do their best, and assure them that they will continue learning together after the assessment.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.7, and 6.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- The Mid-Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Central Idea and Development of an Individual: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, Chapter 4 resources (student and teacher version) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback on this assessment, use the answer key and sample student responses (see Assessment Overview and Resources) to help complete students’ Track Progress recording forms.

- Using information from this assessment, students are tracking their long-term progress toward these anchor standards:

- R.1: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.

- R.4: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Interpret words and phrases as they are used in a text, including determining technical, connotative, and figurative meanings, and analyze how specific word choices shape meaning or tone.

- R.10: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Read and comprehend complex literary and informational texts independently and proficiently.

- L.4: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Determine or clarify the meaning of unknown and multiple-meaning words and phrases by using context clues, analyzing meaningful word parts, and consulting general and specialized reference materials, as appropriate.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive to analyze and interpret figurative language from chapter 4 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*. They will read an informational text about William Kamkwamba and determine a central idea conveyed in the text.

- Students’ Mid-Unit 1 Assessments will be returned in Lesson 12 with feedback.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 6**. Allow time for students to record their responses using their **Module 1 End of Unit 3 Assessment**.

- Circulate as students review their assessment feedback. Offer guidance and support as necessary.

- Once all students are ready, invite them to share their “stars” and “steps” with a partner. Remind students that everyone is working toward individual goals and that learning is about continued growth and development.

- Using a preferred classroom routine, collect or review the answers to **Homework: Analyze Vocabulary and Central Idea: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, **Chapter 3**. Refer to **Homework: Analyze Vocabulary and Central Idea: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, **Chapter 3 (answers for teacher reference)**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Mid-Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Central Idea and Development of an Individual: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, Chapter 4 (30 minutes)

- Direct students to retrieve their **text**. Distribute **Mid-Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Central Idea and Development of an Individual: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, **Chapter 4** and read the directions for each part of the assessment aloud as students follow along, reading silently. Answer clarifying questions.

- Tell students that for this assessment, they will independently read a new chapter in their anchor text. They will then answer selected response and short answer questions about the central idea(s) of the chapter, the meaning of words as they are used in the chapter, and the methods that the authors use to further the reader’s understanding of William.

- Make sure students understand the assessment directions; paraphrase some instructions, if needed. ▲ Answer students’ questions, but refrain from supplying answers to the assessment questions themselves.

- Direct students’ attention to the following anchor charts:

- **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart**

- **Strategies to Answer Selected Response Questions anchor chart**

- Remind students to refer to these anchor charts as they read the assessment text and answer the assessment questions.

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence. Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart** and review what perseverance looks and sounds like. Remind students that because they will be reading and answering questions independently for the assessment, they may need to practice perseverance.

- Invite students to begin the assessment.

- While they are taking the assessment, circulate to monitor and document their test-taking skills. Refer to **Synopsis: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, **Chapter 4 (for teacher reference)** as necessary, but do not share this handout with students to avoid compromising the integrity of the assessment.

- Give students specific, positive feedback on their completion of the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment. Refer to **Mid-Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Central Idea and Development of an Individual: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, **Chapter 4 (answers for teacher reference)** to assess.

For Lighter Support

- Before the assessment of Work Time A, underline key vocabulary in the assessment directions and prompt and read aloud together as a class to ensure that students understand each task included in the assessment. Invite students who need lighter support to restate or clarify information for students who need heavier support.

For Heavier Support

- Display a “map” of the assessment to reference while explaining directions to the mid-unit assessment. This will reduce ambiguity and give students a clearer picture of what they can expect so that they can better allocate their time and attentional resources. Provide students with colored pencils or highlighters so that they can mark up the “map” as needed. Example:

Read chapter 4. Then,

- Use context to determine a word’s meaning.

- Determine a central idea from the chapter.

- Locate evidence to support the central idea.

- Identify ways that the text develops William’s character.

- Use evidence to infer qualities of William’s character.

Closing and Assessment

A. Track Progress – RI.6.1 (10 minutes)

- Give students specific, positive feedback on their completion of the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment.

- Distribute **Track Progress folders**, **Track Progress: Read, Understand, and Explain New Text**, and **sticky notes**. Tell students the sticky notes are for them to find evidence of the following criteria:

- RI.6.1

- RI.6.4, L.6.4

- Guide students through completing the recording form.

- Invite students to reflect on their perseverance, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from chapter 4 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*. Provide ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Invite students who need lighter support to predict some of the questions that the Language Dive may ask. This will improve students’ metacognition and challenge their awareness of the most interesting or meaningful elements of the sentence.

For Heavier Support

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from chapter 4 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*. Provide ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Encourage students who need heavier support to independently reflect on this sentence and its meaning before the next lesson. Students may also wish to add any unknown vocabulary to their vocabulary logs.

Homework

A. Analyze Key Individual

- Students complete the row for chapter 4 on the **Analyze Key Individual: William note-catcher**.
