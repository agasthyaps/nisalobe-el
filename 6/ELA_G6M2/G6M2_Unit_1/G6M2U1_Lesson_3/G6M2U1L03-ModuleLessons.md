Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.6.1 – Work Time A: Students use evidence from chapter 1 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* to support their ideas about how the authors develop William as a key individual.

- RI.6.3 – Work Time A: After students complete chapter 1, they answer questions about the methods used by the writers to develop William as a key individual in the text and add to their Analyze Key Individual: William note-catchers.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time B: Students use evidence from the text to support their understanding of chapter 1’s central idea.

- RI.6.2 – Work Time B: Students locate recurrent details in chapter 1 and use these details to contribute to a Central Idea Visual that expresses a single central idea of the chapter.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- At several points throughout the text, Malawian characters are compared to animals due to their physical strength. For example, Phiri is said to be so strong that “no person or animal could beat him” (page 25) and William is said to play soccer “like a lion” (page 28). Consider encouraging students to think of other ways to describe the physical characteristics of the text’s characters.

- An optional Mini Language Dive, intended for use after students complete the chapter 1 excerpt in Work Time A in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- In this lesson students continue to analyze how William is introduced in chapter 1 of the text. To extend learning, invite students to analyze how individuals are introduced in other texts, for example texts of higher lexiles in the Recommended Texts and Other Resources. Students could also analyze how ideas influence William and other individuals in the text, and how William’s ideas and actions and the ideas and actions of others in the text influence events.

- In this lesson, students practice finding the central idea. To extend learning, invite students to practice finding the central idea in other texts, for example texts of higher lexiles in the Recommended Texts and Other Resources.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students read the first half of chapter 1; they will finish reading the chapter during Work Time A. They continue to analyze how William is introduced, illustrated, and elaborated in the text using their Analyze Key Individual: William note-catcher.

- Students practice identifying a central idea. Although this skill was introduced in Module 1, students practice finding the central idea in a new way during this lesson.

Support All Students

- Note that there is a differentiated version of the Entrance Ticket used in Opening A in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- On page 35, “fact and reason” are presented as alternatives to “mystery and hocus-pocus.” Be sensitive to the ways in which this may be upsetting to students of faith.

- Certain experiences, circumstances, or environments presented throughout the text may feel more familiar to some students than to others. For example, William’s struggles with learning English, presented at the end of the novel, may resonate with ELLs, and the text’s presentation of Malawi’s drought and famine may evoke emotions or memories for students from areas with similar environmental challenges or economic insecurity. Throughout Module 2, look for opportunities to lift up students’ experiences and connections to the text, but avoid compelling students to report these connections to the class or to serve as “representatives” of communities or groups much larger than they are. One way to do this is through regular journaling or small-group discussion activities, which use sentence frames to prompt all students to comment on some aspect of the text. These journal prompts, introduced for the first time during Closing and Assessment A of this lesson, are general enough to be answered by any student, but also provide a special outlet for ELLs and international students to explore personal connections if they choose to do so. ▲

- ELLs with lower decoding abilities may struggle to read at the same pace as their classmates. Support developing readers with as many options as possible, including having them following along, reading silently, during read-alouds or reading in a pair or small group of classmates. Make sure that quicker readers are aware of what to do if they finish reading early (e.g., add to their Analyze Key Individual: William note-catchers; return to the text and highlight what they consider to be the most important ideas), so that ELL students do not feel pressured to read more quickly than they are able to. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson facilitates opportunities for practice and repetition by inviting students to apply skills and strategies acquired in Module 1 to determine the central idea of chapter 1 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*. Additionally, a QuickWrite prompt during Closing and Assessment A invites students to describe what they are reminded of when they read about the Malawian community depicted in the anchor text. This exercise facilitates a private and low-stakes way for students to draw connections to the text’s setting, which may be especially meaningful for students whose home communities are more rural. An optional Mini Language Dive is also available to help students extract useful linguistic patterns from the text and practice them in their own writing.

- ELLs may find it challenging to interpret and describe patterns across details of the text during Work Time B. Carefully model for students the process of using recurring words, phrases, or ideas to generate a larger picture of a text’s central idea(s). Strategically group students into pairs for additional support during the scanning and highlighting activity. Help students recognize that this is a challenging and collaborative process that requires practice and perseverance. Let students know that they will complete similar tasks in later lessons, giving them the chance to build on this new skill.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.8, 6.II.A.1, and 6.II.A.2.

Assessment Guidance

- Refer students back to the Author’s Methods anchor chart to ensure that they are identifying a method listed there as a means of developing a key individual.

- Review students’ QuickWrite: Connect Text to Self, Chapter 1 to determine any common issues to use as teaching points.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will read chapter 2 of the anchor text. They will continue to practice identifying a central idea. This lesson allows for gradual release by providing extra scaffolding before students are given more independence to practice finding the central idea in the following lesson.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.6.4b (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 3** or the optional **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 3** ▲. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 3 (example for teacher reference)** for possible responses. Students will also need their **affix lists**. Add the word *inspecte* d to the **academic word wall**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- During Opening A, invite students who need heavier support to use the Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 3 ▲. This resource features a partially completed affix grid, reducing the amount of work students are expected to complete.

Work Time

A. Read *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, Chapter 1 Excerpt – RI.6.3 (25 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can find the gist of chapter 1 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*.”

“I can analyze how William is introduced and developed in *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*.”

- Invite students to retrieve their **text** and turn to page 17. Read aloud pages 17–35 of chapter 1 as students read along silently. Note that while students may read in small groups or individually in future lessons, students will benefit from this initial introduction to the text as a whole class.

- Read aloud the selected excerpt, using the **Text Guide: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Think-Pair-Share:

“What happened?” (William describes the way that he plays with his friends that are similar to children all over the world. He also describes what is unique about his culture—the role of the *sing’ana* or witch doctor. William describes several encounters with magic that eventually make him skeptical of magic.)

“What habits of character did you practice as William described his experiences of being bullied and not chosen for soccer? Why?” (Student responses will vary, but may include empathy and compassion because William describes how his voice cracked, which helps us understand he was upset and afraid.)

“What is the gist? What is this excerpt mostly about?” (William explains the role magic plays in his culture and why he is skeptical of magic.)

- Invite a student to paraphrase the key points in more comprehensible language for those who need heavier support. ▲

- Model recording gist (key words, not full sentences) on a **sticky note**, and invite students to do the same, sticking them at the front of the chapter for quick reference. Students will also benefit from adding the chapter number and their initials on the sticky note for easier materials management. Refer to the **Gist anchor chart: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*** **(example for teacher reference)**.

- Use **Synopsis: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind, Chapter 1*** to review and note key details for this excerpt. This will help to complete students’ understanding of the events, especially if they are not able to complete the reading of the full excerpt.

- Invite students to share any new words, adding any unfamiliar words to their **vocabulary logs**. Add any new words to the academic word wall and **domain-specific word wall**, and invite students to add translations in native languages. ▲

- Ask:

“Now that we’ve finished chapter 1, what more do you know about William?” (Answers will vary.)

- Direct students to retrieve and add to the **Analyze Key Individual: William note-catcher** for chapter 1.

- Ask:

“What methods do the writers use to introduce or develop William as a key individual in the first half of chapter 1?”

“What can the reader infer about William and his character in the first half of chapter 1?”

- Using a total participation technique, such as **equity sticks**, call on students to share their initial thoughts and to review and correct any misunderstandings. Refer to the **Analyze Key Individual: William Note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- If productive, cue students to expand upon their answers:

“Can you say more about that? Can you give an example?”

- Based on student input, update the **Author’s Methods anchor chart**. Refer to the **Author’s Methods anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time A, after completing chapter 1, invite students to participate in a Mini Language Dive in small groups to explore ways that the text illustrates connections among kids across the world (RI.6.1, RI.6.2). Students can refer to these ideas when completing the QuickWrite of Closing and Assessment A. This Mini Language Dive also gives students the opportunity to review conventions of standard English by reviewing (L.6.2).

Work Time

B. Determine Central Idea: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, Chapter 1 – RI.6.2 (10 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can determine a central idea in the text and how it is conveyed through particular details.”

- Remind students that a central idea is the main point the author wants the reader to understand and to take away from reading the text. A central idea can be determined by looking for patterns and repetition in the key details of a text.

- Invite students to skim and scan chapter 1 in its entirety and record on a sticky note the words, phrases, or images that recur throughout the text and might indicate the central idea. After three minutes, refocus students. On the board or chart paper, create the Central Idea Visual by drawing a smaller square inside of a larger square. Label the outer square “What?”, and label the inner square “So What?”. Point out that this box is in the center of the larger box because it contains the central idea. Refer to the **Central Idea Visual (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Use equity sticks to select students to share out a key detail he/she highlighted. Record responses in the “What?” section (outer square). When enough responses have been recorded to notice a pattern or repeated idea, ask:

“What patterns do you notice in these responses? What words, phrases, images, or ideas get repeated in chapter 1?” (William talks a lot about the setting of his village and the people who live there, about experiences with magic though his are largely negative. He talks about the difference he sees between science and magic. He is concerned about how some people around him rely on magic to explain things.)

- Distill student ideas into a single central idea: William is skeptical of magic and the way it shapes the thinking of his friends and family.

- Write the central idea in the “So What?” section (inner square). Remind students that a central idea answers the question “So what?” because it states something important the author wants the reader to understand and to take away from reading the text.

- Focus students on the chapter title. Point out that a chapter title can often be a clue to a chapter’s central idea.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- After Work Time B, after students have contributed to the “What?” and “So What?” sections on the board, invite students to create their own “mental maps” that visually depict the relationship between words and the central idea in the text. These mental maps should be shared with ELLs who need heavier support. Students can refer to these mental maps in the future when analyzing the central idea(s) of other chapters.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time B, students may struggle to locate recurring words and phrases in the text that contribute to the central idea. Provide students with a list of specific keywords or phrases that they can scan the text to look for and highlight. Looking for keywords will reduce the cognitive load for students; also, the ability to quickly and effectively scan text is an important component of fluency.

Closing and Assessment

A. QuickWrite: Connect Text to Self – W.6.10 (5 minutes)

- Distribute **QuickWrite: Connect Text to Self, Chapter 1**. Remind students that the goal of a QuickWrite is to get their ideas on the page without pausing to edit for conventions. Encourage students to write continuously for the allotted time. Refer to **QuickWrite: Connect Text to Self, Chapter 1 (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Direct students to the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart** and the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“Which habit of character are you going to focus on during this activity?” (Responses will vary, but may include the following: Perseverance to keep going even when I run out of ideas to write. Initiative to stay focused and get my work done.)

- Allow 3 minutes for students to respond to the given prompt. If necessary, remind students to be respectful as they write about William’s experience and think about how his life in Wimbe might connect to their own lives.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

- Collect the handout. Scan student responses and make a note of students who might need support. Check in with them moving forward.

For Lighter Support

- If students participated in the Mini Language Dive after Work Time A, challenge them to generate a second sentence using the frame from the Practice section of the Mini Language Dive and use this new sentence in their QuickWrites. Ask students to rewrite, in large lettering, sentences that correctly and effectively use this phrase. Display these sentences for all students to refer to during future writing assignments.

For Heavier Support

- If students participated in the Mini Language Dive after Work Time A, invite them to use in their QuickWrites the sentence with *Even thoug* h that they constructed during the Practice section of the Mini Language Dive. Verify student attempts and offer support as needed.

Homework

A. Analyze Author Methods and Central Idea

- Students complete **Homework: Analyze Author Methods and Central Idea: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, **Chapter 1**.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread chapter 2 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* in preparation for studying the chapter in the next lesson.
