- William Kamkwamba lives in the village of Masitala, which is on the outskirts of Wimbe in the country of Malawi. Malawi is located in southeastern Africa.

- William has six sisters, a mother and a father. His extended family (aunts, uncles, and cousins) also live in the village.

- William’s family is a farming family. The family grows maize (white corn).

- William and his community believe that magic rules the world. A *sing’anga*, or witch doctor, can be consulted for cures or curses.

- William accepts gumballs from a group of boys. The gumballs belong to a local trader. The trader speaks with the *sing’anga* and puts a curse on whoever stole the gumballs.

- William is terrified of the magic that will be unleashed upon him by the *sing’anga*, so William confesses to his father that he ate the gumballs.

- Tales of the magical forces of the Gule Wamkulu frighten William.

- William’s father is a devout Presbyterian and tells William to “respect the wizards . . . but with God on your side, they have no power against you.”

- William introduces his cousin Geoffrey and friend Gilbert, the chief’s son.

- During planting and harvesting time, William’s father hires a man named Mister Phiri to work the land with them. Mr. Phiri’s secret to his strength is magic called *mangolomera*.

- William is very small and gets picked on, so he begins to become more interested in *mangolomera*. Shabani, who brags about being a real *sing’anga*, offers to provide William with *mangolomera*. William accepts.

- William picks a fight with a boy much larger than him in order to test his new strength. William is beaten badly in the fight. He has a conversation with Shabani. William recognizes that he has been cheated.

- William’s perception of magic changes.
