W.6.10

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions**: Choose ONE of the following sentence frames to complete. Try to write continuously for two minutes.

1.  Connect something we learn about William and his life in chapter 1 to something that it reminds you of in your own life:

When William talked about \_\_\_\_\_, it reminded me of \_\_\_\_\_ because \_\_\_\_\_.

Answers will vary. Look for students to make relevant text to self connections using specific evidence from *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, chapter 1. Sample student response: When William talked about his friendship with Geoffrey and Gilbert, it reminded me of my friendship with Mia and Britta because just like them, we are always together, inventing games and creating our own fun. Everything is much more fun with my friends, and it seems like that’s the same for William even though in some ways his life seems very different than mine.

2.  Connect something we learn about William in chapter 1 to one of the habits of character:

When William \_\_\_\_\_, I saw evidence of \_\_\_\_\_ (habit of character). I could practice this habit of character by \_\_\_\_\_.

Answers will vary. Look for students to make relevant connections to a habit of character. Sample student response: When William builds his own toys from the materials he can find around his village, I saw evidence of initiative. I could practice this habit of character by thinking up creative solutions to have more fun with my friends.
