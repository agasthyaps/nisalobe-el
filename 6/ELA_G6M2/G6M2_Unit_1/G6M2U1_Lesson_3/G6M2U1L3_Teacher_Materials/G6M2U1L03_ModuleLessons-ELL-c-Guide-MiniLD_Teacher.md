5-Minute Mini Language Dive

RI.6.3, L.6.3

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

**Even though we lived in a small village in Africa,** we did many of the same things kids do all over the world; we just used different materials. (from page 20 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* by William Kamkwamba and Bryan Mealer)

**Lesson 3 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after students read the chapter 1 excerpt of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* in Work Time A.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the Daily Learning Target (I can analyze how William is introduced in *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*) and RI.6.3 and L.6.3 by describing William’s activities in his community and by including a complex structure (dependent clause + independent clause) that follows standard conventions of English writing.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses a conjunction (**even though**) to introduce an element of surprise and precedes an independent clause.

- Transfer: **Even though** + independent clause, independent clause = to complete a QuickWrite during Closing and Assessment A based on the prompt **William’s hometown reminds me  
  of \_\_\_\_ because \_\_\_\_.**

**  
Deconstruct**

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **<u>Even though we lived in a small village in Africa,</u> we did many of the same things kids do all over the world; we just used different materials.**

- Say:

“What does this sentence mean to you?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **Even though we lived in a small village in Africa,**

- Say:

“What do you notice about this chunk?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“Can this chunk stand on its own as a complete sentence? How do you know?” (No; it uses the phrase even though, which introduces a dependent clause.)

- Draw students’ attention to the phrase **even though**. Display the following definition: Writers and speakers often use the phrase **even though** to introduce ideas that might be unusual or surprising.

- Say:

“What detail does even though introduce in this chunk?” (The detail that William and his friends lived in a small village in Africa.)

“Can you figure out why William uses the phrase even though?” (To introduce a surprising detail/idea in the next chunk.)

- Draw student attention to the clause **we did many of the same things kids do all over the world.** Point out that the use of **even though** indicates that the authors think this idea might be surprising to the reader.

- Say:

“Why might it be surprising that William and his friends do many of the same things kids do all over the world?” (Responses may vary, but may include the following: because they have fewer resources; because they have less money; because they have less access to the toys and activities that other people might.)

“Do you find it surprising that a kid living in a small village does many of the same things that other kids around the world do? Why or why not?” (Responses will vary.)

**  
Reconstruct**

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **<u>Even though we lived in a small village in Africa,</u> we did many of the same things kids do all over the world; we just used different materials.**

- Say:

“Why do writers and speakers use the phrase even though?” (To introduce surprising details; to show contrast or difference.)

“What other words or phrases could we use instead of even though? (Although; though; but; however.)

- If time allows, invite students to reconstruct the sentence using these alternatives. Note that some of these synonyms require restructuring the sentence.

“How can we use even though in our speaking or writing?” (Responses will vary.)

- Say:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the Daily Learning Target I can analyze how William is introduced in The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind?” (Responses will vary.)

**Practice**

- Display the sentence frames:

> **Even though I live in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and not Malawi, I \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

place independent clause

> (**Even though** + independent clause, independent clause)

- Say:

“Use this frame to talk about your relationship to William. Use your own words and work with your partners.”

- Responses will vary. Sample response:

> **Even though I live in <u>Chicago</u> and not Malawi, I <u>can imagine what William’s hometown looks like</u>.**
