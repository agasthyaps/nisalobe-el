<td><p>The TED Talk uses dialogue and images to present events. As an interview, Chris Anderson is leading the discussion; in the book, William is the main narrator.</p>
<p><em>The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind</em> provides a detailed step-by-step process of William’s construction of the windmill. It also gives a lot more context before and after the building of the windmill.</p></td>
<td><p>The information presented in the TED Talk reinforces the information written in <em>The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind</em>. It focuses on William’s main accomplishment—the windmill—to reinforce this great achievement.</p>
<p>The TED Talk allows readers to see and hear from William in his own voice. This helps readers to remember that this is a nonfiction story.</p></td>

**Reflect:** Based on our reading, what can we infer about William’s strengths and challenges? Cite evidence from the texts to support your answer.

> Sample student response: William Kamkwamba’s strength is his resourcefulness. *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* and “William Kamkwamba’s Electric Wind” both show how William creates tools out of everyday materials. William’s main project, the windmill, was built from these types of materials. William’s resourcefulness led him to success. Though William is clever and curious, he does not do well in school. *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* describes how William did not get accepted into a top secondary school. He scored low on his placement exams. Missing that opportunity kept William from getting into a school with a good science program.
