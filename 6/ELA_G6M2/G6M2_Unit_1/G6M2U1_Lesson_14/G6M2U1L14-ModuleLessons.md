Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.6.5 – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they analyze how a section is functioning within the larger structure of a text and contributes to the development of a central idea.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time A: After students read an excerpt from chapter 9 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, they continue to complete the Design Solution: William note-catcher, using textual evidence to support their analysis of the chapter’s ideas.

- W.6.8 – Work Time A: Students continue to gather information from multiple sources on their Design Solution: William note-catchers.

- SL.6.2 – Work Time A: Students interpret information from diverse media and formats on their Design Solution: William note-catchers.

- RI.6.7 – Work Time A: Students continue to integrate information about William from multiple sources on their Design Solution: William note-catchers.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time B: Students draw upon textual evidence in preparation for a text-based discussion that will take place in Lesson 15.

- SL.6.1a – Work Time B: Students prepare for a collaborative text-based discussion by reviewing and gathering evidence to support their positions.

- In this lesson, the character focus is on working to become an ethical person. The characteristics that students practice are respect, empathy, and compassion as they prepare for a collaborative discussion in which they discuss what constitutes a critical problem.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- During Work Time B, introduce select students to Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, using an infographic if possible. Guide them to use the language of this tool to refine their thinking about what designates a problem as critical.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students read the first half of chapter 9 in the anchor text and will finish reading the rest of the chapter during this lesson.

- Students also saw a model Fishbowl discussion and were given the prompt for their own Fishbowl discussion, which will take place in the next lesson. Students will gather evidence during this lesson to answer that prompt and prepare for the upcoming discussion.

Support All Students

- Chapter 9, which is read in two parts over Lessons 13 and 14, is critical for students to understand, as it introduces them to key elements of the design process and the way it can be used to develop innovative solutions. Continue to support ELLs as much as possible as they read this chapter, pausing frequently for comprehension checks, using strategic groupings to form reading triads, providing short summaries or glossed vocabulary, or providing additional time, if it is available. ▲

- Students may need additional support preparing for the text-based discussion. Consider assigning those who will find this challenging to work with the instructor.

- During Work Time B, students will grapple with the discussion prompt: “What makes (a problem) <u>critical</u>?” Note that due to their age and varying levels of maturity, middle school students may have skewed ideas about what problems constitute as “critical.” Use probing questions in a sensitive and open-minded manner to help students express what is critical in their lives.

- To support ELLs, this lesson continues to prepare students for the text-based discussion of the following lesson. Students are given more time to generate ideas and add to their note-catchers.

- ELLs may find it challenging to consolidate the ideas written on their note-catchers and share them orally during the text-based discussion of Lesson 15. Encourage students to read their notes silently to themselves multiple times, and then practice saying their ideas aloud without looking at their note-catchers. Help them notice the small variations in what they say aloud versus what they have written on their note-catchers. Remind students that the goal of the discussion is to present informed ideas in a natural way; they should not memorize their notes, nor should they read from them.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.3, 6.I.B.5, and 6.I.B.6.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Design Solution: William note-catchers to ensure that they are fully prepared for the discussion. Remind students that the problems that were critical for William are not the only critical problems that exist nor are they problems that all of the students will face. Their discussion should be rooted in the text, but students can also consider how context changes the urgency of a problem.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will participate in the text-based discussion which will conclude Unit 1. In Unit 2, students will explore TED Talks in which other innovators like William use the design thinking process to address critical problems.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.6.5 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 14**. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 14 (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, Chapter 9 Excerpt – RI.6.7 (20 minutes)

- Explain that chapter 9 is an especially long chapter; students read the first half in the previous lesson. Today students will read from the middle of the chapter on page 150 starting at “In my mind . . . ” and ending at the conclusion of the chapter on page 162.

- Repeated routine: Read the excerpt of chapter 9 of the **text**, using **Text Guide: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students who are ready to read independently or in small groups should be released to this independence. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Refer to the following resources as appropriate to support this section of the lesson: **Gist anchor chart: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*** **(example for teacher reference)**, **Synopsis: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, **Chapter 9**, **vocabulary logs**, and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Gist: William, Gilbert, and Geoffrey use their research and salvaged items to start building a prototype of a windmill.

- Turn and Talk:

“Which habits of character is William practicing as he works on the windmill in this chapter?” (Student responses will vary, but may include perseverance as he persistently works on the project, even when his mother thinks he’s just playing with toys, and initiative as he tries to build the windmill to solve the problem.)

- Direct students to retrieve their **Design Solution: William note-catcher**. Remind them that this note-catcher is being used to keep track of how William uses the design thinking process to work from his problem to his solution. Remind them also that in Unit 2, they’ll use this same organizer when they conduct independent research on another critical problem whose innovative solution was created through the design thinking process.

- Direct students to Part I, section C. Design Solution. Remind them that the rows where they’ll gather evidence for each of the design thinking stages is color-coded to the design thinking graphic. Ask students to point out where this section of the note-catcher falls on the design thinking graphic.

- Ask:

“Where is William in this process, as of chapter 9? Is he at the beginning, middle, or end of the process?” (William is in the Plan phase. He has identified the problem, thought of the solution, and is now working on gathering the information and materials he needs to actually build the windmill.)

- Read the prompts in the rows of section B aloud and clarify as needed. Work as a class, using whatever level of modeling or thinking-aloud best support students, or have students work in pairs to begin work on this section. Refer to the **Design Solution: William note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

B. Prepare for a Text-Based Discussion – SL.6.1a (15 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can prepare for a text-based discussion.”

- Display, read, and rephrase the discussion prompt aloud for the group:

“What critical problems does William face? What makes them <u>critical</u>?”

- Ask students to retrieve their text, gist statements, vocabulary logs, and Design Solution: William note-catchers. Tell students they will be adding on to sections A (General Overview) and B (Critical Problem) of the Design Solution: William note-catcher based on the new reading. Invite students to star these sections for easy reference during the discussion in the next lesson.

- Tell students they have the option of working alone to complete their note-catchers or with a partner. Emphasize that as part of this prompt asks for a personal response (What makes a problem critical?), students may wish to do this alone, but invite those who want to work with someone to move to a certain area of the room to pair up with someone else who wants to work with a partner. Invite students to orally “complete” the note-catcher in home language groupings. They can then focus on writing notes in their home language or English, or making sketches as placeholders, and finally discussing in English. ▲

- Direct students’ attention to the Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart. Focus students on empathy, respect, and compassion, and remind them to attend to these habits of character as they work in their groups.

- Invite students to begin working. Circulate to support students in completing their note-catcher. Look for students to note that the most critical problems William faces are a lack of food, electricity, education, and resources. Students should also note that critical problems are those that threaten a person’s physical, mental, or emotional safety. Refer to Design Solution: William note-catcher (example for teacher reference). Note that due to their age and varying levels of maturity, middle school students may have varied ideas about what problems constitute as “critical.” Use probing questions in a sensitive and open-minded manner to help students express what is critical in their lives.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Closing and Assessment

A. Peer Share – SL.6.1a (5 minutes)

- Using the Dance Card protocol, choose a color or category from the **dance cards** to assign partners. Ensure that this is a different partner than the one they worked with during Work Time B. Direct students to take turns sharing their responses on the Design Solution: William note-catcher. Students should revise and refine their initial ideas and add any new responses provided by their dance card partner.

- Refocus groups after 4 minutes.

- Repeated routines: Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Apply Design Thinking

- Students continue working on Part I, sections A, B, and C of the Design Solution: William note-catcher. Invite students to also add relevant information from the TED Talk and/or “William Kamkwamba’s Electric Wind.”

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread chapter 10 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* in preparation for studying the chapter in the next lesson.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- Encourage students who need heavier support to rewatch the Fishbowl Model Video of the previous lesson on their own as homework. Students should note the volume, pacing, and body language (e.g., eye contact) of the students involved in the discussion; then, on their own, they can practice iterating their own ideas aloud (ideally with a friend or parent), making sure to speak clearly and with appropriate volume.
