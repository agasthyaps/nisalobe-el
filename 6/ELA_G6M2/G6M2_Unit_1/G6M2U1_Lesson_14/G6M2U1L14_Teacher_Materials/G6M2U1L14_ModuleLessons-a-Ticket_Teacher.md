(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions**: As you enter class, read the learning targets. Then, answer the question below.

Reread an excerpt of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind,* chapter 9, starting on page 149 with “All I needed was a windmill . . .” and ending on page 150 with “ . . . it was freedom.”

How does this excerpt fit into the overall structure of the text and help to develop a central idea of the text?

Answers will vary, but may include the following: Even though the book follows the events of William’s life in a chronological order, the text’s overall structure can be seen as problem-solution. This section comes almost at the exact middle of the book. It marks an important moment for William, one that clearly shows the problem and William’s solution. He now realizes what the solution is to their problems, and how much this solution would change their lives. Although he still needs to figure out how to build the windmill, he has found his solution, and this excerpt shows the reader his vision for success.
