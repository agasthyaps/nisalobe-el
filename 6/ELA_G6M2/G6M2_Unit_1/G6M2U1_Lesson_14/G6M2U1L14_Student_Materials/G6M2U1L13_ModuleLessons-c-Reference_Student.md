Synopsis: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, Chapter 9

**Name:** **Date:**

- Not being able to afford school, William has little to do around the farm. He seeks out the library at Wimbe Primary.

- William spends hours in the library and checks out the same textbooks that his peers are using in school. William intends to get caught up in his studies.

- He discovers the textbook *Explaining Physics* and learns about magnets, alternating current, and direct current.

- Next he discovers the textbook *Using Energy,* which introduces William to a potential solution for creating electricity—a windmill.

- William locates materials around Masitala to build a small model of the windmill. He improvises when he does not have the proper tools.

- William needs an item for the windmill from Geoffrey. Geoffrey joins William and Gilbert in building the windmill.

- The small windmill is a success, so William plans for a bigger windmill.

- William searches the scrapyard of an old tobacco plantation, where he locates many of the materials he needs for the windmill.
