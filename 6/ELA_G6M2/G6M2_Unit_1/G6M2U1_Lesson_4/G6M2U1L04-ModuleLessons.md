Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.6.1 – Work Time A: Students use evidence from chapter 2 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* to support their ideas about how the writers develop William as a key individual.

- RI.6.3 – Work Time A: After students complete chapter 2, they add to their Analyze Key Individual: William note-catchers.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time B: Students use evidence from the text to support their understanding of chapter 2’s central idea.

- RI.6.2 – Work Time B: Students locate recurrent details in chapter 2 and use these details to generate a single central idea of the chapter.

- RI.6.1 – Closing and Assessment A: Students complete an exit ticket in which they use evidence from the text to answer selected response questions about chapter 2.

- RI.6.2 – Closing and Assessment A: Students practice answering selected-response questions about the central idea of chapter 2.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- The RI.2 standard for Grade 7 requires students to determine two or more central ideas in a text. Challenge students to go back to chapter 1 to identify a second central idea or more.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students finished reading chapter 1 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*. With guidance, they practiced a strategy to determine the central idea of a text. In this lesson, students read chapter 2 of the text and work with their peers to determine the central idea.

Support All Students

- Developing readers may find it challenging to read large quantities of text in class. Support strategic reading ability by teaching students to adapt their reading purposes and expectations as they read. One way to do this is by differentiating between chapters that must be understood in detail to comprehend the text and chapters that can be understood only for the gist without disrupting overall text comprehension. Chapter 2, which introduces William’s dog Khamba, does not include any critical plot or character developments; thus, it can be read less closely. By contrast, chapter 3, which will be read during Lesson 5, contains concepts closely related to the module’s guiding questions and should be read carefully. ▲

- Be aware that descriptions of hunting are present in the text (e.g., pages 40–43). These descriptions, though generally not graphic, may be upsetting to some students who are particularly sensitive to animal-related issues. If students seem upset by these descriptions, allow them to skip hunting-related sections of the text, as these are not crucial for understanding the central idea of the text.

- To support ELLs, this lesson repeats, with slight modifications, a task from the previous lesson in which students scan sections of the text and use recurring details as clues to the text’s central idea(s). In this lesson, some supports are released, while other new supports are put in place: students work more independently, in small groups instead of with the whole class, but are assigned shorter selections of the text to scan. Repeating familiar activities with small modifications instills confidence, clarifies expectations of student work, and poses reasonable challenges to support students’ learning.

- During Work Time B, students revisit the Work To Become Effective Learners anchor chart and focus on the “initiative” trait. ELLs may find it challenging to show initiative, especially if they are struggling to understand the content or purpose of an assignment. Remind students that initiative can take many forms and it does not always require knowing the answer. Students can show initiative by, for example, being the first to ask an important question that clarifies the task for everyone.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.2, 6.I.A.3, 6.I.B.6, and 6.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- In addition to verbally describing the directions for creating the Central Idea Visual in Work Time B, provide a chart depicting each step. Additionally, select a pair of students or model with a student how to effectively participate. This will clarify expectations for all students, especially ELLs, for whom a verbal description alone may be insufficient. ▲

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will read chapter 3 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* and review the criteria for an effective summary by organizing sentence strips into a summary of the chapter. Students will also set up their dance cards for the Dance Card protocol which will be used several times throughout this module.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Read chapter 2 in advance to identify plot points and vocabulary that may require clarification or sensitivity.

- Plan strategic groupings for work on central idea during Work Time B. Divide students into four groups. Each group will read a section of chapter 2. Note that the sections vary in length. Plan to assign more proficient readers to the longer sections. ▲

- Review the student tasks and example answers to get familiar with what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Prepare copies of handouts for students, including entrance and exit ticket (see Materials list).

- Gather chart paper, markers, and highlighters for students to create their central idea visual in Work Time B.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time B: Use a collaborative and interactive tool such as http://eled.org/0124 to create a digital version of the central idea visual.

- Closing and Assessment A: Create the exit ticket as a Google Form to more easily compile and review responses.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.6.4a (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 4**. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 4 (example for teacher reference)** for possible responses.

- Using a preferred classroom routine, collect or review the answers to **Homework: Analyze Author Methods and Central Idea: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, **Chapter 1**. Refer to the **Homework: Analyze Author Methods and Central Idea: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, **Chapter 1 (example for teacher reference)**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, Chapter 2 – RI.6.3 (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Read chapter 2 of the **text**, using **Text Guide: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*** (for teacher reference) for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students who are ready to read independently or in small groups should be released to this independence. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Refer to the following resources as appropriate to support this section of the lesson: **Gist anchor chart: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*** **(example for teacher reference)**, **vocabulary logs**, **Synopsis: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind,*** **Chapter 2** and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Gist: William’s uncle John dies, leaving Geoffrey without a father but with a farm to maintain. William’s uncle Socrates gives William a dog, Khamba, and William and the dog become close friends.

- Turn and Talk:

“Which habits of character did you practice as you read about the death of William’s uncle John? Why?” (Student responses will vary, but may include empathy and compassion for both William, who lost his uncle, William’s father who lost his brother, and Geoffrey who lost his father, especially when it describes how Geoffrey walked out of his house crying and looking confused.)

- Direct students to the **Author’s Methods anchor chart**. Provide or ask a student to read the definition of *examples* from the anchor chart. Refer to the **Author’s Methods anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**. Ask a student to rephrase the definition in their own words (specific instances of something being discussed so we understand a concept or idea better).

- Direct students to reread the paragraph that starts at the bottom of page 40 starting with “I also carried two knives that I crafted myself.”

- Turn and Talk:

“How does this excerpt match the definition of examples?” (It tells about two specific samples of things William has made himself, his two knives.)

“What do we learn about William from these examples?” (These examples help readers understand that William has both the ideas and the ability to imagine and create the things he needs. William is resourceful and clever and is able to create what he needs with limited resources.)

“What’s another time the authors use examples to help develop our understanding of William and the ideas being conveyed in the text?” (In chapter 1, William gives us lots of examples of how people think about magic, which helps to convey that William’s ideas are different from many of the people in his community and he relies on science when others rely on magic.)

- Repeated routine: Using strategic groupings, invite students to work with their peers to synthesize what they now know about William and complete the next row of their **Analyze Key Individual: William note-catcher**. Refer to the **Analyze Key Individual: William note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Use a total participation technique to review and correct any misunderstandings before moving on. Update the Author’s Methods anchor chart. Refer to the Author’s Methods anchor chart (example for teacher reference).

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

B. Determine Central Idea of a Chapter – RI.6.2 (20 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can determine a central idea of a text and how it is conveyed through particular details.”

- Remind students of the work completed in Lesson 3 on determining a central idea. Cold-call a student to give the definition of *central idea* in his/her own words (the main point\[s\] the author wants the reader to understand and to take away from reading the text).

- Ask:

“What strategies did you use to determine the central idea of the excerpt in the previous lesson?” (Looking for repeated words, phrases, and ideas. Using the title as a hint.)

- If productive, cue students to seek to understand one another’s comments:

“Who can tell us what your classmate said in your own words?”

- Strategically divide students into four groups. Assign each group a section of chapter 2 to skim as follows. Note that the sections vary in length. Assign more proficient readers to the longer sections. ▲

- Pages 36–37 from the beginning of the chapter to “ . . . on their way.”

- Pages 37–40 from “Not long after . . . ” to “ . . . talking to animals now!”

- Pages 40–43 from “Aside from upsetting . . . ” to “‘Let’s go eat.’”

- Page 43–44 from “Back at the house . . . ” to “‘ . . . that’s another story!’”

- Distribute **chart paper** and **markers** to each group. Explain that they will be creating a central idea visual as modeled in the previous lesson. Direct students to draw a smaller square inside of a larger square on their chart paper. Remind students to record the “What?” (details of the section) in the outer square and the “So What?” (importance of the details; what they reveal; why the author included them) in the inner square.

- Point students to the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**, and focus on the *responsibility* trait. Ask:

“How can you show responsibility during this next activity?” (By staying on task and focused during each of the steps reading, discussing, and recording.)

- Allow 5 minutes for students to skim their section, and discuss and record their responses on the chart paper. Assign one student from each group to share their “What?” and “So What?” responses.

- Turn and Talk:

“What patterns do you notice in these responses? What words, phrases, images, or ideas get repeated?” (They’re mainly about Khamba, William’s dog, and how William didn’t expect to like the dog. Khamba turns out to be a good companion because he is patient while William builds and invents.)

- Distill student ideas into a single central idea: William’s dog Khamba is an unexpected but beloved friend.

- Be explicit in pointing out that the first section of chapter 2 was about the death of Uncle John; while this is an important event, it is not the central idea of this chapter. Focus students on the chapter title—“Khamba.” Remind students that a chapter title can often be a clue to a section’s central idea.

- Direct students’ attention to the **Criteria for an Effective Summary anchor chart**. Remind students that a summary for an informative text is very similar to a summary for a narrative text, but with informative texts rather than identifying themes, they need to clearly state the central/main idea(s), and find evidence to support those central/main ideas. Draw a line under the previous criteria and use the Criteria for an Effective Summary anchor chart (for teacher reference) to add the criteria for informative text summary.

- Inform students that the work with central idea and key details will help to support their summary work in upcoming lessons.

- Distribute **highlighters** to each group and have groups rotate to a different group’s chart paper. Explain that students will highlight on the chart paper the key details that should be included in a summary of chapter 2. Alert students that they may highlight multiple details on some charts and fewer or none on others, and that is okay. Refer to the **Central Idea Visual: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, **Chapter 2 (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Allow 2 minutes for students to discuss and highlight. Invite one student from each group to share a detail they highlighted and why they chose it. Note that some groups may have multiple key details to share and others, like those working with the first part of the text, may have very few or none. Prompt students to share their thinking, especially if they decided that none of the details were key to a summary of the chapter.

- If time allows, as an extension, invite one student to provide a sample oral summary as a way to synthesize their understanding of this activity. Ask other students to listen carefully and suggest any needed additions or changes. Explain that determining the central idea and locating key details are essential for writing an effective summary, which students will practice in the next lesson.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time B, assign students who need lighter support to the chapter 2 sections that begin on page 37 or page 40; these passages are slightly longer, posing an additional challenge to more proficient readers.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time B, assign students who need heavier support to the chapter 2 sections that begin on page 36 or 43; these passages are slightly shorter, simplifying the scanning task for less proficient readers.

- Decrease the complexity of the task in Work Time B by providing multiple-choice options for the main idea of chapter 2. Have students identify the correct one and justify their choice by highlighting relevant evidence from their assigned section.

Closing and Assessment

A. Exit Ticket: Develop a Central Idea – RI.6.2 (5 minutes)

- Distribute the **Exit Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 4**. Direct students to reference the **Strategies to Answer Selected Response Questions anchor chart** as needed to answer the exit ticket. Refer to the **Exit Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 4 (example for teacher reference)**.

- Allow 3 minutes for students to respond.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Analyze Vocabulary and Author Methods

- Students complete **Homework: Analyze Vocabulary and Author Methods: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, **Chapter 2** to analyze vocabulary in context and author methods.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread chapter 3 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* in preparation for studying the chapter in the next lesson.
