Gradually, the witches and wizards didn’t seem as frightening or powerful, and I began to look at the world in a different way. I saw it as one explained by fact and reason, rather than mystery and hocus-pocus”

Answers will vary. Sample student response: The phrase “didn’t seem as frightening or powerful” from the excerpt helped me understand the meaning of skepticism because William’s thoughts about magic changed. What he once believed in and was frightened by no longer held the same power or fear. He became skeptical of magic because Shabani tricked him.
