Exit Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 4

RI.6.1, RI.6.2

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions**: Use your analysis of chapter 2 in *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* and its central idea to answer the following questions.

1.  Write the central idea we identified in class:

William’s dog Khamba is an unexpected but beloved friend.

2.  Which quotation from chapter 2 best develops this central idea?

3.  No one buys \[dogs\] as pets like they do in America, and they certainly don’t lavish them with rubber toys and fancy food (38).

4.  “Let’s hunt,” I said. Khamba’s ears perked at the command and he followed me into the trees (42).

5.  Khamba didn’t worry about bones at all, just swallowed his birds in one gulp and wagged his tail for more (43–44).

6.  <u>After that, I gave up trying to get rid of Khamba. In fact, I started to enjoy his company (39).</u>

7.  How does the quotation you chose develop the central idea? Explain your reasoning.

Answers will vary. Sample student response: The quote develops the central idea that William’s dog Khamba is an unexpected but beloved friend because it shows that William was not at first interested in having a dog as a pet but then realized he actually enjoyed Khamba as a companion.
