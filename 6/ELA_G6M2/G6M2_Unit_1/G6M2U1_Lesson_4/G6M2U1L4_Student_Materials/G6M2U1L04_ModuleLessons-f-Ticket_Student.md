**Directions:** Use your analysis of chapter 2 in *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* and its central idea to answer the following questions.

1.  Write the central idea we identified in class:

2.  Which quotation from chapter 2 best develops this central idea?

3.  No one buys \[dogs\] as pets like they do in America, and they certainly don’t lavish them with rubber toys and fancy food (38).

4.  “Let’s hunt,” I said. Khamba’s ears perked at the command and he followed me into the trees (42).

5.  Khamba didn’t worry about bones at all, just swallowed his birds in one gulp and wagged his tail for more (43–44).

6.  After that, I gave up trying to get rid of Khamba. In fact, I started to enjoy his company (39).

7.  How does the quotation you chose develop the central idea? Explain your reasoning.
