Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.6.7 – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they interpret a graphic that depicts the design thinking process.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time A: After students read an excerpt from chapter 9 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, they begin to complete their Design Solution: William note-catchers, using textual evidence to support their analysis of the chapter’s ideas.

- RI.6.7 – Work Time A: Students receive and begin to complete their Design Solution: William note-catchers. This note-catcher requires that students integrate information about William from multiple sources.

- W.6.8 – Work Time A: Students begin to gather information from multiple sources on their Design Solution: William note-catchers.

- SL.6.2 – Work Time A: Students interpret information from diverse media and formats on their Design Solution: William note-catchers.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time B: Students draw upon textual evidence in preparation for a text-based discussion that will take place in Lesson 15.

- SL.6.1a – Work Time B: Students prepare for a collaborative text-based discussion by reviewing the Fishbowl protocol and comparing it to the Socratic Seminar protocol from Module 1.

- RI.6.7 – Closing and Assessment A: During a QuickWrite, students integrate textual information from the text with visual information from a graphic about design thinking.

- In this lesson, the character focus is on working to become an ethical person. The characteristics that students practice are respect, empathy, and compassion as they prepare for a collaborative discussion in which they discuss the critical problems that William faces in *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* and what makes them critical.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Allow students who are particularly interested in the design thinking process to explore resources that teach engineering and design principles to middle school students, such as http://eled.org/0162 or http://eled.org/0173.

- Now that students have preread several chapters of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* as homework, consider an extension activity in which students consolidate a list of “Best Practices for Prereading.” This list could include a variety of strategies that students have found effective as they engage with new chapters and prepare to examine them in class (e.g., add unknown words to my vocabulary log; read the first and final paragraphs first; skim and scan for repeated words, important characters, or major plot events). Encourage students to adopt new strategies as they continue to preread on their own. ▲

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons students have closely read through chapter 8 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* and have identified William’s desire to address a critical problem with an innovative solution as one of the central ideas of the text. In this lesson, students learn more about the design thinking process and will pull evidence from their reading to prepare for a text-based discussion around the idea of critical problems.

Support All Students

- Chapter 9, which is read in two parts over Lessons 13 and 14, is critical for students to understand, as it introduces them to key elements of the design process and the way it can be used to develop innovative solutions. Support ELLs as much as possible as they read this chapter, pausing frequently for comprehension checks, using strategic grouping to form reading triads, providing short summaries or glossed vocabulary, or providing additional time, if it is available. ▲

- Students may need additional support working independently to prepare for the text-based discussion. Consider grouping those who will find this challenging and closely monitoring their work. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson prepares students for a text-based discussion based on the prompt “What makes a problem critical?” In this lesson, students have the option of collaborating with a partner to complete a note-catcher that organizes their ideas for the discussion and supports them with textual evidence. Think-Pair-Share protocols throughout the lesson offer students the chance to process their ideas before sharing them with others. Discussion norms from Module 1 are also reviewed as a group in order to ensure that all voices are heard and respected during the discussion.

- ELLs may find it challenging to allocate attentional resources to both comprehend the content of the Fishbowl Model Video: “Students Cite Evidence from Informational and Literary Text” in Work Time B and notice the structure of the protocol. Remind students that the purpose of watching the video is to locate differences between a Fishbowl protocol and the Socratic Seminar of Module 1 and not necessarily to understand each word the participants are saying.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.3, 6.I.B.5, and 6.I.B.6.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Design Solution note-catchers to ensure that they are on track for the discussion.

- Note that the actual discussion (in Lesson 15) is relatively short compared to the time spent preparing for it. Circulate and monitor discussions as students are filling in their note-catchers as much of their thinking and comprehension will be revealed during this stage in the process. The discussion that concludes this unit serves as practice for the discussion that takes place during the End of Unit 3 Assessment.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue their preparation for the text-based discussion before participating in the Fishbowl protocol in Lesson 15.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.6.10 (10 minutes)

- Distribute **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 13** and allow 5 minutes for students to complete the handout. Remind students that the image on the entrance ticket was included in the Infer the Topic resources at the beginning of the module.

- Display the **Design Thinking Process graphic**. Point to each stage of the design thinking process on the graphic, and provide an example by reading through the playground scenario. Check for understanding.

- Invite students to share their entrance ticket with a partner or ask one or two students to share their ideas.

- Point to the circular part of the Design Thinking Process graphic.

- Turn and Talk:

“Why might this part be circular instead of linear like the rest of the graphic?” (Because a designer, or innovator, might need to go through these steps multiple times before they are ready to move on to the final step—Share.)

- Explain that while the first unit focused on William’s story, his is just one of many examples of an innovator using the design thinking process. Beginning in this lesson, students will be looking for evidence of how the design thinking process was used by William to solve his problem.

- Incorporate reflection on and awareness of the following academic mindset: “This work has value to me.”

- Ask:

“How does learning about the design thinking process have value for you?” (Answers will vary. Responses may include the following: because it’s a formula I can use personally to address a problem and improve my life or the lives of others.)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, Chapter 9 Excerpt – RI.6.7 (20 minutes)

- Explain that chapter 9 is an especially long chapter. Today students will read only from the beginning of the chapter on page 137 to page 150 ending at “‘We start today.’” Explain that after reading, they will think about how William used the design thinking process.

- Repeated routine: Read the excerpt of chapter 9 of the **text**, using **Text Guide: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students who are ready to read independently or in small groups should be released to this independence. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Refer to the following resources as appropriate to support this section of the lesson: **Gist anchor chart: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*** **(example for teacher reference)**, **Synopsis: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, **Chapter 9**, **vocabulary logs**, and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Gist: William discovers textbooks on energy at the small local library. He decides to build a windmill to generate electricity for his family.

- Distribute and display the **Design Solution: William note-catcher**. Explain that this note-catcher will be used to keep track of how William uses the design thinking process to work from his problem to his solution. Explain that in Unit 2, they’ll use this same organizer when they conduct independent research on another critical problem whose innovative solution was created through the design thinking process.

- Direct students to Part I of the note-catcher. Explain there are four sections in Part I: section A is General Overview, section B is Critical Problem, section C is Design Solution, and section D is Reflection. Since they have now read through half of Chapter 9, explain that they can complete sections A and B. After they finish Chapter 9 in the next lesson, they will begin working on Section C. As they continue to finish the text in Unit 2, they will continue adding to Section C and complete Section D. They will also be incorporating evidence from the TED Talk and the “William Kamkwamba’s Electric Wind” article.

- Point out that the rows where they will gather evidence for each of the design thinking stages are color coded to the design thinking graphic. Inform students that Part II of the note-catcher will be completed during Unit 2.

- Read the first row question in Section A aloud, and invite students to offer responses. Model entering the information in the row as students do the same. Repeat the process for the other two rows in Section A. Refer to the **Design Solution: William note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Read the questions in Section B aloud and clarify as needed. Continue to work as a class, using whatever level of modeling or thinking-aloud best support students, or invite students to work in pairs to work on this section. Refer to the Design Solution: William note-catcher (example for teacher reference) as necessary.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

B. Prepare for a Text-Based Discussion – SL.6.1a (10 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify norms of a productive discussion.”

- Remind students that they generated a **Discussion Norms anchor chart** in Module 1 in preparation for participating in a Socratic Seminar. Explain that they will participate in another text-based discussion, this time using the Fishbowl protocol. To determine the difference in these two protocols, they will watch a video of students modeling the Fishbowl protocol.

- Turn and Talk:

“What was the procedure for a Socratic Seminar?” (Students conduct an academic discussion around an open-ended question. Students pull evidence from the text prior to engaging in the discussion. Students draw others into the conversation with probing questions or requests for clarification. When the conversation ends, the group debriefs the process.)

- Distribute the **Fishbowl Discussion checklist**. Cue the **Fishbowl Model Video**. Set the purpose for watching the video by asking students to notice how a Fishbowl is different from a Socratic Seminar and to look for the criteria on the Fishbowl Discussion checklist.

- Ask:

“What did you notice about how a fishbowl is distinct from a Socratic Seminar?” (A fishbowl has an inner and outer circle. The outer circle provides kind, specific, and helpful feedback to the inner circle as the discussion process. Groups then switch and repeat the process as a participant in a different circle.)

- Turn and Talk:

“What are some of the benefits of conducting a text-based discussion using a Fishbowl protocol?” (Responses will vary, but may include the following: It allows for all students to be engaged and participating, even if they are not part of the discussion. It provides an opportunity for peers to give feedback to each other. It challenges students in the outer circle to think of original ideas after hearing their peers in the inner group share their initial thoughts.)

“What criteria from the checklist did you notice in the video?” (Answers may vary, but all will be evident in the video.)

- As needed, cue students to elaborate upon their ideas:

“Can you say more about that?”

- Display and read aloud the prompt that students will be discussing in their own fishbowl discussion:

“What critical problems does William face? What makes them <u>critical</u>?”

- Turn and Talk:

“How do you define *critical*?” (Answers will vary, but may include the following: something that is very important; absolutely essential; of the highest priority)

- Invite one or two students to verify the student’s preliminary understanding of the word *critical* using a **print or online dictionary**. Have students read all of the potential definitions. Invite students to choose the definition that best matches the way *critical* is used in the prompt (very important; crucial; essential; grave).

- Explain that students will fill out this note-catcher in the following lesson but should begin thinking about the prompt in advance.

For Lighter Support

- For students who feel prepared to interpret the content of the Fishbowl Model Video in Work Time B, offer closed captioning (available on the video) for added support.

For Heavier Support

- Before students watch the Fishbowl Model Video in Work Time B, review the structure of the Socratic Seminar of Module 1 so that students are better prepared to compare the protocols. A visual component (e.g., through an impromptu skit that models the organization of a Socratic Seminar) may help refresh students’ memories.

Closing and Assessment

A. Peer Review – RI.6.7 (5 minutes)

- Direct students to form small groups to share Sections A and B on their Design Solution: William note-catchers, making additions or changes as needed to their own. Refer to Design Solution: William note-catcher (example for teacher reference).

- Refocus whole group after 4 minutes.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Apply Design Thinking

- Students continue working on Part I, sections A and B on the Design Solution: William note-catcher. Invite students to also add relevant information from the TED Talk and/or “William Kamkwamba’s Electric Wind.”

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
