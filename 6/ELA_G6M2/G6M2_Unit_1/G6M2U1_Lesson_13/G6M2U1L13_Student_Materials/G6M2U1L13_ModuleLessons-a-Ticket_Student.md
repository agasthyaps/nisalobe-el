Here are some questions that might drive each stage of the design process for someone interested in building the ultimate school playground:

- **Ask**: What would the ultimate school playground look like?

- **Imagine**: What features should the playground include (e.g., swings, slides, ziplines, trampolines)?

- **Plan**: Where would the playground be located? How much might it cost? What safety concerns should we consider?

- **Create**: Draw up blueprints and/or build a prototype!

- **Test**: Would the noise from the playground interrupt lessons in nearby classrooms? Is the playground accessible to everyone, including those in wheelchairs?

- **Improve**: Use the data you gained from your tests to improve on the design.

- **Share**: Build that playground and get outside to play!

- **Solution: Create the ultimate playground.**

What is another situation in your own life in which might you apply the design thinking process to solve a problem? What is at least one question would you ask to help you in each stage of the design process?
