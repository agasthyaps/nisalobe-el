Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Work Time A: Students complete the End of Unit 1 Assessment. They read chapter 8 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* and answer selected response questions to interpret the meaning of figurative language in the chapter, identify a central idea and how it is conveyed through details, and determine the text structure of the chapter and explain how the structure helps develop key ideas in the text. Students also write an objective summary of the chapter. (RI.6.1, RI.6.2, RI.6.3, RI.6.4, RI.6.5, RI.6.10, W.6.10, L.6.5a)

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners by demonstrating perseverance on the end of unit assessment.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- In the next lesson, students will be introduced to the design thinking process. Prime students for this new learning by allowing them to explore resources that teach engineering and design principles to middle school students, such as http://eled.org/0162 or http://eled.org/0173.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the second half of this unit, students read six chapters of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, identifying central ideas, determining the meaning of unfamiliar words, and summarizing what they read. This lesson continues those routines in an assessment.

- Thinking metacognitively about their work, students continue to identify areas of strength and improvement as they review feedback from their Mid-Unit 1 Assessments and fill in their next Track Progress form.

Support All Students

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment.

- Some students may need the text read aloud before they work on the questions. Invite students who require this to sit in a group away from the rest of the students, so as not to be distracting.

- For some students, this assessment may require more than the 30 minutes allotted. Consider providing time over multiple days if necessary.

- To support ELLs, this lesson invites students to complete assessment tasks similar to the classroom tasks in Lessons 7-11. Students read chapter 8 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* and then answer selected response and short constructed response questions about the text. Students also produce an objective summary of the chapter.

- ELLs may find it challenging to independently complete the end of unit assessment without scaffolding. Also, while the mid-unit assessment featured only selected-response questions, this end of unit assessment includes two short-response questions and a summary. Completing these questions requires more writing and more time than the mid-unit assessment. Point out that the end of unit assessment is similar to the activities they have successfully completed in class, and encourage students to do their best. Help students be mindful of the amount of time they spend on each task.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.7, 6.I.B.8, 6.I.C.10, 6.II.A.1, 6.II.A.2, and 6.II.C.6.

Assessment Guidance

- The End of Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Figurative Language, Central Idea, and Structure: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, Chapter 8 (student and teacher version) as well as summary writing rubric are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback on this assessment, use the answer key and sample student responses (see Assessment Overview and Resources) to help complete students’ Track Progress recording form.

- In this assessment, students are tracking progress toward anchor standards:

- R.1: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.

- R.4: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Interpret words and phrases as they are used in a text, including determining technical, connotative, and figurative meanings, and analyze how specific word choices shape meaning or tone.

- R.10: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Read and comprehend complex literary and informational texts independently and proficiently.

- L.4: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Determine or clarify the meaning of unknown and multiple-meaning words and phrases by using context clues, analyzing meaningful word parts, and consulting general and specialized reference materials, as appropriate.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students begin to prepare for a text-based discussion on the prompt “What makes a problem critical?” Students are introduced to this idea using a graphic about design thinking, the first step of which is to identify a critical problem to be solved. Students will distinguish the Fishbowl protocol, which they will use for this discussion and the End of Unit 3 Assessment, from the Socratic Seminar they completed in Module 1.

- Students will also read the first half of chapter 9 in the anchor text.

- Students’ End of Unit 1 Assessments will be returned in Unit 2 Lesson 4 with feedback.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Return Mid-Unit 1 Assessments (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 12**. Students will also need their **Mid-Unit 1 Assessment with feedback**.

- Using a preferred classroom routine, collect or review the answers to **Homework: Write Summary and Analyze Structure: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, **Chapters 2 and 6**. Refer to **Homework: Write Summary and Analyze Structure: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, **Chapters 2 and 6 (answers for teacher reference)**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. End of Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Figurative Language, Central Idea, and Structure: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, Chapter 8 (30 minutes)

- Distribute **End of Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Figurative Language, Central Idea, and Structure: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, **Chapter 8** and invite students to take out their copies of ***The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***.

- Tell students that for this assessment, they will independently read a new chapter in their anchor text. They will then identify the central idea of the chapter, key details that convey the central idea, and uses of figurative language. Finally, they will write an effective summary of the chapter.

- Invite students to follow along, reading silently in their heads, while the directions for each part of the assessment are read aloud. Make sure students understand the assessment directions; paraphrase some instructions, if needed. ▲ Answer students’ questions, but refrain from supplying answers to the assessment questions themselves.

- Direct students’ attention to the following anchor charts:

- **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart**

- **Strategies to Answer Selected Response Questions anchor chart**

- Remind students to refer to these anchor charts as they read the assessment text and answer the assessment questions.

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence. Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart** and review what perseverance looks and sounds like. Remind students that because they will be reading and answering questions independently for the assessment, they may need to practice perseverance.

- Invite students to begin the assessment.

- While they are taking the assessment, circulate to monitor and document their test-taking skills. Refer to **Synopsis: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, **Chapter 8 (for teacher reference)** as necessary, but do not share this handout with students to avoid compromising the integrity of the assessment.

- Give students specific, positive feedback on their completion of the End of Unit 1 Assessment. Refer to **End of Unit 1 Assessment: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, **Chapter 8 (answers for teacher reference)** to assess.

For Lighter Support

- Before the end of unit assessment in Work Time A, underline key vocabulary in the assessment directions and prompt and read aloud together as a class to ensure that students understand each task included in the assessment. Invite students who need lighter support to restate or clarify information for students who need heavier support.

For Heavier Support

- Display a “map” of the assessment to reference while explaining directions to the end of unit assessment. This will reduce ambiguity and give students a clearer picture of what they can expect so that they can better allocate their time and attentional resources. Provide students with colored pencils or highlighters so that they can mark up the “map” as needed. Example:

Read chapter 8. Then,

- Interpret figurative language.

- Select the best central idea of the text, and identify the evidence that supports it.

- Determine the structure of the text and explain how the structure helps develop the central idea.

- Use what William says to infer qualities of his character.

- Explain how a sentence contributes to the central idea of the chapter.

- Write a summary of the chapter.

- To help students manage their time during the end of unit assessment, consider displaying on the board or on a poster suggested times at which students should move onto the next question. Allocate the most time to the summary writing of question 6.

Closing and Assessment

A. Track Progress – RI.6.1 (10 minutes)

- Give students specific, positive feedback on their completion of the End of Unit 1 Assessment.

- Distribute **Track Progress folders**, **Track Progress: Read, Understand, and Explain New Text**, and **sticky notes**. Tell students the sticky notes are for them to find evidence of the following criteria:

- RI.6.1

- RI.6.4, L.6.4

- Guide students through completing the recording form.

- Distribute the **Writing Record**. Explain that this form can help students to keep track of all of the writing they complete this year. Fill in the first two rows to represent writing from Module 1 (Compare and Contrast Film and Text: *The Lightning Thief* and Rewritten Narrative: *The Lightning Thief*).

- Direct students to fill in the third row of the Writing Record about the summary they just wrote for the End of Unit 1 Assessment.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread chapter 9 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* in preparation for studying the chapter in the next lesson.
