Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 2

RI.6.3

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, read the learning targets. Then, answer the following prompt.

Skim through the prologue of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* again. Notice that although it is written in first person, the narrator’s name is not given. Why might the authors have chosen not to include the narrator’s name in the prologue?

Choose one of the answers (a–b) below. Then, explain why you chose that answer.

a\. <u>Because the authors want to make the readers interested in the story.</u>

b\. Because the authors think the narrator’s name is not important.

c\. Because the authors want to focus on other characters first.

Answers will vary. Sample student response: I chose answer A because the authors may have chosen not to include the narrator’s name in the prologue because they wanted the reader to focus on the action of that scene, specifically the question of whether the windmill would work or not. Not naming the narrator and starting with his background information when they introduce him allows the reader to jump right into a moment of great suspense.
