Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.6.3 – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they reflect on how the narrator of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, William, is introduced in the prologue.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time B: Students fill in a note-catcher, using evidence from the text to support their ideas about William’s character.

- RI.6.3 – Work Time B: Students use a note-catcher to analyze the methods used in chapter 1 to introduce and develop the readers’ understanding of William.

- RI.6.3 – Work Time C: Students use a note-catcher to analyze the methods used in the TED Talk to introduce and develop the readers’ understanding of William.

- In this lesson, the directions for routines that are repeated from previous lessons have been pared down and noted with “Repeated routine.” For the detailed outline of how to facilitate this part of the lesson, please refer back to previous lessons.

- The lesson begins with students reflecting on the module guiding questions. This is not mandatory—students share their reflections only if they want to do so. The main point students should understand by the end of this module is that the design process thinking is a scientific and systematic practice of inquiry that allows for creativity and innovation; students can harness that creativity and innovation to contribute to a better world by helping their school, community, and the environment.

- In this lesson, students engage in a protocol. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. Students engage in the following new protocol in this lesson (instructions for which appear at the first point of use in the lesson and in the Classroom Protocols document online; see the Tools page: http://eled.org/tools):

- Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face provides a method for sharing information and gaining multiple perspectives on a topic through partner interaction. It can be used for reviewing and sharing academic material, as a personal ice breaker, or as a means of engaging in critical thinking about a topic of debate.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become ethical people by showing respect and empathy as they share reflections on the guiding questions in Opening A.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Challenge students to create original sentences using their newly acquired vocabulary, while adding context clues to demonstrate their understanding of the definition. ▲

- While looking up definitions, draw students’ attention to the etymology of the vocabulary, noting especially those words that include a Greek root.

- *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* describes life in a small African village in Malawi. As students learn more about William’s community, it may be necessary to remind them that Africa is a vast, heterogeneous continent, and that not all of its countries and communities have the same struggles. Have students locate Malawi on a map of Africa. Then, pair students and assign each pair another African country or major city (e.g., Johannesburg, South Africa; Cairo, Egypt; Addis Ababa, Ethiopia). Ask students to find images of their given locale on Google images and then compare and contrast their images with those of other pairs. This activity may be especially affirming for ELLs or international students who come from Africa. ▲

- To extend learning, consider inviting students to analyze how other individuals referenced in chapter 1 are introduced.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students were introduced to the module topic by looking at resources in the Infer the Topic protocol and discussing the module guiding questions. Students will continue their discussion of the guiding questions during Opening A of this lesson.

- They will continue to build background knowledge on the module topic by watching William Kamkwamba’s first TED Talk. This will also reinforce their understanding of the prologue, which was read in the previous lesson. In this lesson, students continue in the anchor text, reading an excerpt from chapter 1 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*.

Support All Students

- Note that there are differentiated versions of the entrance ticket used in Opening A and the Analyze Key Individual: William note-catcher used in Work Time B in the ‘Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- In Work Time A, students read an excerpt from the first chapter of the text. Note that although *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* is generally sensitive to and affirming of cultural difference, there are occasional descriptions or allusions that may be upsetting to some students. In the first excerpt of chapter 1, characters in the text are said to feel sorry for the protagonist William because he has only sisters and no brothers. Comments that reference boys’ elevated status over girls are frequent throughout the text; this, when considered in conjunction with the fact that there are no main characters who are female, may feel exclusionary to female students. Be sensitive to this when teaching the novel and validate students’ concerns. Refer back to ideas about point of view that surfaced in Module 1; by assigning perspectives to the narrator or characters in the text, students can better distance themselves from potentially offensive attitudes presented in the text. Additionally, consider ways to amplify the voices of female characters (e.g., through a writing exercise in which scenes are rewritten through the perspective of William’s mother or sisters).

- Additionally in chapter 1, the local, non-Western medicine preferred by those in William’s community is conflated with the concept of “witch doctors.” Descriptions like these, present throughout the novel, may feel alienating to students from cultural environments where holistic or alternative medicinal approaches may be common. As a way to validate alternatives, consider facilitating a short discussion in which students brainstorm different kinds of medicinal or therapeutic options available when people get sick (e.g., a doctor’s visit, acupuncture, counseling, change in diet).

- *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* includes dialogue spoken in other languages, namely Chichewa, the language of William’s community. Recognizing and celebrating the inclusion of other languages in the text may be a good way to indirectly affirm the diverse linguistic identities of ELLs. ▲

- Extracting important ideas from information presented in various modes (e.g., a TED Talk, the first chapter of the anchor text) may pose a special challenge for ELLs, who might not have yet developed the language skills necessary to effectively shift attention across media. Encourage all students to simply enjoy the TED Talk without feeling compelled to understand every word or detail. Students’ cognitive energy should be saved for comprehending the first half of chapter 1, which introduces many important characters, including the protagonist, William. ▲

- Note that William Kamkwamba is featured in two TED Talks. Ensure that, for this lesson, students are focused on the first talk in which he is interviewed. At a strategic point in the module, view the second TED Talk with students. Compare and contrast how William is depicted in each; connect this discussion to the work around illustration and development of a key individual.

- To support ELLs, this lesson guides through a new note-catcher that students will use to collect textual information about William. Note-catchers help students organize and inform their ideas about the text and its characters. Additionally, students participate in a Think-Pair-Share protocol several times throughout the lesson, allowing ELLs time to individually process their ideas before discussing them with classmates.

- ELLs may find it challenging to participate in the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol of Work Time C, especially if they struggled to comprehend either the chapter 1 excerpt or the TED Talk. As an alternative, invite students to use this time to pose clarifying questions to their classmates about what they read or watched; as students do so, it may be useful for them to refer to the Discussion Norms anchor chart from Module 1. Note any recurring questions and address them in a future lesson. The mid-unit assessment in Lesson 6 will gauge students’ ability to analyze how a character is introduced and developed in a text, so it is critical that students get extra support if they need it as they practice this skill for the first time.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.2, 6.I.B.6, 6.II.A.1, and 6.II.A.2.

Assessment Guidance

- Refer students back to the Author’s Methods anchor chart to ensure that they are identifying a method listed there as a means of developing a key individual.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will read the second half of chapter 1 and continue analyzing how a key individual, William, is elaborated on in the text.

- Students also practice determining the central idea of a text using a “What?” and “So what?” visual strategy.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare the online video, TED Talk: “How I Built a Windmill.” Preload it to avoid buffering which may interrupt the flow of the lesson. The transcript is provided in case the video is unable to be viewed.

- Read chapter 1 in advance to identify plot points and vocabulary that may require clarification or sensitivity.

- Review the Classroom Protocols document to clarify the process for the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol prior to the beginning of this lesson.

- Review the student tasks and example answers to get familiar with what students will be required to do in the lesson.

- Prepare copies of handouts for students (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time A: Consider displaying the Synopsis: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, Chapter 1 before, during, or after reading the chapter to ensure students’ full comprehension of the chapter’s plot. ▲

- Work Time C: Preload the video, TED Talk: “How I Built a Windmill,” prior to starting the lesson to ensure that buffering or other technology glitches do not interrupt the flow of the lesson. Turn on the Closed Captioning feature during the TED Talk to enhance listening comprehension. ▲

- Work Time C: The transcript of the TED Talk featured in this lesson is provided in case the video is unavailable or cannot be viewed. Students will still be able to successfully fill in the Analyze Key Individual: William note-catcher if they are only able to read the transcript. Consider choosing two students to read the parts of Chris Anderson and William Kamkwamba in the interview if the video cannot be viewed.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.6.3 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 2** or the optional **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 2** ▲. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 2 (example for teacher reference)** for possible responses.

- Direct students’ attention to the posted learning targets and select a volunteer to read them aloud:

“I can analyze how William is introduced and developed in *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*.”

“I can analyze how William is introduced in the TED Talk.”

- Focus students on the phrase *TED Talk*. Explain that TED stands for *Technology, Entertainment, and Design*; the mission of TED is to spread knowledge about these topics and more through short, powerful talks by leaders in their fields. Add this phrase to the **domain-specific word wall**.

- Turn and Talk:

“What do you think you will be doing in this lesson, based on these learning targets?” (Reading the first chapter of our anchor text and watching a TED Talk. Analyzing how William is introduced in two different sources.)

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- During Opening A, invite students who need heavier support to use the Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 2 ▲. This resource allows students to select an answer from a list of options and defend it, rather than generating an answer independently.

Work Time

A. Read *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, Chapter 1 Excerpt (15 minutes)

- Invite students to retrieve their **text** and turn to page 4. Read aloud pages 4–17 of chapter 1 as students read along silently. Note that while students may read in small groups or individually in future lessons, students will benefit from this initial introduction to the text as a whole class.

- Read aloud the selected excerpt, using the **Text Guide: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed.

- Remind students they will finish chapter 1 in the next lesson. For this reason, they will hold off on determining gist.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What happened?” (William introduces himself and provides a bit of background about his country Malawi and his family.)

“What habits of character did you practice as you read about the hardships people faced in the area William grew up in? Why?” (Student responses will vary, but may include empathy and compassion because William describes how seeing a doctor is difficult for farmers, and how many farmers cannot afford an education.)

- Invite a student to paraphrase the key points in more comprehensible language for those who need heavier support. ▲

- Use **Synopsis: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, **Chapter 1** to review and note key details for this excerpt. This will help to complete students’ understanding of the events, especially if they are not able to complete the reading of the full excerpt.

- Invite students to share any new words, adding any unfamiliar words to their **vocabulary logs**. Add any new words to the **academic word wall** and domain-specific word wall, and invite students to add translations in native languages. ▲

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- Before reading the chapter 1 excerpt, invite students to collaborate and produce a list of “best practices” for finding the gist of a text based on their experiences in Module 1. Offer examples to get students started (e.g., highlight phrases that discuss important events; pay special attention to the way new characters are introduced).

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time A, invite students who need heavier support to use the Analyze Key Individual: William note-catcher ▲. This resource contains model answers to guide students’ understanding of expectations.

Work Time

B. Analyze Introduction of Key Individual: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* – RI.6.3 (10 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze how William is introduced and developed in *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*.”

- Before students analyze how the authors have introduced William, synthesize what students already know about him.

- Turn and Talk:

“What do we already know about William, the key individual of our anchor text?” (He lives in the village of Masitala, in the town of Wimbe, in Malawi, Africa; he lives with his six sisters and both parents; he speaks Chichewa; his family are farmers; he will build a windmill and generate electricity.)

- Display and introduce the **Author’s Methods anchor chart**. Briefly, review the methods listed and their definitions. See **Author’s Methods anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**. Explain that students will be learning more about each method of developing characters as they trace the way William is introduced and portrayed throughout this module.

- Explain that students are going to apply this beginning understanding about author’s methods to chapter 1 and the TED Talk.

- Distribute the **Analyze Key Individual: William note-catcher** or the optional **Analyze Key Individual: William note-catcher** ▲. Chorally read each of the headings of the graphic organizer. Explain that individuals, events, and ideas develop and interact over the course of a text. Careful readers take note of how a writer introduces and develops a key individual and how that individual evolves. Studying an individual’s experiences exposes the reader to new ideas, expands one’s knowledge, and prompts us to consider other worldviews that may challenge or strengthen one’s own convictions.

- Point out that there are two authors for this text, hence the reference to “writers” as plural. Note also that the word *character* as it is used in this context refers to one’s moral qualities, not character as in a person in a story. Remind students not to refer to William as a character as this text is narrative nonfiction; while it reads like a novel, it is, in fact, an informational text.

- Ask:

“What did we learn about William in the prologue?” (William is confident in himself and his machine. William demonstrates perseverance as he meticulously assembles the windmill even though others tease him and laugh at him.)

“How do you know this about William? What is one method the writers used to convey those qualities?” (They let us know what he was thinking, his inner thoughts; although we hear dialogue from other people, William doesn’t speak, but we get to know what he’s thinking.)

“How does this method help to introduce him and the events to come in the text?” (We are able meet him at the end of his process, the moment when he is successful, which tells us something about his character and makes us curious about how he got to this moment, so we are excited to read the book.)

- Think aloud to model filling in the first row of the graphic organizer in Part I. Note that the first row is focused on the prologue, which students read in Lesson 1. Refer to the **Analyze Key Individual: William note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** as necessary. Explain that the authors use multiple methods for introducing William in the prologue; students should be able to cite evidence for the method they have identified.

- Focus students on the second row—Chapter 1.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What is a method used by the writers to introduce or develop William as a key individual in the first half of chapter 1?” (Description.)

- Using a total participation technique, such as **equity sticks**, call on students to share their initial thoughts. Note that it is common during the exposition of a text for an author to use description to establish setting. Refer to the Analyze Key Individual: William note-catcher (example for teacher reference) as necessary.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“Why is this detailed description of the setting important to have in chapter 1? What can the reader infer about William and his character in the first half of chapter 1?” (We learn that there is little technology, which provides more context than is evident in the prologue. We learn what is important to William and the people in his village, and the description also helps us understand some of William’s thoughts, actions, and feelings that we were introduced to in the prologue.)

- Cue students to clarify their answers as needed:

“So do you mean \_\_\_\_?”

- Using a total participation technique, call on students to share their initial thoughts.

- Explain that they will continue to analyze how the authors’ methods develop our understanding of William and the ideas in the text during the rest of Unit 1.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

C. View TED Talk: “How I Built a Windmill” – RI.6.3 (10 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze how William is introduced in the TED Talk.”

- Explain that students will watch or read the transcript of William’s first TED Talk (he later gave a second) in which he is interviewed by Chris Anderson, the Curator of TED. Remind them that they will, again, be looking for evidence of how William is introduced and developed in this resource as they did with the text.

- Briefly review the two questions at the top of the columns of the Analyze Key Individual: William note-catcher. Direct students to listen for information that will help them respond to these prompts, though they do not need to write anything yet while they watch or read the transcript.

- Distribute **TED Talk Transcript: William Kamkwamba, “How I Built a Windmill”** and display the **TED Talk: William Kamkwamba: “How I Built a Windmill” video**. Play the talk in its entirety.

- Tell students that they will reflect on the interview using the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol. Guide students through the protocol as follows:

- Students find a partner and label themselves Partner A and Partner B.

- Students stand back to back with their partner, being respectful of space.

- Students wait for the question that they will be asked to share with their partner.

- Students think about what they want to share and how they might best express themselves.

- Say, “Face-to-face.” Students turn and face their partners. Partner A should answer the question first.

- Students listen carefully when their partner is speaking and make eye contact with him or her. Partner B should respond after Partner A is finished speaking.

- Say, “Back-to-back.” Students return to their initial position (back to back) and wait for the next question.

- Follow this process for each of the two prompts under Part I of the Analyze Key Individual: William note-catcher. Remind students to answer based only on the information from the TED Talk they just experienced.

- Refocus whole group, and call on individual students to share their or their partner’s response to one of the questions. Correct and clarify any misconceptions.

- Ensure that students notice that the TED Talk uses *dialogue* in an interview style to help the viewer understand what William was able to do, how he did it, and why his accomplishments are significant to be shared in this setting.

- Use a total participation technique to review and correct any misunderstandings before moving on and to update the Author’s Methods anchor chart. Refer to the Author’s Methods anchor chart (example for teacher reference).

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- A transcript for the TED Talk of Work Time C is available online. Distribute the transcript (in English) to students ahead of time. For an added listening challenge, white-out some of the transcript’s words or phrases and invite students to fill in the blanks based on what they hear as they watch the TED Talk. If possible, choose words and phrases that students have already studied and/or that are closely related to the module topic. These words may include *windmill, design, electricity*, and/or *energy*.

For Heavier Support

- Transcripts for the TED Talk of Work Time C are available in multiple languages. Create home language groups and inviting students to read the transcript first in their home language. Students can begin by discussing the material in their home languages before watching the video in English as a class.

Closing and Assessment

A. Reflect on the Module Guiding Questions (5 minutes)

- Remind students that they were introduced in the previous lesson to the guiding questions for the module. Invite students to reread the **Module Guiding Questions anchor chart**. Explain that not all students will be interested in design process thinking or William’s quest to build a windmill. Ensure students understand that it is okay to have different opinions.

- Remind students that for homework they were asked to reflect on what those guiding questions mean to them and how they feel about them. Students may want to retrieve any notes or sketches they made as part of their reflection.

- Focus students on the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**, specifically on respect and empathy and what this looks and sounds like.

- Invite any students who would like to do so to share their reflections with the whole group. This must be voluntary—if no one wants to share, that is okay.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“Where do we see answers to the module guiding questions starting to emerge in the text and video?” (Responses will vary. Possible responses: William is going to apply his learning to help his community by building a windmill to solve a critical problem—lack of electricity.)

Homework

A. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread the second half of chapter 1 (pages 17–35) of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.
