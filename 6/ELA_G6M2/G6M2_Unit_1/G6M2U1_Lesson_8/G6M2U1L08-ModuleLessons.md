Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.6.5 – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they match text-structure types to their definitions and then determine the text structure of four articles based on the articles’ titles.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time B: Students use textual evidence to support their answers to questions about chapter 4 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, which they read during the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment of Lesson 6.

- RI.6.2 – Work Time B: Students answer questions about the central idea(s) of chapter 4 of the text.

- RI.6.3 – Work Time B: Students answer questions about how a key idea is conveyed and elaborated on in chapter 4 of the text.

- RI.6.5 – Work Time B: Students answer questions about how individual sentences and paragraphs contribute to the overall structure of chapter 4 of the text.

- RI.6.5 – Closing and Assessment A: Students complete a QuickWrite in which they determine the text structure of chapter 5 of the text and identify specific words and phrases that signal the text structure.

- In this lesson, students read the first half of chapter 5; they complete chapter 5 in Lesson 9.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- This module has been designed to avoid assigning independent research reading for homework on the same evenings when students are prereading the next chapter in their anchor text. Proficient readers may be ready to begin their independent reading earlier in this unit. They could then be asked to prepare a Book Talk or other presentation of their reading for this lesson to promote excitement amongst their peers for the independent reading book selection.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students have had numerous opportunities to practice identifying a central idea and writing a summary of a nonfiction text. Students expand on these skills by analyzing how a particular sentence contributes to the structure of the text and helps to convey the central idea.

- The independent research reading assignment is critical for building background knowledge and domain-specific vocabulary on the module topic. At this point in the unit, students have gained enough context for the anchor text to begin developing a more complex understanding of the topic through the texts curated for the research reading list.

Support All Students

- Chapter 5, which is read across Lessons 8 and 9, describes the effects of the famine at the personal, family, community, and country levels. It may be challenging for a struggling reader to track these effects and understand them. Consider providing, or encourage students to develop, a “map” or timeline that more visually represents exactly who is affected by the famine.

- As the famine intensifies, scenes in the text darken and become more somber. Be sensitive to ways in which certain passages in the text may be distressing for students to read.

- Help students to make personal connections between themselves and the work. As they analyze how William as a person is showing more depth as they get to know him better through the text, point out that they, too, are complex individuals who are growing and changing all the time. Notice how the more they learn about each other, the more likely they are to feel connected to one another.

- Note that the Analyze Structure exercise of Work Time B may be challenging for some students, especially ELLs. Build in needed processing time by using Conversation Cues throughout the series of questioning and inviting students to think and process internally before sharing their responses. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson features scaffolded, direct instruction on text structure. Also, during this lesson, students also begin their independent research reading, which requires that they seek out and independently read texts related to the module’s topic, deepening content knowledge and strengthening reading skills.

- ELLs may find it challenging to select appropriate texts for independent research reading. Make sure students understand the purpose of this task. Emphasize the benefits of reading multiple texts on the same topic (e.g., repeated exposure to relevant vocabulary). Help ELLs who need heavier support while reading to locate simpler texts. Texts written slightly below a student’s reading level facilitate gains in reading speed and support reading fluency development: a critical skill for academic readers of all levels.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.2, 6.I.A.3, 6.I.B.6, and 6.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- The independent research reading assignment launched in this lesson continues throughout the rest of the module. Students read consistently each night for 20 minutes and answer a prompt of their choosing. From time to time, they will use class time to debrief what they are reading and how it connects to the module topic.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students finish reading chapter 5 and participate in a Language Dive to practice applying strategies to interpret the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary. They will also return to their work with summary writing and answering selected response questions by choosing the most effective summary of the chapter from several options.

- The independent research reading assignment launched in this lesson is referred to throughout this and the subsequent modules. Students have an opportunity to share their research reading in Unit 1, Lesson 11; Unit 2, Lesson 12; and Unit 3, Lesson 11.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare independent research reading journals. These should be a continuation of the journals begun in Module 1, although students may wish to start a fresh copy for the new topic.

- Become familiar with several of the books provided on the research reading list to direct students towards books that match their interests and reading levels.

- Preread chapter 5 in the anchor text to identify words or plot points that may challenge students.

- Prepare copies of handouts for students, including the entrance ticket (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Closing and Assessment A: Use video book trailers to introduce and build excitement for the research reading books.

- Closing and Assessment A: Use a free, online parent communication tool, such as http://eled.org/0120, to provide advance notice to parents about the expectations for independent reading at home.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.6.5 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 8**. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 8** (**example for teacher reference)** for possible responses.

- Using a preferred classroom routine, collect or review the answers to **Homework: Analyze Author Methods and Central Idea: “William Kamkwamba’s Electric Wind.”** Refer to **Homework: Analyze Author Methods and Central Idea: “William Kamkwamba’s Electric Wind” (answers for teacher reference)**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Opening

B. Launch Independent Research Reading (5 minutes)

- Launch independent reading for this module. There is a suggested independent reading launch in the **Independent Reading Sample Plans**. Urge students to choose a text before the end of the lesson.

Work Time

A. Read *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, Chapter 5 Excerpt (15 minutes)

- Explain that chapter 5 is an especially long chapter. Today students will read only from the beginning of the chapter on page 69 to page 83 ending at “‘ . . . that we stay alive.’”

- Repeated routine: Read the excerpt of chapter 5 of the **text**, using **Text Guide: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students who are ready to read independently or in small groups should be released to this independence. Students continue to unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary and reflect on their reading as they choose. Refer to the following resources as appropriate to support this section of the lesson: **vocabulary logs**, **Synopsis: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, **Chapter 5**, and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Remind students they will finish chapter 5 in the next lesson. For this reason, they will pause on determining gist and examining how the readers’ understanding of William is further developed by the methods used by the authors.

- Turn and Talk:

“Which habits of character did you practice as you read about the families who had run out of food? Why?” (Student responses will vary, but may include empathy and compassion because they were starving without food, and some of them were so weak they fainted.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

B. Analyze Structure: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, Chapter 4 – RI.6.1, RI.6.2, RI.6.3, RI.6.5 (15 minutes)

- Display and introduce the **Structure anchor chart**. Invite students to share the responses from the entrance ticket where they matched the types with their definitions and examples. Add the information to the chart. See **Structure anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**.

- Explain that they are going to apply this beginning understanding about structure types to a chapter in the text. Ask students to turn to chapter 4 in their texts and to recall the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment they completed in Lesson 6.

- Using a total participation technique, guide students through a series of questions to provide direct instruction on text structure:

“What is a central idea from chapter 4?” (Political and environmental events made things very different for the maize crop in the year 2010 than in other years.)

“Given the central idea we came up with, what structure might likely be used by this chapter? How do you know?” (Answers may vary. Students may say cause/effect and point to “events made things” as a signal; students might also say compare/contrast and point to the words “different” and “than.”)

“Take a look at the sentence after the break on page 67: ‘But that was in a normal year.’ How would you describe what the paragraphs leading up to that sentence describe or do?” (They describe the importance of maize to William and his family and detail the farming process from planting to harvest in a regular year.)

“How would you describe what the paragraphs that come after that sentence on page 67 describe or do?” (They describe the difficulties William’s family and community experienced in 2010 due to the political and environmental events.)

“Take another look at that sentence on page 67: Given what you noticed about what comes before and what comes after this sentence, how does this sentence seem to be functioning in the overall structure of this chapter? What is the purpose of this sentence?” (It provides the transition between the two things being discussed: regular years and the year 2010. It signals the overall structure, so we can better understand the content that has come before and get ready for the content to come. The use of the word *but* helps signal that structure as well.)

“How does this sentence help to convey the central idea that we identified?” (The central idea is about how 2010 was such a difficult year for William. This sentence marks a change in focus in the chapter. The chapter starts by describing the good years, and then this sentence interrupts and gets the reader ready for what’s to come: how bad the year 2010 was for William’s family and community in comparison to a normal year. If we didn’t have an understanding of how things usually went, readers would be less able to understand the seriousness of the situation for them in 2010.)

- As needed, cue students to think and process language internally:

“I’ll give you a minute to think and write or sketch.”

“I’ll give you time to discuss with your partner.”

- Invite students to share their ideas, while referencing and adding to the Structure anchor chart as appropriate.

- Sketch-Pair-Share:

“Take a minute to sketch your understanding of the compare-contrast structure as it is used in this chapter and explain it to your partner.” (Answers will vary. Students might draw two rectangles—one representing normal years and the other representing 2010—separated by a thin rectangle—representing the focus sentence.)

- Remind students that they learned about and practiced this structure in their writing during Module 1 when they compared and contrasted the experiences of watching the film and reading *The Lightning Thief*. Explain that over the next few lessons, they’ll examine other chapters to better understand other structures.

Closing and Assessment

A. QuickWrite: Analyze Structure – RI.6.5 (5 minutes)

- Distribute **QuickWrite: Analyze Structure, Chapter 5**. Remind students that the goal of a QuickWrite is to get their ideas on the page without pausing to edit for conventions. Refer to **QuickWrite: Analyze Structure, Chapter 5 (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

- Collect and review student responses, making note of students who might need support.

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.

For Lighter Support

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from chapter 5 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*. Provide ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Invite students who need lighter support to think about where the sentence might logically be broken up and predict the chunks they might see in the next lesson. Students may also wish to reflect on the function of the chunks they choose and practice assigning their chunks to the categories of the chunk wall.

For Heavier Support

- Provide ELLs who need heavier support with the Language Dive sentence for the following lesson. Encourage these students to independently reflect on this sentence and its meaning before the next lesson. Students may also wish to add any unknown vocabulary to their vocabulary logs.
