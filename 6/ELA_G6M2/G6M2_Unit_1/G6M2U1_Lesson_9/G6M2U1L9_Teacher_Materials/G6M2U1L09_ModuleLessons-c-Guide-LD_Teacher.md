**Sentence**

All that remained was one lonely hen, **who became a kind of morose symbol** of everything we’d lost. (from page 92 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* by William Kamkwamba and Bryan Mealer)

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Targets and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the Daily Learning Target **(I can determine the meaning of words as they are used in a text by identifying context clues)** and RI.6.4 and L.6.4a by inviting students to both use contextual evidence to determine a word’s meaning and interpret a metaphor that is related to a critical problem in the text.

- Supporting Standards: RI.6.1, SL.6.1.

- Guiding Question: The sentence helps students respond to the big idea that **ethical people contribute to a better world by applying their learning to help one’s school, community, and the environment** by illustrating a devastating problem within William’s community.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses a relative clause to add further information (**who became a kind of morose symbol**) and features a challenging academic word (**morose**). Invite students to discuss each chunk briefly, but encourage extended conversation and practice with the focus structure: **who became a kind of morose symbol**.

- Practice and Transfer: After discussing the focus structure, students practice using it to discuss something in their lives. Students transfer their understanding of the meaning and structure of this sentence during figurative language activities throughout Units 1 and 2.

Deconstruct

- Invite students to put their finger by this sentence from *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* on their note-catchers: **All that remained was one lonely hen, <u>who became a kind of morose symbol</u> of everything we’d lost.**

- Read aloud the sentence twice, and then ask students to take turns reading the sentence aloud with their partners.

- Say:

“What does this sentence mean to you?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“How does this sentence add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

All that remained was

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following sentence chunk strip: **All that remained was**

- Say:

“We have been reading chapter 5 of The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind for two days. What is this chapter mostly about?” (The famine in Malawi.)

- Display the sentence the precedes the Language Dive sentence in the text: **First of all, our chickens had died from disease a few weeks earlier because we couldn’t afford the medicine.**

- Say:

“This is the sentence that comes before our Language Dive sentence. Why couldn’t William and his family afford the medicine to feed their chickens?” (Because the drought had destroyed the crops and they had nothing to sell.)

- Draw student attention back to the sentence strip chunk.

- Say:

“Based on this context, what do you think is all that remained after the chickens died?” (Responses will vary, but may include answers like one chicken, chickens’ eggs, etc.)

one lonely hen,

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **one lonely hen,**

- Underline hen in blue, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 

- Say:

“What is a hen? Does anyone know what this word means?” (A female chicken.)

“Does anyone know the word for a male chicken?” (Rooster.)

“Why is the hen lonely?” (Responses will vary, but may include the following: because it is the only hen around, because it does not get enough attention.)

“Let’s imagine what this looks like. On your note-catchers, sketch a drawing of a lonely  
hen.” 

- After 30 seconds, encourage students to share their sketches with a partner or the group.

- Draw students’ attention back to the sentence strip chunk.

- Say:

“What punctuation mark does this chunk end in?” (A comma.)

“What might come next?” (Responses will vary, but may include the following: another item in a list, more information about the hen, some sort of conclusion.)

who became a kind of morose symbol of

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **who became a kind of morose symbol of**

- Underline who in blue, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 

- Say:

“Who or what does the word who refer to here?” (The lonely hen.)

- Remind students that this is called a relative pronoun. It introduces a relative clause. Relative clauses help us add extra information to a sentence without having to write a new sentence. A relative clause helps us be more specific.

- Underline symbol in blue, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 

- Say:

“What is a symbol?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to understand the general idea that symbol refers to an object that represents something else.)

“What could the lonely hen be a symbol of?” (Responses will vary.)

- Underline morose in yellow, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher.  Read the word aloud twice and ask students to repeat.

- Say:

“The word morose is describing the word symbol. Symbol is a noun. What part of speech is morose?” (Adjective.)

“Do you think the lonely hen was a positive, happy symbol or a negative, sad symbol? Why?” (Something sad; lonely is a sad word and this took place during a famine that was very difficult for people in Malawi.)

“Based on this, what do you think the word morose could mean?” (Responses will vary, but look for words like sad, serious, quiet).

- Display the definition of the word morose: very sad or unhappy. Congratulate students’ efforts on making guesses based on context. Invite them to add the definition of the word **morose** to their note-catchers. 

- Say:

“Why do you think the authors chose to use the word morose instead of the phrase very sad?” (Morose is a stronger, more precise, more academic word.)

“How does the author’s word choice impact your understanding of the sentence?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to understand that the word morose highlights how deeply sorrowful the lonely hen made William feel.)

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Display the sentence frame:

> **The empty maize bags in the storage shed became a morose symbol of \_\_\_\_\_.**

- Remind students that they have been reading about the maize in William’s family’s storage shed, and how William has noticed that more and more of the maize bags are empty and they are running out of food. Encourage students to return to page 78 and 79 to reread about the bags.

- Say:

“Use this frame to talk about what William is thinking or feeling when he sees more and more empty bags. What might these bags symbolize or represent to him? Discuss this with a partner. If you’d like, you can also add your answers to your note-catchers.” 

- If students seem stuck, consider providing an example: The empty maize bags in the storage shed became a morose symbol of <u>my family’s hunger</u>.

- After one minute, invite students’ responses.

everything we’d lost.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **everything we’d lost.**

- Say:

“What does this chunk mean to you?” (Responses will vary.)

“What had William and his family lost?” (Their food, their crops, the rest of their chickens, their feelings of safety.)

“How might a lonely hen be a symbol of what they had lost?” (Responses will vary, but may include that a lonely hen might remind William’s family of all the hens they once had.)

“How, then, does one lonely hen help represent a critical problem in the book?” (Families do not have enough food; they are suffering as a result of the famine.)

All that remained was one lonely hen, who became a kind of morose symbol of everything we’d lost.

Reconstruct

- Point to and read aloud the entire sentence on display: All that remained was one lonely hen, **who became a kind of morose symbol** of everything we’d lost.

- Say:

“How could this sentence be rewritten as two sentences?” (All that remained was one lonely hen. The hen became a kind of morose symbol of everything we’d lost.)

“Can you figure out why the writers used a relative clause to make this one sentence instead of two?” (To make the sentence more complex, to express an idea more completely.)

- Say:

“What other questions can we ask that will help us understand this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does this sentence relate to key ideas within this chapter?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to understand that this sentence highlights the impact of the famine.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the big idea that ethical people contribute to a better world by applying their learning to help one’s school, community, and the environment?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to notice that this sentence describes one of the ways in which William’s community needs help.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

> **(The) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ in the book *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* is**

noun phrase

> **a/an \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ symbol of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

adjective noun phrase

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use this frame to talk about another image in the text that could serve as a symbol of something else. Use your own words and work with your triad. Complete the frame on your note-catchers.” 

- Tell students that posting the chunks in language categories will help them use the language again for future speaking and writing tasks.

- Say and call on volunteers:

“All that remained was one lonely hen, who became a kind of morose symbol of everything we’d lost.”

“Now take each chunk and post it to the appropriate Language Chunk Wall. You can refer to these chunks again as you speak and write.”
