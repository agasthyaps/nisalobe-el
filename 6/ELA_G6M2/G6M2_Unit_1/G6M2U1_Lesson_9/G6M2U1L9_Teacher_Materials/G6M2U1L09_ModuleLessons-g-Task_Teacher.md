**Directions:** Read each option. Check the option that demonstrates the most effective summary of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* chapter 5. For the other three, explain what needs to be added or revised to make it an effective summary, based on the following criteria:

- Introduces the text by stating the title author, and chapter, section, or pages

- Briefly outlines what the text is about

- Clearly states the central idea(s)/main ideas

- Includes supporting details from the text that convey the central idea(s)/main ideas

- Remains objective without opinions or judgments

- “Wraps up” with a concluding statement

- Is short, clear, and concise

\_\_\_\_ In Chapter 5 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, William and the other members of his village become increasingly desperate as the famine continues. Many people have arrived in town hoping for *ganyu*. *Ganyu* means day labor. William’s mother manages to sell enough *zigumu* cakes in the market to afford food for one meal per family member per day. William’s favorite goat is sold to earn a little extra money. Khamba has become so hungry he can no longer hunt mice. Using his resourcefulness, William acquires goat skin which he boils for his Christmas dinner.

This summary does not state a central idea. It contains non-essential details and needs more key details from the chapter.

\_\_\_\_ In Chapter 5 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, William and the other members of his village become increasingly desperate as the famine continues. A central idea that I believe is conveyed by this chapter is that the effects of the drought are serious and widespread. William and those in his village are willing to do whatever is necessary to survive. William’s family decides to eat only one meal per day, which is definitely something I could never do.

This summary does not remain objective; it contains the writer’s opinions.
