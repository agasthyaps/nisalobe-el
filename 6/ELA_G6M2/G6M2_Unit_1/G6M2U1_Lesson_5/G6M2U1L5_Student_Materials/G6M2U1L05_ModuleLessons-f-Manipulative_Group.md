| William and Geoffrey tinker with a bike dynamo and manage to power a radio. They get so knowledgeable, others bring them their personal radios to repair.                                                                                       |
| Learning more about electricity becomes especially important to William because it is difficult and expensive to get electricity in Malawi. Electricity would solve many problems for his community, like being able to work or read past dark. |
| In chapter 3 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, William discovers that he enjoys taking apart machines and figuring out how they work.                                                                                                        |
| William is determined to find a way to bring electricity to his village. He focuses on studying hard for the Standard Eight exam to earn a spot in a good secondary school where he can learn science and solve this problem.                   |
