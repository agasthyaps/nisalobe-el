Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.6.3 – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they identify ways that the authors further the readers’ understanding of William in chapter 2 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*.

- RI.6.3 – Work Time A: After students complete chapter 3, they add to their Analyze Key Individual: William note-catchers.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time B: Students use evidence from the text to organize a summary of the central idea(s) of chapter 3.

- RI.6.2 – Work Time B: Students review principles of summary writing and arrange summary strips to produce an effective summary of chapter 3.

- In this lesson, students engage in a protocol. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. Students engage in the following new protocol in this lesson (instructions for which appear at the first point of use in the lesson):

- **Dance Card** sets up students with multiple, but consistent, partners for work across a unit, reducing the amount of energy and work it takes to assign partners. It allows students autonomy and choice in whom they pick for partner work. Students are likely familiar with the idea of partnering off for dancing, although the metaphor of the historical “dance card” may need to be explained. This protocol can involve any number of partners. Colors are used for ease of repeating the protocol, but the names on the dance cards could be changed to be pertinent to the unit of study (e.g., “dynamo,” “conductor,” and “generator”). To pre-assign a partnership for any reason, fill out two cards of matching color with the names to be matched and give them to the appropriate students before the dancing begins.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- William’s “discovery” of and fascination with science in this chapter provides a perfect entry point for cross curricular work between ELA and science class. Consider resources such as http://eled.org/0168 or http://eled.org/0169 for activities that allow students to combine their literacy skills with science explorations.

- An optional Mini Language Dive, intended for use after students complete chapter 3 in Work Time A, is available in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- In this lesson, students organize sentence strips to summarize chapter 3 of the text. To extend learning, invite students to use the criteria on the Criteria for an Effective Summary anchor chart to write their own summaries either independently or in triads, of chapter 3 rather than organizing the strips.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students read chapter 2 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* and determined its central idea. In this lesson they will continue in the anchor text, reading chapter 3.

- Students also build on work completed in Module 1 on summary writing as they review criteria for an effective summary. They assemble a summary of the chapter using sentence strips from a model summary.

Support All Students

- Note that there is a differentiated version of the entrance ticket used in Opening A in the ‘Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Students may struggle to read independently in the allotted time. Think about strategically grouping students of varying proficiency levels. ▲

- Chapter 3 first introduces readers to William’s sense of inquiry and love for science. These traits are important components of William’s identity and they are directly related to the overall topic of designing solutions to solve critical problems. For this reason, it is important that all students read this text carefully, for understanding of both its central idea(s) and details. Support developing readers, including ELLs, with guiding questions, extra time, highlighted attention to key paragraphs, and/or glossaries of key vocabulary terms. ▲

- Chapter 3 also describes an afternoon spent hunting, after which William and his friends “ate like men” (page 61). This casual description could be seen as male-centric. If female students feel excluded by references to only male characters, considering proposing an alternative writing assignment, where all students write short narratives from the perspectives of others in William’s family or community, such as his mother or his sisters.

- To further support students’ comprehension, additional time has been added into the schedule to allow students to capture important problem-solution information in their note-catchers and compare their findings with classmates.

- Students may need additional support with constructing the summary in Work Time B. Place these students in one group to receive additional support. In addition to verbally describing the directions for the summary strips activity, also create a chart with each step. Additionally, select a pair of students or model with a student how to effectively participate. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson revisits summary writing and reinforces students’ skills from Module 1. A Dance Card protocol during Closing and Assessment facilitates opportunities for students to collaborate with multiple classmates, challenging and strengthening their listening and speaking abilities. An optional Mini Language Dive offers the chance to dissect a specific sentence from *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, focusing specifically on the way the authors use punctuation to add information to a sentence.

- ELLs may find it challenging to move from identifying the central idea of a text to generating a summary of that text. This lesson scaffolds that transition by having students work in groups to rearrange prewritten summary strips to create an effective summary. This exercise reduces the amount of writing students are expected to produce, facilitates opportunities for students to grapple with classmates, and results in a model of a coherent and well-organized summary. Students can keep this model in mind during the mid-unit assessment of the following lesson, which features selected-response questions about the central idea of a chapter in *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.B.5, and 6.I.B.6.

Assessment Guidance

- Circulate and monitor discussions about summaries during Work Time B to check whether students are on the right track. Use common issues as teaching points for the whole group in the next lesson.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will complete the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment, for which they demonstrate their ability to determine the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary, identify a central idea of a text, and choose key details to support the central idea.

- Students will also read chapter 4 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.6.3 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 5** or the optional **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 5** ▲. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 5 (example for teacher reference)** for possible responses.

- Using a preferred classroom routine, collect or review the answers to **Homework: Analyze Vocabulary and Author Methods: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, **Chapter 2**. Refer to the **Homework: Analyze Vocabulary and Author Methods: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, **Chapter 2 (answers for teacher reference)**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- During Opening A, invite students who need heavier support to use the Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 5 ▲. This resource features sentence frames to support students’ writing and a glossary of keywords to enhance comprehension of task content.

Work Time

A. Read *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, Chapter 3 – RI.6.3 (25 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Read chapter 3 of the **text**, using **Text Guide: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*** (for teacher reference) for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students who are ready to read independently or in small groups should be released to this independence. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Refer to the following resources as appropriate to support this section of the lesson: **Gist anchor chart: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*** **(example for teacher reference)**, **vocabulary logs**, **Synopsis: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, **Chapter 3** and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Gist: William becomes curious about how things work and decides that he wants to be a scientist. He and Geoffrey spend a lot of time taking things, like radios, apart and putting them back together.

- Direct students to the **Author’s Methods anchor chart**. Provide or ask a student to read the definition of *anecdote* from the anchor chart. Refer to the **Author’s Methods anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**. Ask a student to rephrase the definition in their own words (a little story). Add this word to the **academic word wall**.

- Direct students to reread page 49 starting with “On weekends, Geoffrey and I . . . ” and ending on page 50 with “ . . . one day you’ll have a good job.”

- Turn and Talk:

“How does this excerpt match the definition of anecdote?” (It tells about when William and Geoffrey started fixing radios for the people in their community.)

“What do we learn about William from this anecdote?” (The anecdote helps readers understand that William has a spirit of inquiry and has a drive to figure out how things work.)

“What’s another time the authors use an anecdote to help develop our understanding of William and the ideas being conveyed in the text?” (In chapter 2, there is the story about William hunting with Kwamba which helps to convey that William has developed a special friendship with his dog, a dog he thought he didn’t want.)

- Repeated routine: Using strategic groupings, invite students to work with their peers to synthesize what they now know about William and complete the next row of their **Analyze Key Individual: William note-catcher**. Refer to the **Analyze Key Individual: William note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Use a total participation technique to review and correct any misunderstandings before moving on. Update the Author’s Methods anchor chart. Refer to the Author’s Methods anchor chart (example for teacher reference).

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time A, if students usually read in groups or with teacher support, challenge them to read chapter 3 independently. This will provide needed practice for students and help them better prepare for the mid-unit assessment of the following lesson, which requires students to read a chapter without external support.

- In Work Time A, after completing chapter 3, invite students to participate in a Mini Language Dive in small groups to better understand how to use dashes to set off parenthetical elements in their own writing (L.6.2a).

Work Time

B. Review Summary Writing – RI.6.2 (10 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can write an effective summary of chapter 3 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*.”

- Review criteria on the **Criteria for an Effective Summary anchor chart**.

- Remind students of the summary work they did during Module 1 and explain that they will continue to practice and refine their summary skills in this module with informational texts. Also remind them how the work with central idea in the previous lesson will help to support their summary work in this and upcoming lessons.

- Turn and Talk:

“Why do we write summaries?” (To help us synthesize and make meaning of our understanding of the text; to convey that understanding to others.)

- Turn and Talk:

“Which criterion do you find most challenging to include when writing a summary?” (Answers will vary. Listen for students to make a direct reference to a single criterion on the anchor chart in their response.)

- Group students into triads. Distribute the **Chapter 3 Summary Strips** and **scissors**. Invite students to cut the strips on the dotted lines. Explain that students will rearrange the sentences to make an effective summary for an informational text according to the criteria on the anchor chart.

- Focus students on the Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart; review *empathy* and *respect* and what they look and sound like. Remind students to show empathy and respect as they work in their triads on this activity.

- Invite students to begin. Circulate and monitor student progress. Allow students to grapple, and encourage them to look to each other to come up with answers. Cue students to listen carefully to one another:

“Who can repeat what your classmate said? Who can tell us what your classmate said in your own words?”

- After 5 minutes, refocus whole group. Display the **Chapter 3 Summary Strips (answer for teacher reference)**, and invite triads to check their work against the model. Number the criteria on the Criteria for an Effective Summary anchor chart, then number where each criterion appears on the displayed answer key. Students should follow along by pointing to the corresponding sentence strips in their student summary.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Closing and Assessment

A. Small Group Discussion: Dance Card Protocol – SL.6.1 (5 minutes)

- Explain that students will use a protocol called Dance Card for occasional small group discussions. The purpose of this particular protocol is to move into groups quickly while still allowing for a variety of partners.

- Read aloud and ensure students understand the directions for Dance Card. (Refer to the **Classroom Protocols document** for the full version of the protocol.)

- Guide students through the protocol.

- Give the **three colored index cards** to each student. Students write their name on each card.

- Signal to “dance,” and have students find one partner to trade their blue card with and write their own name on that partner’s card. This pair becomes blue “dance card” partners. Then direct students to do the same with their red card, green card, etc. (or whatever colors or group names are being used). Optionally, for fun or to fill a need for movement, students can dance over to do their trade, do a quick dance after the trade (e.g., the chicken dance), or you can play music during this transition. Remind students that they can only pair up together for one of their colors. They must end up with as many different partners as they have colored index cards.

- Once all rounds are complete, invite students to either staple their cards together for safekeeping or record their partners’ names on the dance card.

- At the end of the protocol, each student has different partners for discussion to be used repeatedly, but with variety, throughout the unit. When it is time for students to pair up, direct them to their “blue dance partner,” “red dance partner,” and so on.

- Refocus whole group, and name a dance partner group for students to join.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What habits of character does William demonstrate so far?”

- Circulate and monitor student responses. Make note of students who might need support and check in with them moving forward.

Homework

A. Analyze Vocabulary and Central Idea

- Students complete **Homework: Analyze Vocabulary and Central Idea:** ***The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, **Chapter 3** to analyze vocabulary in context and central idea.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread chapter 4 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* in preparation for studying the chapter in the next lesson.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- The mid-unit assessment of the following lesson may be intimidating for some students, especially if these students usually read in class with considerable support from classmates or the teacher. As homework, invite these readers to reread chapters 1–3. Rereading familiar text improves fluency and reading speed, crystallizes understanding of the text’s central idea(s), and may help increase students’ confidence before the mid-unit assessment.
