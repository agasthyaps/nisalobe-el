Synopsis: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, Chapter 10

**Name:** **Date:**

- William returns to school only to find out he must pay last term’s fees as well as this term’s fees. William resorts to sneaking into the classroom with his friends.

- Mr. Kamkwamba speaks to the teachers at the school. They agree to letting William stay in school as long as the fees are paid soon.

- The tobacco crop is ready, and Mr. Kamkwamba pays off his debts incurred during the famine.

- The money available after the tobacco sales is enough to help the family but not enough to pay for William’s school. Once again, William drops out of school.

- The maize is ready for harvest and the Kamkwamba family harvests the best crop they have had in years.

- After the harvest, William returns to the scrapyard to collect materials for the windmill.

- William persuades his father to sacrifice a bicycle to support William’s plan.

- The students at Kachokolo shout insults at William for rifling through garbage in the scrapyard. William’s mother complains to her husband about William’s behavior, but Mr. Kamkwamba sticks up for William.

- By picking up odd jobs in the market, William makes enough money to get a shock absorber welded to the bicycle. Gilbert buys screws, bolts, nuts, and a dynamo for the windmill.
