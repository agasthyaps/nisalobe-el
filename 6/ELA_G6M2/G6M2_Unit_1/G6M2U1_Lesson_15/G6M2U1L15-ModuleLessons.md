Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.6.7 – Work Time A: Students continue to add to the Design Solution: William note-catcher, integrating information about William from multiple sources.

- W.6.8 – Work Time A: Students continue to gather information from multiple sources on their Design Solution: William note-catchers.

- SL.6.2 – Work Time A: Students interpret information from diverse media and formats on their Design Solution: William note-catchers.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time B: Students participate in a text-based discussion about *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, using textual evidence to support their analysis of what the text says.

- SL.6.1a – Work Time B: Students participate in a text-based discussion, drawing upon their preparation in past lessons.

- SL.6.1b – Work Time B: Students participate in a text-based discussion, following rules for a collegial discussion.

- SL.6.1b – Closing and Assessment A: Students complete a QuickWrite in which they debrief the text-based discussion of Work Time B, reflecting on their goals.

- In this lesson, the habit of character focus is on working to become an ethical person. The characteristics that students practice are respect, empathy, and compassion as they participate in a text-based discussion.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Students who are capable of multitasking may enjoy collecting data during the discussion by mapping the conversation. Explain that mapping a discussion means to create a visual representation of the flow of the conversation, with all participants’ names indicating their position in the room and arrows to track the sequence of contributions. Mapping a conversation includes adding notes about how the students participated and highlighting what they did well in both the content they added to the discussion and their use of the discussion norms. If multiple students participate in this protocol, they could compare their maps and their insights at the conclusion of the discussion.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students prepared for this discussion by completing relevant parts of the Design Solution: William note-catcher with evidence from *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* and the other supplementary materials to answer the prompt, “What critical problems does William face? What makes them <u>critical</u>?”

Support All Students

- Chapter 10 refers to disparities in opportunity for boys and girls in Malawi. One passage on page 170 is especially deserving of scrutiny: “At least with daughters, a Malawian father can hope they’ll marry a husband who can provide a home and food and help them continue their schooling. But with a boy, it was different. My education meant everything to my father.” Also, on page 175, William describes forbidding his sisters “from even entering \[his\] room to sweep and mop.” If time allows, encourage students to challenge, in writing or aloud with partners, the sexism underlying these attitudes about the expectations of girls versus boys.

- ELLs may feel especially nervous to participate in a formal class discussion. Help them recognize the ways in which they have prepared themselves to answer this question over the course of the unit and especially during the last two lessons. Remind them that this is not an assessment, but rather an opportunity to collaborate with classmates and practice for a similar discussion in the End of Unit 3 Assessment. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson features a text-based discussion for which students have spent two lessons preparing. A subsequent QuickWrite encourages reflection and improves students’ investment in their own learning and progress. The Fishbowl protocol of this text-based discussion is used again during the End of Unit 3 Assessment. Practicing this protocol here in Unit 1, without being formally assessed, is a useful way to increase ELLs’ confidence and preparedness for the formal assessment of a later unit.

- ELLs may find it challenging to read chapter 10 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* immediately before participating in the Fishbowl discussion. If students did not preread the chapter the night before, encourage them to rely on the summary resources as needed during Work Time A. Reading a smaller amount of text may help students who need heavier support preserve the cognitive energy necessary for successful participation in the text-based discussion.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.2, 6.I.A.3, 6.I.A.4, 6.I.B.5, and 6.I.B.6.

Assessment Guidance

- Consider using the Collaborative Discussion checklist (see Assessment Overview and Resources) to provide students feedback and prepare them for the End of Unit 3 Assessment.

- Prepare for the facilitation of this lesson by mentally running through a mock discussion, asking questions such as, “What responses do I actually expect students to give?” Prepare a list of a few prompting questions to spark engagement if the conversation lulls during the mock discussion.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will commence Unit 2 of this module, in which they analyze the development of a character and identify themes in a text.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Preread chapter 10 in the anchor text to identify words or plot points that may challenge students.

- Determine student groups (of five) for the text-based discussion, as well as the order in which groups will discuss and provide feedback, and post this information.

- Review the procedure for the Fishbowl protocol, which can be found online in the EL Education: Classroom Protocols document (see the Tools page: http://eled.org/tools).

- Prepare copies of handouts for students (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time B: Record students as they engage in text-based discussions to listen to later. This resource can aid in noting strengths and areas of improvement, or to use as models for the group. Most devices (cell phones, tablets, laptop computers) come equipped with free video and audio recording apps or software.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.6.1 (5 minutes)

- As students enter class, direct them to read the learning targets, then retrieve their **Design Solution: William note-catcher**.

- Direct students to the final row in section D (Reflection) of the note-catcher: What habits of character are evident in this experience?

- Rephrase the question to explain that they should fill in the box with examples of the habits of character William has demonstrated so far in the text. Prompt them to be specific and choose a variety of habits to cover. Refer to **Design Solution: William note-catcher (example for teacher reference)**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, Chapter 10 – RI.6.7 (25 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Read chapter 10 of the **text**, using **Text Guide: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students who are ready to read independently or in small groups should be released to this independence. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Refer to the following resources as appropriate to support this section of the lesson: **Gist anchor chart: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*** **(example for teacher reference)**, **Synopsis: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, **Chapter 10**, **vocabulary logs**, and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Gist: Malawi is finally recovering from the famine with a good harvest. William still does not have enough money to pay the school fees. He spends his time tinkering in the scrapyard instead, working on his windmill.

- Turn and Talk:

“Which habits of character did you practice as you read about William having his name called and having to leave the classroom?” (Student responses will vary, but may include empathy and compassion because William was so upset, he cried.)

- Direct students to return to their Design Solution: William note-catcher. Direct students to Part I, section C. Design Solution. Work as a class, using whatever level of modeling or thinking-aloud best support students, or have students work in pairs to continue working on this section, adding to it with the new information from chapter 10. Refer to the Design Solution: William note-catcher (examples for teacher reference) as necessary.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

B. Discuss Critical Problems – SL.6.1 (10 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can effectively participate in the Fishbowl protocol by following the norms and procedures.”

- Focus students on the **Discussion Norms anchor chart**, specifically on the cues and responses. Remind them that a discussion is not just about saying what they want to say and then they are done. Effective participation is about listening to others and asking and answering questions to be completely clear about what others are saying and to clarify their own points.

- Direct students to Part I, section A. General Overview and section B. Critical Problem of their Design Solution: William note-catcher.

- Direct students to retrieve their **Fishbowl Discussion checklist**, and assign or let students choose a partner to observe.

- Direct students’ attention to the Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart. Focus students on empathy, respect, and compassion, and remind them to attend to these habits of character as they discuss.

- Situate students in an inner and an outer circle. Remind the students in the outer circle to observe their partner in the inner circle.

- Begin the discussion with the inner circle participants by reminding them of the prompt:

“What critical problems does William face? What makes them <u>critical</u>?”

- Refer to Part I, sections A and B of Design Solution: William note-catcher (for teacher reference). After 4 minutes, invite the outer circle to offer kind, helpful, and specific feedback to the inner circle based on their notes on the Fishbowl Discussion checklist. Then swap places, and continue the discussion. Remind the students on the new outer circle, to observe their partners in the inner circle this time. Use probing questions to restart the discussion if it stalls.

- Refocus whole group.

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time B, implement a variation to the Fishbowl protocol in which mixed-proficiency pairs are assigned and students are responsible for specifically noting the responses of their partners and providing stars and steps one-on-one in a future lesson.

For Heavier Support

- If needed during Work Time B, host two separate Fishbowl discussions with two different groups. Group students who need heavier support together for closer monitoring and more processing time. These discussions can be held concurrently, or one after the other with the non-Fishbowl group reading chapter 10 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*.

Closing and Assessment

A. QuickWrite: Debrief Fishbowl Discussion – SL.6.1b (5 minutes)

- Explain that reflecting on the process of learning can be as important as reflecting on the content learned. Distribute the **QuickWrite: Debrief Fishbowl Discussion** handout, and direct students to begin. Refocus whole group after 4 minutes.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Apply Design Thinking

- Students continue working on Part I, sections A, B, and C of the Design Solution: William note-catcher. Invite students to also add relevant information from the TED Talk and/or “William Kamkwamba’s Electric Wind.”

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
