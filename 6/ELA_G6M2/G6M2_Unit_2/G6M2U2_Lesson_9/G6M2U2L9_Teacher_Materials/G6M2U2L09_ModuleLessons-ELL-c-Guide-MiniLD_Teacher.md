5-Minute Mini Language Dive

RI.6.1, RI.6.4, RI.6.7, SL.6.1, L.6.5c

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

**They poured out of the car** with their cameras and tape recorders, and flocked around the windmill. (from page 247 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* by William Kamkwamba and Bryan Mealer)

**Lesson 9 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after students read the chapter 14 excerpt of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* in Work Time A.

**Rationale**

- Guiding Question and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the guiding question (what habits of character can help solve a critical problem to contribute to a better community?) by suggesting that many people are coming to see William and admire his work because he has taken on a critical problem in his community. This sentence also helps students address RI.6.4, RI.6.7, and L.6.5c by featuring words with specific connotations that students can interpret (**poured**; **flocked**) and by facilitating opportunities to compare a textual description to photos of the same event.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it contains verbs and prepositional phrases with particular connotations to emphasize the density of a crowd.

- Transfer: Subject + verb + prepositional phrase + prepositional phrase, **and** verb + prepositional phrase = to add context and precise details to their descriptions of problems and solutions in Unit 3.

**Deconstruct**

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **They poured out of the car** with their cameras and tape recorders, and flocked around the windmill.

- Say:

“What is this sentence about?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Draw students’ attention to the pronoun **they**.

- Say:

“Whom is this pronoun referring to? Who are they? Look on page 247 if you don’t remember.” (Reporters from important media organizations in Malawi.)

“Based on your understanding of this chapter, why are these reporters coming to see William?” (Because they want to see the windmill that he invented.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **They poured out of the car**

- Draw students’ attention to the verb and prepositional phrase **poured out of.**

“Does anyone know what poured out of means? What kinds of things can usually pour or be poured? What do these things pour out of?” (To flow or move in a continuous stream or to cause something else to flow; usually, people pour liquids; they are usually poured out of some kind of receptacle, like a cup.)

“This chunk says that people poured out of the car. What does this mean to you?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to understand that many people were exiting the car continuously.)

“What other verbs could the writers have used instead of poured to describe this scene?” (Came out of; exited.)

**Reconstruct**

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **<u>They poured out of the car</u> with their cameras and tape recorders, and flocked around the windmill.**

- Say:

“What other words or details do the writers use in this sentence to emphasize that there were many people visiting William and his windmill?” (The word flocked and the mention of cameras and tape recorders all suggest a crowd.)

“Why do you think the writers chose the structure poured out of instead of a similar structure like exited from?” (To emphasize that there were many people visiting William and his windmill.)

- If needed, provide a definition of the word **flocked:** to gather or move in a crowd. Point out that the word **flocked** is usually used to refer to groups of birds.

“Why do you think the writers chose the structure flocked around instead of a similar alternative like gathered around?” (To again emphasize that there were many people visiting William’s windmill; perhaps to emphasize that the people were chattering and/or moving as a crowd.)

- If time allows, invite students to visit the photos in the middle of their anchor texts. On the penultimate page of photos, there is an image titled, “Journalists visiting my windmill.” Ask students to compare this photo and its caption to their understanding of the sentence. How does the photo enhance their understanding of the scene described in the text?

- Say:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question: What habits of character can help solve a critical problem to contribute to a better community?” (Responses will vary. If needed, rephrase this question to ask, “What critical problem is William trying to solve for his community? What habits of character do his attempts reveal?”)

**Practice**

- Display the following new sentence, taken directly from the text, and the frame below it, which replaces moved through with a blank space.

> **“For two hours, they moved through the house, elbowing and shoving one another to get the** **best pictures of my switches and battery system.”**
>
> **For two hours, they \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ the house, elbowing and shoving one another to get the** **best pictures of my switches and battery system.**

- Say:

“Think about words and prepositions with similar meanings that the writers could have used instead of moved through. With your partners, discuss how the connotations of these different words affect the meaning of the sentence.”

- Sample responses:

> **For two hours, they <u>pushed through</u>** **the house, elbowing and shoving one another to get the best pictures of my switches and battery system—<u>makes the reporters seem more aggressive.</u>**
>
> **For two hours, they <u>walked around</u>** **the house, elbowing and shoving one another to get the best pictures of my switches and battery system**—**<u>makes the reporters’ actions less specific or urgent.</u>**
