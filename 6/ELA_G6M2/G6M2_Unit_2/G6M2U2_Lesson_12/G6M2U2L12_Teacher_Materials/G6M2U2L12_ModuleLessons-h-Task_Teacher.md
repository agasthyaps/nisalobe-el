What similarities are there between William Kamkwamba and the innovator you are researching? Focus your evidence on design thinking and habits of character.

Answers will vary. Sample response: My research is focused on Ann Makosinski, who won the Google Science Fair by designing a Hollow Flashlight. The flashlight runs on body heat and requires no batteries or electricity. Ann is similar to William in that they both came up with their designs to help provide light to those who don’t have electricity. Ann designed the Hollow Flashlight to help a friend who was failing at school because she couldn’t study at night without light. William and his sisters also couldn’t do their school work at night either. They both had to work to improve their designs several times before they were successful. Even after she got her flashlight to work, Ann found that the light tended to shine brighter as the outside air got colder. She redesigned it to ensure that the light would be appropriately bright in all temperatures. William and Ann both demonstrated compassion by designing their inventions to help others in need.
