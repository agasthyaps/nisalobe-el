**Sentence**

**Where the world sees trash,** Africa recycles. (from page 265 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* by William Kamkwamba)

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the Daily Learning Target (**I can determine the words and meanings of phrases as they are used in the text**) and L.6.3a, L.6.4a, and L.6.5 by inviting opportunities to practice combining ideas using conjunctions, requiring clarification of a word with multiple meanings (**where**), and using a conjunction (**where**) to highlight relationships among words and ideas. Supporting Standards: RI.6.1, SL.6.1

- Guiding Question: The sentence helps students respond to the guiding question (**What habits of character can help solve a critical problem to contribute to a better community?**) by illustrating an example of taking initiative and applying one’s learning to help their community.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses a conjunction to describe contrast simply and briefly and because it uses a familiar word in a potentially unfamiliar way (**where** as a conjunction to signal contrast, rather than an adverb to signal location). Invite students to discuss each chunk briefly, but encourage extended conversation and practice with the focus structure: **Where the world sees trash**.

- Practice and Transfer: After discussing the focus structure, students practice using it to discuss something in their lives. Students transfer their understanding of the meaning and structure of this sentence when writing essays about critical problems and the innovators who solved them in Unit 3. For example, the focus structure may be adapted and used by students to highlight the ways in which the unique abilities, perspectives, or habits of character of their innovators helped distinguish their solutions from others’ solutions.

- Delivery: The chunks are presented out of order to provide context and allow for better understanding and discussion.

**Key**

Red

Green

Deconstruct

- Invite students to put their finger by this sentence from *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* on their note-catchers: **<u>Where the world sees trash,</u> Africa recycles.**

- Read aloud the sentence twice, and then ask students to take turns reading the sentence aloud with their partners.

- Say:

“What does this sentence mean to you?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“How does this sentence add to your understanding of the guiding question, ‘What habits of character can help solve a critical problem to contribute to a better community?’” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

recycles.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following sentence chunk strip: **recycles.**

- Say:

“Where in the sentence does this chunk occur? How do you know?” (At the end; it ends in a period.)

- Underline recycles in red, and invite students to do the same on their note-catchers. 

- Say:

“What kinds of things can usually be recycled?” (Any used or unwanted items, especially those made of plastic, glass, paper, etc.; make sure to push students beyond the idea of recycling as simply placing something in a special bin.)

“Do you or your family recycle? What do you recycle?” (Student responses will vary but may include cans, plastic bottles, clothing.)

“What are some of the items that William recycled in the text?” (An old motor from a radio; pieces of a ballpoint pen; bike tires.)

“What habits of character did William demonstrate when he found different uses for all of these items?” (He shows initiative; he uses his strengths to help others; he applies his learning to help his community.)

Africa

Deconstruct

- Remind students that William, the narrator of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, is from the African country Malawi.

“What do you think this chunk means when it says that Africa recycles?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to understand that perhaps this chunk means that William’s resourcefulness and care for his community is not unique to him, but can found in other parts of the continent too.)

“If we don’t recycle a used and unwanted item, what happens to it?” (It becomes trash; we throw it away.)

- Explain to students that this statement seems to be suggesting that everyone in Africa recycles. Remind students that Africa is a continent with many countries, and many millions of people. As a result, it is unlikely that everyone in Africa recycles. Compare it to the idea of saying the same thing about the United States. Ensure students understand the danger of statements like this in telling just one story about Africa to people, particularly if they have never been there.

Where the world sees trash,

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **Where the world sees trash,**

- Underline Where in green, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 

- Say:

“How do we usually use the word where?” (To refer to places or locations.)

“Based on what we know about the other chunks, however, what do you think where mean here?” (It means contrast; it introduces difference.)

- Point out that a simple synonym for **where** is **whereas**.

- Draw student attention back to the entire chunk. Say:

“What does it mean that the world sees trash? How might this be a figurative use of the word sees?” (In this context, sees means thinks of something in a certain way, rather than look at with your eyes.)

“How is the meaning of this chunk different from the first chunk, Africa recycles?” (This chunk shows a different perspective towards waste; this chunk emphasizes a distinction between Africa and the rest of the world.)

“If these two chunks show such contrasting ideas, what do you think the final chunk might be?” (A word or phrase that indicates contrast.)

“Can you think of some words or phrases that writers and speakers use to show contrast? Write some of these words and phrases on your note-catchers.”  (Although; however; whereas; but.)

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Display the sentence frame:

**Where my friend \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, I \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

independent clause independent clause

(conjunction + independent clause, independent clause)

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use this frame to talk about a difference between you and a friend. Use your own words with your partners.”

Where the world sees trash, Africa recycles.

Reconstruct

- Point to and read the entire sentence on display: **<u>Where the world sees trash,</u> Africa recycles.**

- Say:

“Is it possible to move around the chunks without disrupting the meaning of the sentence?” (Yes; “where Africa recycles, the world sees trash” has a very similar meaning.)

“Why do you think this sentence was uttered as Where the world sees trash, Africa recycles instead of Where Africa recycles, the world sees trash?” (Responses will vary, but may include the following: because the first version shows a problem before a solution, which probably makes more sense to the readers and listeners.)

- Say:

“What other questions can we ask that will help us understand this sentence?”  
(Responses will vary.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question, ‘What habits of character can help solve a critical problem to contribute to a better community?’” (Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display the following sentences:

**William’s community sees \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

**William sees \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“First, think about a perspective that William has that makes him different from other people in his community. What is something that he ‘sees’ differently from his community? Fill in the sentence frames with your answer. Then, practice combining these contrasting ideas using words that signal contrast. First, use the word where. Then, use the word whereas or but. Depending on the words you choose, you may have to reorganize certain parts of your sentence.” 

- Give students 1 minute to complete the frames, and then combine them into a single sentence. Invite students to share answers.

- Answers will vary, but may include the following:

**Where William’s community sees despair, William sees opportunity.**

**William’s community sees a broken radio, but William sees a windmill.**

- Say:

“Which of your sentence patterns do you prefer in terms of meaning, interest, or style? Why?”
