Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.6.7 – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they compare and contrast information presented in different formats.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time A: Students participate in a Language Dive, using textual evidence from a sentence of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* to support their analysis of key ideas in the text.

- RI.6.4 – Work Time A: During the Language Dive, students determine the meaning of a conjunction as it is used in a sentence from the text.

- L.6.4a – Work Time A: During the Language Dive, students use context to determine the precise meaning of a word with multiple meanings used in the text.

- RI.6.7 – Closing and Assessment A: Students complete a QuickWrite in which they integrate information presented in different formats to reflect upon and record their thoughts about *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* and their current research.

- In Work Time B of this lesson, students are guided through a research reading share to hold them accountable for their research reading homework. Consider using Independent Reading Sample Plans (see the Tools page: http://eled.org/tools) if not using established independent reading review routines.

- The research reading that students complete for homework helps build both their vocabulary and knowledge pertaining to design solutions, specifically the design thinking process. By participating in this volume of reading over time, students will develop a wide base of knowledge about the world and the words that help describe and make sense of it.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become ethical people by showing integrity as they share and discuss the independent reading they have been doing regularly for homework.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Students who seek another outlet for recording their independent research journal responses may begin a vlog documenting their experience with the independent text.

- Students who show great interest in and an advanced understanding of the design thinking process may serve as discussion captains during the independent research reading share.

- Students may offer additional writing prompts to add to the independent research reading list.

- Due to limits in class time, students do not read chapter 15 in its entirety during class. Consider introducing an extension activity that invites students to read from page 271 (beginning at “Over time, Gerry became a great friend and teacher”) to the first line on page 273. This passage describes the challenges William faces as he learns English. Students can write responses to this passage based on the prompts “What does this passage suggest about the challenges of learning a new language?” or, for ELLs, “How are William’s feeling about learning English similar to or different from my own?” This activity may be especially affirming to ELLs, who are likely to identify with the struggles and successes of William’s language-learning process. ▲

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Students are continuing to build their vocabulary skills by using strategies to determine the meaning of words and phrases. In this lesson, students participate in a Language Dive in which they use context to interpret the precise meaning of a word with multiple meanings.

- Students began their independent research reading in Unit 1. In this lesson, the students have an opportunity to share what additional knowledge they’ve gained regarding design solutions and specifically the design thinking process.

Support All Students

- The Language Dive of this lesson is intended to facilitate a “pause” that allows readers to dig more deeply into the meaning of a sentence from *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*. Language Dives are critical for the development of ELLs’ reading and linguistic skills. To help students begin to connect the strategies of the Language Dive to their own independent reading, writing, and speaking, debrief by encouraging students to identify new strategies they learned or insights they gleaned. ▲

- Students may need additional support with recording their answers on their note-catchers. Consider sitting those students in a group together for additional support when necessary. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson features the second Language Dive of the unit, which highlights a sentence from the final chapter of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind.* Also in this lesson, students share their Independent Research Reading, giving them a space to celebrate their own learning and share content knowledge with their classmates.

- ELLs may find it challenging to mentally juggle and keep distinct their understandings of the anchor text, their research texts, and their independent reading texts. Encourage the use of visuals or graphic organizers to help students keep track of the central idea(s) and key takeaways from all texts. Also, if possible to do so, create time for students to celebrate having completed the anchor text. Students do not read the epilogue in class, but instead are encouraged to read it on their own later; design a supplemental reflective activity that asks students to process their thoughts at the close of the novel and celebrates their having completed another novel in English.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.3, 6.II.A.1, 6.II.C.6, and 6.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- During the research reading share in Work Time B, work with individuals reviewing their independent reading journals, holding them accountable for independent reading.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will analyze a model problem-solution essay in scaffolded preparation to write their own essay.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.6.7 (10 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 12**. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 12 (example for teacher reference)** for possible responses. Students will also need their text, ***The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Language Dive: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, Page 265 – L.6.4a (10 minutes)

- Tell students they will now participate in a Language Dive to use context to determine the meaning of words with multiple meanings and to highlight relationships between words and ideas using conjunctions in *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*. Distribute **markers or colored pencils** (red and green) to each student.

- Explain that students will not read chapter 15 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* in its entirety. Provide the **Synopsis: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, **Chapter 15** if students require more context for the excerpt being read for the Language Dive.

- Reread aloud the excerpt from *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* on pages 264–265, starting at “There was Corneille Ewango” on page 264 and ending with “Where the world sees junk, Africa sees rebirth” on page 265.

- Turn and Talk:

“What did all of the people speaking at the TED Talk have in common?” (Student responses will vary, but may include they were contributing to a better world. They were doing things to improve the lives of others.)

- Focus students on the sentence:

- “Where the world sees trash, Africa recycles.”

- Use the **Language Dive Guide:** ***The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind,*** **Page 265** to guide students through a Language Dive conversation about the sentence. Distribute and display the **Language Dive:** ***The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind,*** **Page 265 note-catcher** and the **Language Dive:** ***The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind,*** **Page 265 sentence chunk strips**. Refer to the **Language Dive: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, **Page 265 note-catcher (example for teacher reference**) as necessary.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- The Language Dive of Work Time A highlights the following sentence from the anchor text: “Where the world sees trash, Africa recycles” (265). As an extension to this Language Dive, invite students to generate their own second Language Dive, focusing on the sentence that follows in the text: “Where the world sees junk, Africa sees rebirth.” Challenge students to produce questions that highlight significant patterns and language in this sentence. If time allows, ask students to share their Language Dives with students who need heavier support.

For Heavier Support

- The Language Dive of Work Time A highlights the following sentence from the anchor text: “Where the world sees trash, Africa recycles” (265). In order to emphasize the distinction between the two independent clauses in this sentence, consider an extension in which pairs receive images or descriptions of unwanted items that might be seen as trash (e.g., empty water bottles; a pile of newspapers; a broken TV). Invite students to generate creative alternative uses for these items.

Work Time

B. Share Independent Research Reading – RI.6.10 (20 minutes)

- Refer to the **Independent Reading Sample Plans** to guide students through a research reading share or use another routine.

- Remind students that the purpose of research reading is to build their content knowledge, domain-specific vocabulary, and achievement on reading complex texts. As necessary, use the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart** to review *integrity*. Students demonstrate integrity by keeping up with their independent research reading even though it can be challenging.

Closing and Assessment

A. QuickWrite: Connect Anchor Text to Research – RI.6.7 (5 minutes)

- Distribute the **QuickWrite: Connect Anchor Text to Research**. Explain that students will have time now to reflect upon and record their thoughts about *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* and their current research. Refer to the **QuickWrite: Connect Anchor Text to Research (example for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Encourage students to write continuously until time is up. Collect student responses to review later. Plan to check in with students who may be struggling.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- To further support students during Closing and Assessment A as they identify connections between William and the person they are researching, draw a simple graphic organizer on their QuickWrite prompts. A Venn diagram, for example, may help ELLs visually represent differences and similarities between the two innovators, as well as reduce the amount of writing expected.

Homework

A. Read Anchor Text

- Students are encouraged to read the epilogue of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
