Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.6.7 – Work Time A: During a research mini lesson, students interpret a design process graphic and use the visual information it conveys to support their understanding of their own research process.

- W.6.8 – Work Time A: During a research mini lesson, students practice skimming and scanning a TED Talk transcript, and then watch the TED Talk to extract relevant details and important information.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time B: Students continue to conduct research, using textual evidence to support their analysis of a critical problem and its design solution.

- W.6.7 – Work Time B: Students continue to conduct research, preparing to draw on multiple sources.

- W.6.8 – Work Time B: Students continue to conduct research, gathering information from sources and assessing the validity of their sources.

- SL.6.2 – Work Time B: Students continue to conduct research, interpreting information presented in a video and using a note-catcher to explain how the information contributes to the topic under study.

- RI.6.7 – Closing and Assessment A: Students participate in a small group discussion to compare and contrast William’s design process with that of the innovators they selected, helping students to develop a more coherent understanding of their topics.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Students who have experience with any of the research steps could be authorized as experts on those steps and allowed to teach or mentor the class or individual students on the steps.

- Invite students to extend their research beyond TED Talks based on ideas they may have read about in independent reading texts.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students continued viewing TED Talks to determine their topic and gathered broad ideas on their Design Solution: Research note-catcher. In this lesson, students will gather specific, relevant information about how their chosen innovator tackled a critical problem by following the design thinking process.

Support All Students

- The work of Avery Bang and the Bridges to Prosperity organization is highlighted in this lesson because it shows a clear example of design thinking to solve a critical problem. This organization works collaboratively with community members in rural communities to build bridges to connect them with access to education, health care, and opportunities to earn money. Ensure students understand the importance of this collaboration with the community.

- ELLs may find it challenging to independently watch, comprehend, and select from the list of TED Talks. Consider providing short, simple blurbs of two or three talks for students to read before they watch the videos. Additionally, many TED Talks feature the option of adding subtitles or slowing down speech. Transcripts are also often available (sometimes in more than one language). Acquaint students with these functions and encourage students to use them as necessary to support their understanding of the videos. ▲

- Students may vary in their familiarity with what information is important to write down and which information is not so important. Be sure to lift up the purpose of the specific questions on the note-catcher so students do not become overwhelmed when selecting evidence.

- Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this lesson that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually.

- To support ELLs, this lesson builds upon students’ developing research skills, targeting their ability to skim and scan a text for interesting information or relevant evidence to support a claim. After watching the teacher model the process, students practice skimming and scanning transcripts of TED Talks for key information before watching TED Talk: Avery Bang: “Building Bridges and Connecting Communities” to confirm that they have indeed isolated the most important pieces. This exercise supports ELLs in three ways: (1) it promotes reading fluency by requiring that students quickly decode text for a specific purpose, (2) it integrates reading and listening skills, allowing strengths in one sphere to support performance in the other, and (3) it includes built-in reinforcement of content by asking students to engage with the same information twice, in two modes.

- ELLs may find it challenging to isolate particular pieces of evidence in a video, especially if their listening comprehension skills are lower. Point out that the TED Talk transcripts are meant as a resource to enhance their comprehension of the video. If it is possible to do so, invite students to print the transcripts of their TED Talks and demonstrate active reading and listening by marking them up with notes, questions, stars, and/or definitions of important words. This process can be practiced on the Model TED Talk transcript as students watch the Avery Bang video during the mini lesson of Work Time A.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.2, 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.7, 6.I.B.8, 6.I.C.11, 6.I.C.12, 6.II.B.5, 6.II.C.6, and 6.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- Ensure that students are distinguishing between interesting information and relevant information that answers the specific questions on the Design Solution: Research note-catcher.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will expand their research to gather information from other sources besides their TED Talk.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Based on the common errors identified in the previous lesson, identify other mini lessons on the research process that may need to be facilitated. This may be whole group or a small group depending on the need.

- Watch the TED Talk: Avery Bang: “Building Bridges and Connecting Communities” and review the information on the Model Design Solution: “Bridges to Prosperity” note-catcher to become familiar with the topic in preparation for modeling how knowledgeable students should be about their own topics.

- Load the TED Talk: Avery Bang: “Building Bridges and Connecting Communities.” Note that this particular talk is part of the TED Archives and is only available via *YouTube*, not TED.com. If *YouTube* is unavailable in the classroom, students can use the transcript.

- Gather devices on which students can conduct research (computers or tablets). Ensure the devices work, are charged, and can access the internet. If devices are unavailable, print the transcripts for each of the TED Talks from TED.com.

- Review the student tasks and example answers to get familiar with what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Prepare copies of handouts for students, including the entrance ticket (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time A: Load the TED Talk: Avery Bang: “Building Bridges and Connecting Communities.” Note that this particular talk is part of the TED Archives and is only available via *YouTube*, not TED.com.

- Work Time B: Provide computers or tablets for each student to continue the research process.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.6.10 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 7**. Students will also need to be able to view the **Work to Contribute to a Better World anchor chart**.

- Explain that we will be adding a new habit of character to this anchor chart. Remind students, as it says at the top of the anchor chart, that they can use their learning to improve their communities.

- Read aloud the new habit of character recorded:

“I take care of and improve our shared spaces.”

- Invite students to Turn and Talk to their partner:

“Using the anchor chart as a guide, what does this mean in your own words?” (Putting things away in the right place when I have finished with them; being careful not to break things that don’t belong to me; cleaning up after myself; putting things back in the right place after moving them around; recycling; throwing litter in the trash.)

- As students share out, capture their responses in the appropriate column on the Work to Contribute to a Better World anchor chart. Refer to **Work to Contribute to a Better World anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Ask:

“How can we apply this habit of character as we work with our devices?” (Being gentle with the computer to ensure they don’t break; going only to approved websites online; not changing any of the settings on the computer; logging out at the end of the session; ensuring that all tablets are plugged in and placed in the right spot on the computer cart.)

- Direct students to keep this habit of character in mind as they continue their research today.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Mini Lesson: Skim and Scan for Evidence – W.6.8 (10 minutes)

- Ask students to retrieve their **Design Solution: Research note-catcher** and focus on Part I: Research Details. Remind students that in the previous lesson, they filled in section A. General Overview.

- Draw students’ attention to sections B. Critical Problem and C. Design Solution under Part I: Research Details. Allow one minute for students to read the specific questions under these two sections.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“How are sections B and C different than section A?” (Section A was more general; sections B and C are looking for specific details that align with the design process.)

- Display the **Design Process graphic**. Distribute **colored pencils or markers** in the colors displayed on the graphic. Invite students to color in the rows on the note-catcher that correspond to the same stage of the infographic and with the same color. For example: Students would notice that the first step on the graphic, ASK, is red, then shade the row on the note-catcher labeled “Design Process, ASK: Identify and research the problem” red.

- Display and direct students’ attention to the **Model Design Solution: “Bridges to Prosperity” note-catcher**. Point out that for each question, there is information from multiple sources. Remind students that effective researchers confirm and enhance their understanding of a topic by consulting multiple sources. Add this note to the **Researchers Do These Things anchor chart**.

- Explain that, for today’s lesson, students need only add information from the TED Talk but should label their notes as Source 1 to distinguish them from sources found in subsequent lessons.

- Refer back to the Model Design Solution: “Bridges to Prosperity” note-catcher. Point out that each question is answered with a few bulleted notes; not all of the information from the TED Talk is listed on the note-catcher.

- Ask:

“Based on this observation, what else should be add to our Researchers Do These Things anchor chart?” (Researchers take notes only on the details that relate specifically to their research question.)

- Use student responses to add to the Researchers Do These Things anchor chart.

- Explain that the TED Talks will be filled with interesting information and important information. Students will need to distinguish the information that is interesting but not relevant to the research question from the information that is.

- Model this process by first distributing the **Model TED Talk Transcript**, which is a transcript of the first 3 or so minutes of the Avery Bang: “Building Bridges and Connecting Communities” TED Talk.

- Explain to students that Avery Bang, who gave this presentation, founded an organization who work with local communities to build footbridges in rural communities to connect residents to education, health care, and opportunities to earn money. Emphasize that the organization work collaboratively with the community to solve the problem.

- Then, display the video TED Talk: Avery Bang: “Building Bridges and Connecting Communities” (https://youtu.be/6Sr0qQlK2g4). Tell students that they are going to watch the video to confirm that they have selected the most relevant information for their note-catchers. Start at the beginning and pause at the 3:16 mark.

- Using a total participation technique, such as **equity sticks**, call on students to share examples of each type of information from this video excerpt. (Answers will vary. Sample student responses may include the following: Avery Bang grew up listening to her dad and uncles talk about engineering—irrelevant. Halfway through college, Avery went on a journey to the South Pacific to find the thing that made her “tick”—irrelevant. Some people have to risk their lives to get to school, work, or medicine—relevant. Isolation is a root cause of poverty—relevant.) Invite students to confirm whether skimming and scanning first helped them isolate the most important pieces of information and encourage them to reflect on how skimming and scanning for evidence can be a useful research technique.

- Note: If *YouTube* is unavailable in the classroom, invite students to share relevant information after they skim and scan the transcript, and encourage them to watch the video on their own later.

- Add “skimming and scanning for evidence” to the Researchers Do These Things anchor chart. Refer to the **Researchers Do These Things anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Explain that students should follow this same pattern of skimming and scanning for evidence as they review the transcript of their chosen TED Talk, and then rewatch it during today’s lesson, before filling in sections B and C on their Design Solution: Research note-catcher.

- Remind students how to access the transcript of the TED Talk to make this process easier and to ensure they record accurate details.

For Lighter Support

- As an extension to the mini lesson of Work Time A, develop a supplemental activity using the transcript of Avery Bang’s TED Talk. This activity could focus on variation in sentence patterns (L.6.3a), which Avery uses to great effect. Invite students to locate the longest and shortest sentences of the transcript. Challenge them to note the function of different sentence patterns. They are likely to notice that the structures of the shortest sentences are often repeated for dramatic effect, and that the longest sentences contain multiple clauses to introduce or elaborate on an important idea.

For Heavier Support

- Before the mini lesson of Work Time A, invite students who need heavier support to complete other timed word-recognition exercises to improve their decoding speed. All activities should be timed to emphasize that the focus is not on comprehension. The ability to quickly decode words in English is a critical reading skill; when students exhaust too much cognitive energy decoding words, they have fewer mental resources for higher-order reading abilities like main-idea comprehension. An example of a simple word-recognition activity is inviting students to scan a newspaper page and quickly mark all words that begin with the letter “a.”

Work Time

B. Research: Gather Evidence – W.6.7, W.6.8 (20 minutes)

- Ensure each student has a **device** connected to the internet and is able to access TED.com. Release students to rewatch their chosen TED Talk and fill in sections B and C on their Design Solution: Research note-catcher.

- With one minute remaining, ask students to pause their research and put away their devices.

- Three minutes before the end of the time, ask students to pause their research and put away their devices. Then refocus the group and invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

- If productive, cue students to practice metacognition and think about their own thinking:

“What strategies helped you succeed today? I’ll give you time to think and discuss with a partner.”

Closing and Assessment

A. Small Group Discussion – RI.6.7 (10 minutes)

- Write the following discussion prompt in an area that is clearly visible to the class, and read it aloud:

“How does William’s design process compare to that of the innovator you chose? What is similar and what is different about their design processes?”

- Invite students to retrieve their **dance cards**. Name a dance partner group for students to join.

- Reminding students of the **Discussion Norms anchor chart**, invite students to begin discussing the prompt using information from today’s research. Circulate and monitor, prompting students to share specific details of their research so that their peers learn about the innovator while also hearing the answer to the prompt.

- Refocus the class. Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
