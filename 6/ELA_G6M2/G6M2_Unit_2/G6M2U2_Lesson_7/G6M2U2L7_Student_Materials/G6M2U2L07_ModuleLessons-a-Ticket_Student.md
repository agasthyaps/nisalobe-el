**Directions:** As you enter class, read the learning targets. Next, read the habit of character already listed on the Work to Contribute to a Better World anchor chart: I use my strengths to help others grow.

Describe a time when you used your strengths to help others grow. Remember that the “communities” named on the anchor chart can refer to any of the groups with which you are associated (school, home, sports team, musical group, club, place of worship, neighborhood, Scout troop, etc.). Be specific in naming your strength and how others grew, or improved, as a result.
