Imagine if you had to risk your life just to get to the doctor. Or to work. Or the supermarket, for that matter. All just because of a river. And how would you decide to send your daughter to school if she had to cross a river, or something like *this*, in order to get there? My path to becoming an engineer started early. Thanks to hours sitting around the dinner table, listening to my dad and uncles banter about literally changing the world around them, I grew up believing that engineers and builders were heroes. But despite having great role models, to actually make it through the math, the chemistry, and the physics courses, I had to find my own sense of purpose and connection with people.

So halfway through college, I made the wildly questionable decision to buy a one-way plane ticket halfway around the world, in search of that thing that really made me tick. A little spoiler alert for you: I found it. But more importantly, on the journey, I came across an idea that I believe has the power to transform the lives in every corner of the globe. My time in the South Pacific widened my metaphorical viewfinders. There was both far greater wealth and deeper poverty than I had ever experienced. For every all-inclusive beach resort, there were many more subsistence-farming communities, living far beyond the reaches of modern conveniences.

And it was in one of these rural communities where my personal quest for connection was confronted at a collective level. Entire communities also experienced the vastness of alone—all due to the simple lack of connection. I saw how a river could make the difference between kids going to school…or not. Mothers having attended births, or not. And farmers being able to sell their goods at market, or not. And what I didn’t realize at the time, but I’ve now spent the last decade researching and experiencing, is that kind of isolation is actually a root cause of poverty, and that poverty is pervasive. Over one billion people lack year-round safe access due to the lack of transportation infrastructure. So that literally means that one in seven people live in a walking existence and they cannot get to where they need to go.
