Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Work Time A: Students complete the End of Unit 2 Assessment. They make decisions about a hypothetical research project surrounding a familiar topic, the Hippo Roller from the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment. Students draw on and assess the credibility of multiple sources, they identify and write responsible paraphrases of excerpts from the sources, and they provide basic bibliographic information for their sources. (W.6.7, W.6.8)

- In this lesson, the habit of character focus is work to become effective learners. Prompt students’ perseverance by reminding them that assessments are meant to inform instruction. Use assessment data to make choices about what should be retaught and how to adjust the pacing. Encourage students not to be afraid of mistakes; an accurate assessment is crucial for tailoring lessons to students’ needs.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- In the second half of Unit 2, students began researching an innovator who used design thinking to address a critical problem. Students who are done with their assessment early may wish to continue research on their chosen innovator.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lessons, students prepared for this assessment by analyzing a model research note catcher, skimming and scanning for evidence, searching for sources, determining source credibility, and paraphrasing and quoting responsibly. The students apply the learned skills in this assessment using a familiar topic from earlier in the unit, the Hippo Roller.

Support All Students

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment.

- Some students may require more than the time allotted to complete the assessment.

- To support ELLs, this lesson invites students to complete assessment tasks similar to the classroom tasks in Lessons 5–10. Students are reintroduced to an invention that they read about in Lessons 4 and 5: the “Hippo Roller.” Asked to simulate a research project to explore the Hippo Roller in more detail, students evaluate the usefulness and credibility of sample search results and identify their content sources, as well as responsibly paraphrase and cite a sample source.

- ELLs may find it challenging to independently complete the end of unit assessment without scaffolding. Point out that the tasks of the assessment are similar to those that students have successfully completed in class. Encourage students to do their best, and assure them that they will continue learning together after the assessment.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.7, 6.I.B.8, 6.I.C.11, 6.I.C.12, 6.II.B.5, 6.II.C.6, and 6.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- Assessment materials (student copy and answer key) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback on this assessment, use the answer key and sample student responses (see Assessment Overview and Resources) to help complete students’ Track Progress recording form.

- Using information from this assessment, students are tracking their long-term progress toward these anchor standards:

- W.7: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Conduct short as well as more sustained research projects based on focused questions, demonstrating understanding of the subject under investigation.

- W.8: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Gather relevant information from multiple print and digital sources, assess the credibility and accuracy of each source, and integrate the information while avoiding plagiarism.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will analyze a problem-solution essay in preparation for collaborative essay writing in Unit 3 and independent essay writing for the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Provide written feedback on each student’s Mid-Unit 2 Assessment.

- Prepare the End of Unit 2 Assessment (see Assessment Overview and Resources).

- Gather Track Progress folders.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time A: Students may complete their assessment

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Return Mid-Unit 2 Assessments (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 11**. Students will also need their **Mid-Unit 2 Assessment with feedback**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. End of Unit 2 Assessment: Research Process – W.6.7, W.6.8 (30 minutes)

- Distribute **End of Unit 2 Assessment: Research Process**.

- Tell students that for this assessment, they will identify the most relevant search results, determine the credibility of sources, paraphrase responsibly, and provide basic bibliography information for sources.

- Invite students to follow along, reading silently in their heads, while the directions for each part of the assessment are read aloud. Make sure students understand the assessment directions; paraphrase some instructions, if needed. ▲ Answer students’ questions, but refrain from supplying answers to the assessment questions themselves.

- Direct students’ attention to the following anchor charts:

- **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart**

- **Strategies to Answer Selected Response Questions anchor chart**

- Remind students to refer to these anchor charts as they read the assessment text and answer the assessment questions.

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence. Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart** and review what perseverance looks and sounds like. Remind students that because they will be reading and answering questions independently for the assessment, they may need to practice perseverance.

- Invite students to begin the assessment.

- While they are taking the assessment, circulate to monitor and document their test-taking skills.

- Give students specific, positive feedback on their completion of the End of Unit 2 Assessment. Refer to **End of Unit 2 Assessment: Research Process (answers for teacher reference)** to assess.

For Lighter Support

- Before the assessment of Work Time A, underline key vocabulary in the assessment directions and prompt and read aloud together as a class to ensure that students understand each task included in the assessment. Invite students who need lighter support to restate or clarify information for students who need heavier support.

For Heavier Support

- Display a “map” of the assessment to reference while explaining directions to the end of unit assessment. This will reduce ambiguity and give students a clearer picture of what they can expect so that they can better allocate their time and attentional resources. Provide students with colored pencils or highlighters so that they can mark up the “map” as needed. Example:

- Determine the effectiveness of search terms and the usefulness of search results related to the Hippo Roller.

- Determine the content sources and credibility of search results.

- Determine which answer responsibly paraphrases an excerpt from “The Hippo Roller.”

- Write a paraphrase of another excerpt from “The Hippo Roller.”

- Copy bibliographic information from an online source.

Closing and Assessment

A. Track Progress – W.6.7, W.6.8 (10 minutes)

- Distribute **Track Progress folders**, **Track Progress: Research**, and **sticky notes**.

- Guide students through completing the recording form.

- Instruct students to leave row 1 and row 3 blank because those standards do not apply to this assessment.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread chapter 15 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* in preparation for studying the chapter in the next lesson.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
