End of Unit 2 Assessment: Research Process

(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Important note:** As process standards, these standards are more fully, authentically, and meaningfully assessed when students are engaged in their actual research that occurs in this unit. The items included on this assessment address these standards in only a perfunctory way due to the nature and limitations of an on-demand assessment. More accurate and nuanced evidence of student achievement toward these standards can be gathered from their research note-catcher completed during Unit 2 (W.6.7, W.6.8) and their problem-solution essay written from their research during Unit 3 (W.6.8). Using this assessment in conjunction with those other artifacts will afford a richer picture of student performance toward these research standards.

**Directions:** Use your understanding of the research process that you have been building throughout Unit 2 to complete the following items.

1.  **Part A**

You read about the Hippo Roller in the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment. Imagine you were researching that invention for our critical problem-design solution research project. The results of four of your searches are shown below. Select the two search results that show sources that will likely be the most useful in completing that research project. (W.6.7)

<u>B and C</u>

**Part B**

How would you describe the **search results** and their effect on the research for your answers in Part A? (W.6.7)

The search results in B and C are more varied, specific, and complex rather than general, which means each result might add to our understanding not just repeat the same information.

2.  **Part A**

The table below lists some search results for a Google search of “Hippo Roller.” Match each content source descriptor with its search result by writing the appropriate letter in the last column. (W.6.8)

**Part B**

What is something important to keep in mind if you were going to use source 2, Hippo Roller’s product website? (W.6.8)

While it seems likely that the information on this website is accurate, they might not include information that is negative or critical. As a result, it’d be important to use other sources as well to ensure we have the full story.

**Part C**

Select the **three** sources above that are likely the **most** credible of the search results. For each of your three selections, write the source number and a sentence to explain your reasoning. (W.6.8)

1 – This is a newspaper publication. For this reason, it is a likely credible and reliable source.

3 – This is an article from a Harvard University publication. Harvard is a respected institution, which means anything published under its name is likely to be credible and reliable.

6 – This is a website about a National Park in Africa. Because it is a government agency, it is likely to be credible and reliable.

**Part D**

Select the **three** sources above that are likely to be the **least** credible of the search results. For each of your three selections, write the source number and a sentence to explain your reasoning. (W.6.8)

4 – This is an anonymous Reddit post. We have no idea who the person is or what their knowledge or expertise is or from where they are getting their information.

5 – This is a Prezi made by someone named Yoland Munoz. We have no idea who the person is or what their knowledge or expertise is or from where they are getting their information.

7 – This is an anonymous blog post. We have no idea who the person is or what their knowledge or expertise is or from where they are getting their information.

3.  **Part A**

Read the excerpt from “The Hippo Roller” below:

With the Hippo Roller, women and children are collecting more than just water, they are collecting time. In the time they used to spend fetching water, children are attending school and women are being trained in skills they can use to start a business and earn income.

Which of the following best represents a responsible paraphrase of the excerpt? (W.6.8)

4.  With the Hippo Roller, women and children are collecting more than just water, they are collecting time. In the time they used to spend fetching water, children are attending school and women are being trained in skills they can use to start a business and earn income (“The Hippo Roller”).

5.  Because of the Hippo Roller, women and kids are getting more than just water, they are getting time. Children are going to school and women are getting skills they can use to earn income (“The Hippo Roller”).

6.  <u>The Hippo Roller is doing more than making water easier to carry. It’s giving time back to the children and the women so they can focus on their lives and future (“The Hippo Roller”).</u>

7.  “With the Hippo Roller, women and children are collecting more than just water, they are collecting time. In the time they used to spend fetching water, children are attending school and women are being trained in skills they can use to start a business and earn income” (“The Hippo Roller”).

**Part B**

Which of the following best describes the answer to Part A?

1.  It uses the exact same language and structure as the original excerpt.

<!-- -->

8.  <u>It summarizes the content while rewording, removing, and rearranging the language and structure of the original excerpt.</u>

9.  It uses the exact same language and structure as the original excerpt inside quotation marks.

10. It changes some of the words from the original excerpt and uses the same structure, but doesn’t include all of the original information.

11. Write a responsible paraphrase of this excerpt from “The Hippo Roller” (W.6.8):

Millions of women and children walk up to 6 hours every day to collect water with heavy  
5-gallon buckets balanced on their heads. This causes long-term neck and spine damage.

Answers will vary. Every day women and children must endure physical hardship and injury just to have the water they need to survive (“The Hippo Roller”).
