QuickWrite: Understand Connotation

RI.6.4, W.6.10, L.6.5c

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Read the following sentence from chapter 11 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* and the definition of the word **gazed**. Then, write your answer to the question.

“Within minutes, a dozen people gathered at the base and **gazed** up at the machine” (198).

**gazed** (noun, past tense): looked at something for a long time without looking away, usually with respect, admiration, or surprise

What other words, with a similar meaning, could the authors have used instead of **gazed**? How would the meaning of the sentence have changed if they used those alternatives?

Sample response: The authors could have worked words like *looked* or *stared* instead of *gazed*. All of these words mean to lay your eyes on something. However, *gaze* gives more information than *look*. *Gaze* means to look at something for a long time and feeling emotional while you look. *Look* could mean to just lay your eyes on something for a second and without any other reaction.
