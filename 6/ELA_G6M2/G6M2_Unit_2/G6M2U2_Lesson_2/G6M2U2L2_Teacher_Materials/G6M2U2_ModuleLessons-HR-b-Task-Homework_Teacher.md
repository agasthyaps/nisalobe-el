9.  Write an effective summary of chapter 11 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*. (RI.6.2)

Chapter 11 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* chronicles William’s assembly of the windmill and the illumination of William’s bedroom. A central idea of this chapter is that William’s hard work and resourceful nature lead to a fully functioning windmill that produces electricity. William lacks modern tools; therefore, he uses accessible materials to build the windmill. He spends three hours in the repetitive process of heating a nail to poke holes in the plastic blades of the windmill. After realizing that he cannot properly fasten the windmill blades, William collects bottle caps then hammers them out to serve as washers. He uses everyday materials to construct the windmill. William, Geoffrey, and Gilbert build the windmill tower and hoist the windmill into place. With a crowd of onlookers, William connects a lightbulb and the windmill produces the electricity William has been working to achieve.
