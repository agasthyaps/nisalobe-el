**Sentence**

Then it came: a flicker, a flash, **then a burst of bright, magnificent light**. (from page 200 of  
*The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* by William Kamkwamba and Bryan Mealer)

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the Daily Learning Target **(I can determine meanings of words and phrases as they are used in the text)** and RI.6.4, L.6.3a, and L.6.5 by featuring several similar words with nuances in meaning and by facilitating opportunities to manipulate sentence structure. Supporting Standards: RI.6.1, RI.6.5, SL.6.1

- Big idea: The sentence helps students respond to the big idea that **effective learners demonstrate perseverance when they research, build prototypes, reflect, and revise** by highlighting William’s moment of triumph and success after multiple attempts and revisions to his plan.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it requires interpretation of words with only slight differences in meaning and uses an adverb (**then**) to organize ideas within a sentence. Invite students to discuss each chunk briefly, but encourage extended conversation and practice with the focus structure: **then a burst of bright, magnificent light**.

- Practice and Transfer: After discussing the focus structure, students practice using it to discuss something in their lives. Students transfer their understanding of the meaning and structure of this sentence when interpreting text structure throughout Unit 2.

“How could we rewrite this sentence as multiple sentences?

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the big idea that effective learners demonstrate perseverance when they research, build prototypes, reflect, and revise?” Responses will vary, but look for students to notice that this sentence shows the end result of many failed attempts and reroutes.)

- If productive, cue students to provide reasoning or evidence for their answers.

“Why do you think that?”

Practice

- Display the following sentences:

**William drove bolts through the washers.**

**William attached a dynamo to the bike frame.**

**William built a tall wooden tower for the windmill.**

- Say:

“These sentences all describe things that William has done. Try to combine them into a single sentence. Add other words as needed to help you organize the ideas.”

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners. After one minute, invite students to share their answers with the class.

- Remind students that posting the chunks in language categories will help them use the language again for future speaking and writing tasks.

- Say and call on volunteers:

“Now take each chunk and post it to the appropriate Language Chunk Wall. You can refer to these chunks again as you speak and write.”
