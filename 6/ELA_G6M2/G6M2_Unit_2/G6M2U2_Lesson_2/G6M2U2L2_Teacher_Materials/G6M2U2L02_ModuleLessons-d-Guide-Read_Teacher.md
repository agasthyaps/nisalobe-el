Close Reading Guide: *The Boy Who Harnessed  
the Wind*, Pages 196–201

RI.6.1, RI.6.2, RI.6.3

(For Teacher Reference)

**Purpose and Notes**

- The purpose of this close read is for students to analyze the portion of the text for its central idea and how that central idea is conveyed through particular key details. Students will analyze the key event of the text and how it supports the central idea. In addition, they will explore how this portion of the text relates to the text as a whole. (R.6.3)

- The following standards are incidental—no direct instruction in this close read, but practice of these standards occurs as a result of addressing the focus standards: L.6.4, L.6.5.

- In this close read, students will focus only on pages 196–201 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*.

- For the sake of time, the students have preread pages 196–201 as the previous lesson’s homework. During this lesson, the teacher provides a second reading of pages 196–201 as a read aloud in class.

- As the teacher rereads these pages aloud, students read silently. From time to time, the teacher will have students reread portions of the text in order to answer text dependent questions.

- Students work in pairs for this close read.

- A note-catcher along with text-dependent questions provide an opportunity for students to respond to the text-dependent questions.

- Continue to use discussion protocols (e.g., Turn and Talk, Cold Call, and total participation techniques) to engage all students in collaborative discussion about the text.

<li><p>Distribute the Close Read note-catcher.</p></li>
<li><p>Explain that we’re about to reread and zero in on an important section in the book.</p></li>
<li><p>Cold-call on students to quickly establish the gist of this section, that William is trying out his windmill.</p></li>
<li><p>First, remind students what they know about William’s experience up to this point in the text.</p></li>
<li><p>Using a total participation technique, ask: “We read a lot about the famine in Malawi in the first chapters of this text. We also read about William’s determination to learn even though his family is too poor to pay for him to go to school. How have those two experiences contributed to this moment where he is today?” (The famine made him determined to find a way to pump water so there would be no more drought and famine. His determination to learn made him find a way to teach himself even though he couldn’t go to school. Today, his self-made windmill is ready to test.)</p></li>

<li><p>Direct students to the sentence, “I didn’t have any rope, so I had to borrow my mother’s wire clothesline instead.”</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “Why do you think this sentence is included?” (It reminds us of how few resources William had to build his windmill, and how he constantly found ways to successfully improvise.)</p></li>

<li><p>Read the text aloud as students follow along, reading silently.</p></li>
<li><p>Direct students, working in partners, to discuss, and then record in their note-catchers, their responses to this question: “What is actually happening in this section of text?” (William and his friends are raising the windmill frame to the top of the tower.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “Suppose the writer had written instead of this section, ‘We raised the windmill to the top of the tower.’ What understanding of the whole story would we have missed that way?” (We would not have seen what a dramatic moment this was, how hard the boys are having to work, and how important this moment is to the entire story, since everything William has tried to do with electricity has led up to this moment of trying out the windmill.)</p></li>

<td><ul>
<li><p>Read the text aloud as students follow along, reading silently.</p></li>
<li><p>Use a total participation technique to ask: “What are the last two sentences on this page telling us? Why are they important?” (William is happy. His windmill is well-built and it will probably work. It’s important because the whole book has been leading up to this moment for him.)</p></li>

<li><p>Read the text aloud as students follow along, reading silently.</p></li>
<li><p>Direct students, working in partners, to discuss and then record in their note-catchers responses to this question:</p></li>
<li><p>“What do we learn from the conversation with Kalino?” (Kalino thinks the windmill is silly and that creating electricity from the wind is impossible.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “We’ve never heard about Kalino before. Why might the author be including this conversation with him here?” (He wants us to see how skeptical the village people are about his efforts to build a windmill.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “What do we know about opportunities for education and science in his village?” (Many people do not go to school because they can’t afford it. In their world, things largely happen because of magic, not science. They are ignorant about any form of engineering.)</p></li>
<li><p>Cold-call on pairs to share their thinking. If prompting is needed, remind students about William’s own experience with not being able to go to school, and about the “magical world” he described in the early chapters of the book.</p></li>

<li><p>Read the text aloud as students follow along, reading silently.</p></li>
<li><p>Direct students’ attention to the note-catcher and invite them to Think-Pair-Share in response to these questions.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “If you were drawing this scene, what would you show?” (People standing around watching, William climbing to the top of the tower.)</p></li>
<li><p>Follow up by asking: “What kinds of thought bubbles would you draw for the villagers? What in the text would make you do that?” (People wondering what he’s doing, people calling him crazy. Evidence from text shows this.)</p></li>
<li><p>Follow up by asking: “What expression would you put on William’s face? What word in the last two sentences helps you know how William is feeling?” (He would be smiling—text says he is “confident.”)</p></li>
<li><p>Cold-call on student pairs to answer. If necessary, explain the word <strong>confident</strong> for students.</p></li>
<li><p>Note: If time permits, have students actually make this drawing.</p></li>

<tr class="odd">
<td>Read aloud pages 199–201 starting at “‘Let’s see” and ending at “. . . burn my hand.”</td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Read the text aloud as students follow along, reading silently.</p></li>
<li><p>Have students continue to work in pairs to discuss, then answer the following questions on their note-catcher.</p></li>
<li><p>Point out to students that we are approaching a very big moment for William, when he first tries out his windmill. We will look at how the writer zooms in on this moment.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “Notice that the writer writes, ‘the machine groaned against the breeze, as if begging me to release it.’ This is a technique called ‘personification,’ where a thing is being described as if it were a person. Why do you think the writer may have done this?” (William has worked so hard for so long on his windmill that he is very attached to it. Also, he wants us to see what a big moment this is in his life).</p></li>
<li><p>Direct students to notice the focus on the wind in the paragraph that begins, “Just then a strong gust of wind . . .”</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “What is a <strong>gust of wind</strong>? Why is it helpful for the reader to read that the wind is strong?” (A gust is a sudden extra strong moment, or burst, of wind. The reader needs to remember that the windmill depends on wind, and the wind is here at this very important moment.)</p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Read aloud pages 199–201 starting at “‘Let’s see” and ending at “. . . burn my hand.”</td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Invite a student to read aloud the short paragraph beginning with “Then it came” to “my heart nearly exploded.”</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “Suppose the writer had written instead, ‘The light came on.’ What understanding of this moment would we have missed? What understanding of the whole story would we have missed?” (We would have missed how dramatic this was, and how clear it was that windmill was actually making electricity. This is what William has been trying to accomplish during the whole story.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “What does <strong>my heart nearly exploded</strong> show us about what William is feeling at this point?” (He cares enormously about the success of his windmill.)</p></li>
<li><p>Tell students that they will return to this passage for a Language Dive later in the lesson.</p></li>
<li><p>Direct students to reread with their partners from “Look!” someone shouted” (200) to “I finally came down when the bulb started to burn my hand” (201).</p></li>
<li><p>Have students discuss with their partner, then respond on the note-catcher: “How has the response of the crowd changed here? How do you know? Why is this important to the story?” (People are excited, they say ‘it’s true what he said’, etc. This is important to the story because William has proven to the villagers that windmills can actually make electricity.)</p></li>
<li><p>Point out to students the use of the word <strong>mad</strong> at the bottom of page 200. Cold-call on a student to share the meaning of the word in this context. Make sure that students understand that <strong>mad</strong> here means crazy not angry.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “Now that we have finished looking closely at this important section of the text, what would you say the central idea of this passage is?” (People thought that William was crazy, but after months of work he is thrilled to prove that his windmill can make “electric wind.”)</p></li>
</ul></td>

<tr class="odd">
<td>Culminating Task</td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Direct students to the Culminating Task short response question on the Close Read note-catcher.</p></li>
<li><p>Look at the sentence on page 201 when William says, “‘And now I’m going bigger! Just wait and see!’”</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “Based on what you have read so far in this book, what do you think this statement shows about what William will do now?” (Answers will vary, but may include the following: William will build an even bigger and more sophisticated windmill. William may use the electricity from the windmill to wire his entire house or pump water to the fields.)</p></li>
<li><p>Have students complete their responses independently and collect to check their understanding.</p></li>
