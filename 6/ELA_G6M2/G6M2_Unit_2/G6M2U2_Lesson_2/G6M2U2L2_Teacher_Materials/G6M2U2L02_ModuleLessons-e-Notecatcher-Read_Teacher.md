(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Analyze specific passages from this text excerpt to determine its central idea and how that central idea is conveyed through particular key details. Then, answer the questions during the close read.

1.  Look again at the sentence, “I didn’t have any rope, so I had to borrow my mother’s wire clothesline instead.”

Why do you think this sentence is included?

It reminds us of how few resources William had to build his windmill and how he constantly found ways to successfully improvise.

2.  Reread pages 196–197 aloud starting at “‘Easy now!’” to “little by little it made its way up the tower.”

What is actually happening in this section of text?

William and his friends are raising the windmill frame to the top of the tower.

3.  Reread the rest of page 197.

What are the last two sentences on this page telling us? Why are they important?

William is happy. His windmill is well built, and it will probably work. It’s important because the whole book has been leading up to this moment for him.

4.  Reread page 198 starting at “While Geoffrey made . . .” and ending at “‘just stand back and watch.’”

What do we learn from the conversation with Kalino?

Kalino thinks the windmill is silly and that creating electricity from the wind is impossible.

5.  Reread pages 198–199 starting at “I climbed down” and ending at “I’d prepared for this moment for months.”

**Part B**

Add thought bubbles to the scene from Part A. Show what the villagers are thinking. What in the text makes you think so?

People wondering what he’s doing; people calling him crazy. Evidence from the text shows this.

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

**Part D**

What word in the last two sentences helps you know how William is feeling?

The text says he is “confident.”

6.  Reread pages 199–201 starting at “‘Let’s see” and ending at “. . . burn my hand.”

How has the response of the crowd changed here? How do you know? Why is this important to the story?

People are excited, they say “it’s true what he said,” etc. This is important to the story because William has proven to the villagers that windmills can actually make electricity.

7.  What does “my heart nearly exploded” show us about what William is feeling at this point?

He cares enormously about the success of his windmill.

8.  Culminating Task: Reread the sentence on page 201 where William says, “And now I’m going bigger! Just wait and see!”

Based on what you have read so far in this book, what do you think this statement shows about what William will do now?

Answers will vary. Sample student response: William will build an even bigger and more sophisticated windmill. William may use the electricity from the windmill to wire his entire house or pump water to the fields.
