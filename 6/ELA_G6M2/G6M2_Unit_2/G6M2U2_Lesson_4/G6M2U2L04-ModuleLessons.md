Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Work Time A: Students complete the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment. They read a new informational text called “The Hippo Roller,” and then answer selected response questions about figurative and connotative meanings of words in the text and about the way that key ideas are developed. Students also write an objective summary of the text, identifying its central idea and the details that convey it. (RI.6.1, RI.6.2, RI.6.3, RI.6.4, RI.6.5, RI.6.10, W.6.10, L.6.4a, L.6.5a, L.6.5c)

- Students focus on working to become effective learners by demonstrating perseverance during the mid-unit assessment. Prompt students’ perseverance by reminding them that assessments are meant to inform instruction. Teachers use assessment data to make choices about what should be retaught and how to adjust the pacing. Encourage students not to be afraid of mistakes; an accurate assessment is crucial for tailoring lessons to students’ needs.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- In the second half of Unit 2, students begin researching another innovator who used design thinking to address a critical problem. Students who are done with their assessment early may wish to begin their research using the list of featured innovators on the Critical Problem and Design Solution Research Project handout.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the first half of this unit, students read chapters from *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, interpreting figurative language and connotative meanings of words, identifying text structure, determining central idea(s) and key supporting details of chapters 11–12 of the text, and summarizing what they read. This lesson continues those routines in an assessment, asking students to apply their learning to a new informational text.

Support All Students

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment.

- Some students may feel overwhelmed by the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment, which requires that they read an unfamiliar text and answer questions independently, with fewer supports than they may be accustomed to. Honor students’ anxieties, while also celebrating all that students have learned and accomplished so far. Additionally, remind students that there will be continued opportunities throughout the module to improve skills and demonstrate understanding. ▲

- Some students may need the text read aloud before they work on the questions. Invite students who require this to sit in a group away from the rest of the students, so as not to be distracting. ▲

- For some students, this assessment may require more than the 30 minutes allotted. Consider providing time over multiple days if necessary.

- To support ELLs, this lesson invites students to complete assessment tasks similar to the classroom tasks in Lessons 1–3. Students read a new informational text about a critical problem and its design solution. Then, students answer selected response questions about the text and write an objective summary.

- ELLs may find it challenging to independently complete the mid-unit assessment without scaffolding. Point out that, even though the mid-unit assessment introduces a new informational text, the tasks of the assessment are similar to those that students have successfully completed in class. Encourage students to do their best, and assure them that they will continue learning together after the assessment.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.7, and 6.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- The Mid-Unit 2 Assessment: Analyze Figurative Language and Central Idea: “The Hippo Roller” resources (student and teacher version) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback on this assessment, use the teacher answer key and sample student responses (see Assessment Overview and Resources) to help complete students’ Track Progress recording form.

- Using information from this assessment, students are tracking their long-term progress toward these anchor standards:

- R.1: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.

- R.4: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Interpret words and phrases as they are used in a text, including determining technical, connotative, and figurative meanings, and analyze how specific word choices shape meaning or tone.

- R.10: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Read and comprehend complex literary and informational texts independently and proficiently.

- L.4: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Determine or clarify the meaning of unknown and multiple-meaning words and phrases by using context clues, analyzing meaningful word parts, and consulting general and specialized reference materials, as appropriate.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will begin researching another innovator who used design thinking to address a critical problem. They will be guided through several mini lessons to learn the steps of the research process as the gather the information they will need for the Unit 3 assessments and performance task.

- Students’ Mid-Unit 2 Assessments will be returned in Lesson 11 with feedback.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 4**. Students will also need their **Module 2 End of Unit 1 Assessment with feedback**.

- Once all students are ready, invite them to share their “stars” and “steps” with a partner. Remind students that everyone is working toward individual goals and that learning is about continued growth and development.

- Using a preferred classroom routine, collect or review the answers to **Homework: Analyze Connotation: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, **Chapter 12**. Refer to the **Homework: Analyze Connotation: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, **Chapter 12 (answers for teacher reference)**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as the previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Mid-Unit 2 Assessment: Analyze Figurative Language and Central Idea: “The Hippo Roller” (30 minutes)

- Distribute **Mid-Unit 2 Assessment: Analyze Figurative Language and Central Idea: “The Hippo Roller.”** Read the directions for each part of the assessment aloud as students to follow along, reading silently. Answer clarifying questions.

- Direct students’ attention to the following anchor charts:

- **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart**

- **Strategies to Answer Selected Response Questions anchor chart**

- **Structure anchor chart**

- **Author’s Methods anchor chart**

- Remind students to refer to these anchor charts as they read the assessment text and answer the assessment questions.

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence. Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart** and review what perseverance looks and sounds like. Remind students that because they will be reading and answering questions independently for the assessment, they may need to practice perseverance.

- Invite students to begin the assessment.

- While they are taking the assessment, circulate to monitor and document their test-taking skills.

- Give students specific, positive feedback on their completion of the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment.

For Lighter Support

- Before the assessment of Work Time A, underline key vocabulary in the assessment directions and prompt and read aloud together as a class to ensure that students understand each task included in the assessment. Invite students who need lighter support to restate or clarify information for students who need heavier support.

For Heavier Support

- Display a “map” of the assessment to reference while explaining directions to the mid-unit assessment. This will reduce ambiguity and give students a clearer picture of what they can expect so that they can better allocate their time and attentional resources. Provide students with colored pencils or highlighters so that they can mark up the “map” as needed. Example:

- Read “The Hippo Roller” text. Then,

- Locate a word in a paragraph that helps you understand *another* word.

- Determine the connotation of a word.

- Determine the way this connotation helps us understand the text.

- Identify a sentence that shows the central idea of the text.

- Identify types of figurative language and explain how figurative language helps develop a key idea in the text.

- Identify the structure of the text and explain how the structure helps develop a central idea of the text.

- Identify a method that the author uses to develop the reader’s understanding and explain how the method helps develop the central idea of the text.

- Write an objective summary.

Closing and Assessment

A. Track Progress – RI.6.1 (10 minutes)

- Give students specific, positive feedback on their completion of the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment.

- Distribute **Track Progress folders**, **Track Progress: Read, Understand, and Explain New Text**, **Writing Record**, and **sticky notes**.

- Guide students through completing the recording form. Tell students the sticky notes are for them to find evidence of the following criteria:

- RI.6.1

- RI.6.4, L.6.4

- Direct students to fill in the next row of the Writing Record about the summary they just wrote for the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Vary Sentence Patterns

- Students complete **Homework: Vary Sentence Patterns** to practice varying sentences to create more interesting or logical text.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
