<td><p><strong>Why Is Bicycle Safety So Important?</strong></p>
<p>Riding a bicycle is great fun and an excellent form of exercise. But it is also the cause of many accidents. Every year, about 300,000 kids end up in the hospital due to bike injuries. Head injuries from falling off a bike can cause brain damage, even death. Many of these head injuries can be prevented if the rider wears a bike helmet. A 2003 survey found that only 48% of kids ages 5 to 14 wore a bike helmet when riding. Older kids were even less likely to wear a helmet. Wearing a helmet should be part of your routine every time you get on a bike.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the Proper Way to Wear a Helmet?</strong></p>
<p>Wearing a bike helmet properly is essential for getting the most protection. Choose a helmet that is neither too big nor too small. Do not wear a hat underneath your helmet. Find an online guide or video to ensure you are picking a helmet with the right fit. The straps should always be fastened. Check that the side straps form a “V” just under your ears. With the latch on the straps secured, tighten the straps so that one finger can just fit between your chin and the strap. With your mouth wide open, you should be able to feel the helmet pressing on the top of your head.</p></td>
