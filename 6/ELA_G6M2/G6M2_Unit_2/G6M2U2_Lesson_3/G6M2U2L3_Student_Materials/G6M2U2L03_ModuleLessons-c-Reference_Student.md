Synopsis: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, Chapter 12

**Name:** **Date:**

- William has not yet found a battery, so on calm nights with no wind, the Kamkwamba household is without lights. William and his family rely on the old kerosene lamps.

- William’s cousin, Ruth, presents William with a challenge: charging her cell phone with his windmill.

- William knows that the windmill must produce more voltage in order to charge a phone, so William creates his own step-up transformer to boost the power.

- William finally gets a car battery from his cousin, Charity. He wires the house for electricity and creates light switches as well.

- After a big storm, William’s roof collapses in his room. William notices that his wiring crossed and could have started a fire. William decides to search for a solution to his poor wiring.

- William consults *Explaining Physics* and learns about circuit breakers. Another big storm hits the Kamkwamba household. William’s roof collapses again. William sees that his circuit breaker works and a fire was avoided.

- The bike chain on the windmill keeps breaking. William needs a permanent solution. He gets the idea of a pulley and belt system from Geoffrey. William is able to find pulleys in the scrapyard and gets a belt from one of the maize milling machines at the mill where Geoffrey works.

- The pulleys and belt work. William no longer has to constantly repair the bike chain on the windmill.
