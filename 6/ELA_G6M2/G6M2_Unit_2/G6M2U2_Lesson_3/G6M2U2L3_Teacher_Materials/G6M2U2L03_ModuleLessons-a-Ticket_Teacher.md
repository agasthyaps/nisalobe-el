**Directions:** As you enter class, read the learning targets. Next, read the following sentence from chapter 12 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*. Then, answer the questions.

“‘You are my own creation!’ I shouted to my windmill. ‘So why are you trying to destroy me? Please, let me help you’” (222).

1.  What type of figurative language is used in this sentence?

2.  metaphor

3.  hyperbole

4.  simile

5.  <u>personification</u>

6.  How does this use of figurative language help to develop a key idea in *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*?

7.  The author’s use of figurative language makes the text interesting but does not help to develop a central idea.

8.  <u>The author’s use of figurative language illustrates how personally connected William feels to his windmill.</u>

9.  The author’s use of figurative language helps describe how complicated science and energy are.

10. The author’s use of figurative language shows that William does not have very many friends.

11. I chose my answer because

One of the central ideas we have identified is how personally meaningful this project was to William. He was creating the windmill not just as a hobby but to bring necessary electricity, light, and irrigation to his family home and farm. Talking out loud to his windmill as if it were a real person reflects this central idea.
