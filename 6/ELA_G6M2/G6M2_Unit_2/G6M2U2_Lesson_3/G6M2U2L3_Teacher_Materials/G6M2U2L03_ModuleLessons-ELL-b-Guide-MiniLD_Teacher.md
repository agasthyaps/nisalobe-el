5-Minute Mini Language Dive

RI.6.4, SL.6.1, L.6.5

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

**When news of this invention reached the trading center,** the line of people wanting to charge their phones reached the road. (from page 211 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* by William Kamkwamba and Bryan Mealer)

**Lesson 3 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after students read chapter 12 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* in Work Time A.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address RI.6.4 and L.6.5 by highlighting the impact of William’s inventions on his community and by facilitating opportunities to interpret words with multiple meanings.

- The sentence helps students to address the Guiding Question “What habits of character can help solve a critical problem to contribute to a better community?”

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses the same word more than once with nuances in meaning (**reached**), it uses a conjunction to situate an event in time, and it illustrates the growing popularity of William’s work.

- Transfer: **When** + independent clause, independent clause = to organize events in summaries of texts with both chronological and cause and effect text structures throughout Unit 2. Invite students to revisit and use the frame of the Practice section when they complete Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 6. This entrance ticket prompts students to explore the habits of character that William demonstrates, using evidence from the text.

**Deconstruct**

- **<u>When news of this invention reached the trading center,</u> the line of people wanting to charge their phones reached the road.**

- Say:

“What does this sentence mean to you?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Draw student attention to the word **reached.**

- Say:

“How many times do you see the word reached in this sentence?” (Twice.)

“Can you show me what it means to reach your arms toward the walls of the classroom?” (Look for students to understand that to reach often means to extend toward.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **When news of this invention reached the trading center,**

- Say:

“What do you notice about this chunk?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“What does it mean that news reached the trading center?” (People at the trading center heard the news; the news made it to the trading center.)

“In this chapter, what news reached the trading center?” (News that William invented a  
“step-up” transformer that could charge people’s phones.)

“Can this chunk stand on its own as a complete sentence? How do you know?” (No; it uses the phrase when, which introduces a dependent clause.)

**Reconstruct**

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **<u>When news of this invention reached the trading center,</u> the line of people wanting to charge their phones reached the road.**

- Draw student attention to the second clause in the sentence: **the line of people wanting to charge their phones reached the road.**

“Why did the line of people reach the road?” (Because people were excited; because people wanted to charge their phones using William’s invention.)

“What does this tell us about what William’s inventions mean to his community?” (Even though people sometimes tease William, they are excited and energized by his work.)

- If time allows, say:

“Look at the two uses of the word reached in this sentence. How are these uses similar? How are they different?” (Responses will vary, but guide students to understand that news reaching a trading center and a line reaching the road represents a more figurative use of the word.)

- If it is useful to do so based on students’ needs, draw attention to the conjunction **when** at the beginning of the sentence. Say:

“Why did the authors use the word when?” (To show an order of events; to organize events by time; to explain when something happened.)

“How can we use when in our speaking or writing?” (Responses will vary.)

“Think about the text structures we have been studying. What structures might feature the word when used in this way?” (Chronological; cause and effect.)

- Say:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question: What habits of character can help solve a critical problem to contribute to a better community?” (Responses will vary.)

**Practice**

- Display the following sentence frame:

> **When the journalists reached William’s windmill, they \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**
>
> independent clause
>
> (**When** + independent clause, independent clause)

- Say:

“Use this frame to talk about what the journalists did when they visited William’s windmill. Think about how this might connect to habits of character. Use your own words and work with your partners.”

- Answers will vary. Sample response:

> **When the journalists reached William’s windmill, they <u>asked lots of questions and admired his work.</u>**
