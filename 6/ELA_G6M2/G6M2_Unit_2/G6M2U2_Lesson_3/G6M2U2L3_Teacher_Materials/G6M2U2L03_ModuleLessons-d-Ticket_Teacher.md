**Directions:** Read the following excerpt from chapter 12 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*. Then, answer questions about the connotation of the word **gang**.

“The broken beam had also dumped hundreds of squirming termites onto the floor and across my bed. At first I tried sweeping them off, but there were too many. My father had managed to buy a few more chickens, and as I looked out my open door, I saw a **gang** of them walking past” (217).

1.  Which synonym of the word **gang** best matches how it is used in the sentence?

2.  team

3.  <u>group</u>

4.  club

5.  organization

6.  What phrase in the excerpt helps in understanding the meaning of **gang**?

7.  “squirming termites”

8.  “sweeping them off”

9.  <u>“a few more chickens”</u>

10. “open door”

11. Carefully read these two sentences:

“My father had managed to buy a few more chickens, and as I looked out my open door, I saw a **gang** of them walking past.”

My father had managed to buy a few more chickens, and as I looked out my open door, I saw a **group** of them walking past.

The words in bold have very similar meanings. Given the context of the chapter, what does the connotation of the word **gang** add to the reader’s understanding of the text?

The word *gang* often has a negative connotation. It suggests that the chickens have organized themselves to complete a villainous task. In this case, the task is eating the termites. While this is helpful to William, the termites would not view this gang of chickens favorably.
