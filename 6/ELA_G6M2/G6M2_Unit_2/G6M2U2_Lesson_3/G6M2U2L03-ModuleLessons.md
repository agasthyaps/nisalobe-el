Opportunities to Extend Learning

- National Geographic has developed a number of games to understand circuits, energy, and electricity. These games involve purposeful movement and social interaction. By creating a “human circuit,” students can better understand the complicated science discussed in this chapter.

- An optional Mini Language Dive, intended for use after students complete chapter 12 in Work Time A, is available in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- In this lesson students analyze connotations. To extend learning, in Work Time B and Closing and Assessment A, invite students to identify the connotations of other words in this chapter.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students engaged in a close read and a Language Dive of strategically chosen excerpts of chapter 11 in the anchor text, during which they analyzed the author’s use of structure and key details to convey a central idea.

- In this lesson, students continue their analysis of author’s craft by distinguishing how words of different connotation affect the meaning of the sentence in which they’re used.

Support All Students

- Note that there is a differentiated version of the exit ticket used in Closing and Assessment A in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Chapter 12 contains additional descriptions of the scientific processes William used to build his windmill. On page 210, for example, a detailed paragraph describes the process of mutual induction. These passages may be challenging for any student, especially ELLs, who may feel overwhelmed by the complexity of these passages. Consider ways to scaffold students’ understanding: providing images, graphs, or short summaries, or having students work with partners to create visual depictions of the processes described. ▲

- Not all students may be as fascinated by electricity and physics as William is in the book. Find places to emphasize just how extraordinary William’s achievement was. Hype up the near impossibility of what he attempted to accomplish. Challenge students to go a day without electricity (or imagine the scenario); generate a list of all the ways not having electricity would impact their daily lives.

- To support ELLs, this lesson continues to prepare students for the mid-unit assessment of the following lesson by helping them interpret the connotations of words selected by the authors. Scaffolds are gradually released across the lesson: First, students are led through a guided example, in which they explore the connotative implications of the authors’ use of the word *headaches* as an alternative to *problems*. Then, during Closing and Assessment A, students independently apply this learning to a related example, strengthening their understanding of connotation and word choice before they answer similar questions on the mid-unit assessment.

- ELLs may find it challenging to read chapter 12 in its entirety during class time, as this is a long chapter. If helpful, use a Jigsaw protocol to reduce the amount of reading required for each individual. Allow students to be responsible for different, smaller portions of the text and then report back to the larger group with the gist of what they have read.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.7, 6.I.B.8, and 6.II.A.1.

Assessment Guidance

- Scan student responses on the exit ticket and make a note of students who might need additional support distinguishing the connotation of words and why authors deliberately choose words based on their connotation.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will take the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment. In the second half of Unit 2, students conduct research on another innovator who solved a critical problem using a design solution.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Preread chapter 12 in the anchor text to identify words or plot points that may challenge students.

- Review the Think-Pair-Share protocol from the Classroom Protocols document.

- Prepare copies of handouts for students, including the entrance and exit tickets (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous modules to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.6.5a (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 3**. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 3 (answers for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Using a preferred classroom routine, collect or review the answers to **Homework: Write Summary and Analyze Structure: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, **Chapter 11**. Refer to the **Homework: Write Summary and Analyze Structure: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, **Chapter 11 (answers for teacher reference)**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, Chapter 12 – RI.6.7 (25 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Read chapter 12 of the **text**, using **Text Guide: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students who are ready to read independently or in small groups should be released to this independence. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Refer to the following resources as appropriate to support this section of the lesson: **Gist anchor chart: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*** **(example for teacher reference)**, **vocabulary logs**, **Synopsis: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, **Chapter 12**, and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Gist: William uses information from the textbooks to improve on his original windmill design. He figures out how to use step up transformers and pulley systems to make his machines safer.

- Turn and Talk:

“What can you infer about how William feels about providing electricity for his home? Why do you think that?” (Student responses will vary, but may include we can infer he feels very proud because as he interviews his father, he describes how the room used to be “dark and sad” at that hour compared to how it is now.)

- Repeated routine: Using strategic groupings, invite students to work with their peers to continue updating the relevant sections of their **Design Solution: William note-catcher**. Refer to the **Design Solution: William note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** as necessary. Use a total participation technique, for example, equity sticks, to review and correct any misunderstandings before moving on.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time A, after students read chapter 12 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, invite students to participate in a Mini Language Dive in small groups to interpret a word (*reached*) used for multiple purposes within a sentence (RI.6.4, L.6.5c).

For Heavier Support

- N/A

Work Time

B. Analyze Word Connotations – L.6.5c (10 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can use differences among word connotations to determine meaning in *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*.”

- Review the meaning of the word *connotation*: an idea or quality that a word makes you think about in addition to its meaning (or *denotation*).

- Display the word *headaches*, and invite one or two students to share aloud familiar definitions of this word.

- Direct students to scan page 221 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* for the word *headaches* and mark it with a sticky note. Ask a student to read the sentence containing the word *headaches* aloud: “Any new invention is going to have problems, and aside from the patchy wiring, one of my biggest *headaches* was the bike chain.”

- Ask:

“What does the word *headaches* mean in this context?” (problems; issues)

“How is this meaning different from other meanings of *headaches*?” (The word *headaches* usually refers to a physical ailment.)

- Cue students to challenge their thinking during a Turn and Talk:

“Can you figure out why the authors used the word *headaches* instead of a word with a similar meaning, like *problems*?”

- Cold-call students to share ideas. Guide students to understand that, although some words might have a similar meaning (or denotation), the connotation may be different.

- Display two versions of the sentence from the text:

- “Any new invention is going to have problems, and aside from the patchy wiring, one of my biggest **headaches** was the bike chain.”

- “Any new invention is going to have problems, and aside from the patchy wiring, one of my biggest **problems** was the bike chain.”

- Think-Pair-Share:

“How does the authors’ use of the word *headaches* affect our understanding of the text? How would our understanding change if the authors used the word *problems*?”

- Cold-call students to share ideas. Guide students to understand that the authors’ use of the word *headaches* suggests that these problems are especially annoying or frustrating.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- After Work Time B, challenge students who need lighter support to continue examining word connotations in *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*. Provide students with a list of words and phrases from earlier chapters in the text (e.g., *fished*, page 197; *gazed*, page 198). Invite students to determine simple synonyms for the words used and explain the difference in connotation between the words and their synonyms.

For Heavier Support

- Connotation work may be especially challenging for students who lack the vocabulary needed to understand nuances in word meaning. Develop a supplemental activity for students who need heavier support. For example, invite students to use a learners’ dictionary and/or Google images to explore connotative differences between the words *home, house, dwelling*, and *residence*. Help students discover that, although these words have similar definitions, they are used in different contexts and evoke distinct images.

Closing and Assessment

A. Exit Ticket: Word Connotations – L.6.5c (5 minutes)

- Distribute **Exit Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 3** or **Exit Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 3** ▲. Direct students to reference the **Strategies to Answer Selected Response Questions anchor chart** as needed to answer the exit ticket. Refer to **Exit Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 3 (answers for teacher reference)**.

- Refocus groups after 4 minutes.

- Scan student responses and make a note of students who might need support. Check in with them moving forward.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- In the following lesson, students complete the mid-unit assessment that requires that they write an objective summary of a new text. Invite students who need lighter support to reread summaries they wrote in Unit 1 and across Module 1. While assessing their past work, students should locate specific areas of strength and areas for growth.

For Heavier Support

- During Closing and Assessment A, invite students who need heavier support to use Exit Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 3 ▲. This resource features images and a glossary of key words to support student comprehension.

Homework

A. Analyze Connotation

- Students complete **Homework: Analyze Connotation: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, **Chapter 12**.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
