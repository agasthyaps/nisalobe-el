- William assembles the windmill.

- William, Geoffrey, and Gilbert cut down trees to serve as a tower foundation for the windmill. They then use rope and pulley to hoist the windmill up the tower and secure it.

- A strong wind blows. William releases the wheel. The windmill spins. The bulb in William’s hand glows.
