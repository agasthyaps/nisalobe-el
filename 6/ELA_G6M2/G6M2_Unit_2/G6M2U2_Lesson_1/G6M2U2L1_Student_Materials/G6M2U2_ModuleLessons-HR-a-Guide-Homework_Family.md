![](media/image1.png) Guiding Questions and Big Ideas

How can design thinking help solve a critical problem?

- *Design thinking is a scientific and systematic practice of inquiry that allows for creativity and innovation.*

- *Design thinking requires scientists to identify and research problems, build prototypes, test and evaluate solutions, and redesign as needed.*

What habits of character can help solve a critical problem to contribute to a better community?

- *Effective learners demonstrate perseverance when they research, build prototypes, reflect, and revise.*

- *Ethical people contribute to a better world by applying their learning to help one’s school, community, and the environment.*

What will your student be doing at school?

In Unit 2, students finish reading *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* (Young Readers Edition). As William creates a plan for a windmill to generate electricity and ease some of the struggles caused by the famine, students take a close look at how William applies design thinking to his problem. Design thinking is not a straightforward process. Here is a visual that captures the key elements in design thinking:

Scribe Concepts for EL Education.

Students collect details from the text of William’s problems and solutions. This collection of details supports student understanding of the design thinking cycle.

Next, students begin their own research. Students research an innovator who, like William, designed a solution to a critical problem, usually by testing many failed prototypes before finally discovering some success. Besides introducing them to this worthwhile concept, students connect the habits of character to the design thinking process, noticing how empathy, initiative, and perseverance show up over and over again in the profiles of the amazing innovators they research.

Similar to the design thinking process, students learn that effective researchers follow a strategic process in order to gain both the general and specific knowledge needed to become an expert on a topic. The research process is broken down into a series of mini-lessons. The mini-lessons teach students how to skim and scan for evidence, search for sources, determine source credibility, and paraphrase and quote responsibly. Students toggle back and forth between examining models of effective research and then applying their learning to their own research. The subject of their research is self-selected from a carefully curated list of TED Talks, each featuring an extraordinary innovator whose compassion towards others motivated him/her to create a solution that would contribute to a better world. Many of the innovators featured in these TED Talks are teenagers who, like William Kamkwamba in *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, prove that young people are more than capable of tackling tough scientific challenges.

Central to the EL Education curriculum is a focus on “habits of character” and social-emotional learning. Students work to become effective learners, developing mindsets and skills for success in college, career, and life (e.g., initiative, responsibility, perseverance, collaboration); work to become ethical people, treating others well and standing up for what is right (e.g., empathy, integrity, respect, compassion); and work to contribute to a better world, putting their learning to use to improve communities (e.g., citizenship, service).

In this unit, students are trusted to work independently using devices as they conduct their research. Students understand that a key component in working to contribute to a better world is taking care of and improving shared spaces. Students demonstrate this habit of character during the research process by putting supplies away in the right place, cleaning up after themselves, and being careful not to break things, especially technology tools.

How can you support your student at home?

Watch or read local and global news with your student. Identify critical problems presented in the news outlets. Discuss what makes the problems critical.

Brainstorm with your student different design solutions that can be created to handle chores around the house.

Watch or read local and global news with your student. Brainstorm with your student different design solutions that could help solve some local and/or global problems.

Take apart an object in your home with your student. Work together to put the object back together and discuss how each piece helps the object to function.

Play logic-based games with your student that requires him/her to apply evidence in order to reach a logic-based conclusion.

Read your student’s independent research reading text at the same time as him/her. Consider asking these questions:

- How does the key individual in the text use design thinking to solve a problem?

- What stages of the design thinking process can you identify in the text?

- Is the design thinking process in the text linear? Why? Why not?

- What type of research does the key individual of the text engage in while designing the solution to the problem?

Unit 2: Homework

Homework for Lessons 2–4 focuses students on the skills of analyzing text structure, writing effective summaries, determining the connotation of words, and writing sentences in a variety of patterns.

Homework for Lessons 6–12 alternates between prereading the anchor text and independent research reading.

**Anchor Text reading:** Time limitations do not always allow for students to read entire chapters of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* to be read during class; therefore, students should preread a chapter for homework the night before it is studied in class. Reading from the anchor text will be balanced with independent research reading, which is used to deepen students’ background knowledge about the topic of the module.

**Independent research reading:** Your student is expected to independently research the topic of study in this module, Critical Problems and Design Solutions, by reading topic-related books of his or her choice. Research reading will be assigned on evenings when students are not already reading the anchor text. Students will be expected to read for approximately 20 minutes each day and respond to a prompt of choice in the front of the independent reading journal.

**Choice reading:** If your student would also like to independently read and respond to a book of free choice, he or she may use the back of the independent reading journal.

Independent Reading

**Directions:** Remember to record responses to research reading in the front of your independent reading journal and responses to choice reading in the back. Try to choose a different prompt each time.

Record any new vocabulary in your vocabulary log. Underline vocabulary found during independent reading.

**Record:**

- Date

- Title and author of your reading book

- Pages you have read

- Prompt

- Response

**Example:**

<u>Date:</u> November 14

<u>Book Title and Author:</u> *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* (Young Readers Edition) by William Kamkwamba and Bryan Mealer

<u>Pages Read:</u> 114–127

<u>Prompt:</u> Explain a way in which you connect to the text.

<u>Response:</u> Khamba is dying, and based on the suggestions from Charity, William decides to leave Khamba in the woods to pass away peacefully. My family had a dog, Maxwell, for fifteen years. Towards Maxwell’s final days, he could not get up and walk. Maxwell did not eat. My sister and brother tried to pick Maxwell up in order to put him in the car and take him to the vet to be put to sleep and end his pain. Maxwell surprised everybody by biting my sister and brother. Maxwell did not bite. He was gentle and playful. One morning, my mom went to check on Maxwell and he had passed away. We were devastated. We knew the time was coming, but Maxwell was so dear to the family. When talking about Maxwell and his uncharacteristic moment of vicious biting, we muse that Maxwell knew where my sister and brother were trying to take him, but Maxwell wanted to be at home. My family’s situation with Maxwell makes me question William’s decision: Did William really leave Khamba in the forest for Khamba’s benefit or for his own? Maxwell wanted to pass away at home, and from the way Khamba looked at William as William walked away, I’m sure Khamba would have preferred the same.

**Consider using the following independent reading prompts.**[^1]

- How does this text add to your understanding of one of the guiding questions of the module?

- Which habits of character are demonstrated in the text? Explain.

- Which habits of character are NOT demonstrated in the text? Explain.

- Record two or three facts in your own words that you learned from the text.

- Summarize your research reading today in no more than five sentences.

- Explain the critical problem an individual in the text experiences.

- How does an individual in the text demonstrate design thinking?

- Explain how you connect to the text.

- Explain how the text connects to another text you’ve read.

- Explain how the text connects to something currently happening in the world.

- How is the design thinking process in the text similar to William’s process in *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* (Young Readers Edition)?

- How does the design thinking process in the text differ from William’s process in *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* (Young Readers Edition)?

- Choose one new word from your reading today and analyze it on a vocabulary square.

Vocabulary

**Directions:** In the classroom, you have been recording words from your texts in your vocabulary log. Throughout this unit, you have been research reading topic-related books at home to build your knowledge of critical problems and design solutions and recording words in your independent reading journal.

Choose a word from your research reading or from a text you’ve read in class and add the word to your vocabulary log. Try to choose a different word to add and to practice a different vocabulary strategy each time. For each word, be sure to add the following:

1.  The definition, or meaning, of the word

<!-- -->

8.  The vocabulary strategy you used to figure out the meaning of the word

9.  A sketch or diagram that helps you to better understand the meaning of the word

Record new vocabulary in vocabulary logs and mark academic vocabulary with a symbol, for example a star:

- Academic vocabulary: words you might find in informational texts on many different topics. For example, the words *evidence* and *rationale* are words that could be found in books on any topic.

- Domain-specific vocabulary: words about a particular topic. For example, the words *tadpoles, frogspawn,* and *amphibian* are some that would be found on the topic of frogs.

**Vocabulary Strategies**

As a reminder, the following are the vocabulary strategies we’ve been working on in class:

- Context: Read the sentence around the word.

- Look at the affixes for clues.

- Look at the root of the word for clues.

- Use a dictionary.

- Discuss the word with another person (after attempting some of the above strategies).

[^1]: Some of the prompts will not be appropriate for the text students are reading. Invite students to choose a prompt that works for the text they have just read.
