Research to Discover Innovative Designers

Teaching Notes for Unit 2

Prioritize Lessons for Classrooms with Many English Language Learners

To prepare for the mid-unit assessment, prioritize and expand instruction in Lesson 1, which builds upon students’ understanding of figurative language by challenging them to determine how similes in *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* help build the text’s key ideas, and Lesson 3, whose connotation work may be especially challenging for ELLs with developing vocabularies. Lessons 6–10 feature a series of mini lessons, aimed at equipping students with the skills to tackle independent research. An ability to effectively apply these skills is critical for students’ success completing the end of unit assessment in Lesson 11 and writing problem-solution essays in Unit 3.

Language Dives

In Lessons 2 and 12, students participate in Language Dives that use sentences from their anchor text, *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*. In Lesson 2, students interpret the nuances in meanings of similar words (*flicker* versus *flash*) and practice using adverbs and conjunctions to combine sentences. In Lesson 12, students pinpoint the precise meaning of a familiar word with multiple meanings and reflect on the habits of character William demonstrates when he finds innovative uses for discarded items. Opportunities for extended practice with these sentences are available in Lessons 2 and 12 of this guide.

Students continue to routinely participate in Language Dives in Modules 2–4. See the Module 1 Teacher’s Guide for English Language Learners for details about Language Dives and why they are critical for ELLs.

Note that the Language Dive guides have been condensed in Module 2, as a way to reduce the amount of reading expected of teachers. Refer to the general best practices laid out in the Module 1 Language Dive guides.

Language Chunk Wall

Beginning in Module 2 and going forward, create a “Language Chunk Wall” to extend student capacity to use Language Dive structures. The Language Chunk Wall is an area in the classroom where students can display and categorize the academic phrases discussed in each Language Dive. At the end of each Language Dive, students are invited to place the Language Dive sentence chunk strips on the Language Chunk Wall into corresponding categories, such as “Nouns and noun phrases” or “Linking language.” See each Language Dive for suggested categories. Color-code each category for additional support. Examples: blue for nouns and subjects; purple for pronouns; red for predicates and verbs; yellow for adjectives; and green for adverbs, prepositions, and conjunctions. Students can then refer to the wall during subsequent speaking and writing tasks.

Mini Language Dives

Students continue to have the option to participate in Mini Language Dives in Unit 2. Mini Language Dives have the same overall purpose and follow the same general process as full Language Dives, but are condensed to 5 minutes, narrowing students’ attention on deconstructing the focus structure, reconstructing the sentence, and practicing the focus structure. Mini Language Dives give ELLs additional support in building language and literacy skills, as well as habits of mind. Mini Language Dives are most often optional and can be found in the corresponding lessons within this guide. When required for all students, Mini Language Dives are built into the body of the lesson in the Teacher Guide. In this unit, optional Mini Language Dives appear in Lessons 3, 9, and 10.

Diversity and Inclusion

Investigate the routines, practices, rituals, beliefs, norms, and experiences that are important to ELLs and their families. Integrate this background into the classroom as students engage with texts. Consider the values and narratives embedded in class texts and try to anticipate their relevance to ELLs. During Unit 2, students complete the anchor text, *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*. Most chapters read in Unit 2 highlight William’s design-solution process, rather than describe the drought and famine that may have been upsetting to students in Unit 1. Some chapters also reference William’s experiences as an ELL. An extension activity, aimed at affirming potentially similar experiences of ELLs, is presented in the “Opportunities to Extend Learning” section of Lesson 12. Throughout the unit, foster inclusive action by creating space for students to express their feelings about sensitive issues or content embedded in the text(s), knowing that these discussions may help create equity, amplify student voices, or unearth trauma. Be particularly sensitive to international students and ELLs from African regions, whose lived experiences may reflect or diverge from William’s in complicated or conflicting ways. Look for opportunities throughout lessons to emphasize the heterogeneity of African communities and African lives. Consult with a guidance counselor, school social worker, or ESL teacher for further investigation of diversity and inclusion.

Conversation Cues

Encourage productive and equitable conversation with Conversation Cues, which are questions to ask students that help achieve four goals:

- (Goal 1) encourage all students to talk and be understood;

- (Goal 2) listen carefully to one another and seek to understand;

- (Goal 3) deepen thinking; and

- (Goal 4) think with others to expand the conversation (adapted from Michaels, Sarah, and Cathy O’Connor. *Talk Science Primer*. TERC, 2012. http://inquiryproject.terc.edu/shared/pd/TalkScience_Primer.pdf. Based on Chapin, S., O’Connor, C., N. and Anderson. \[2009\]. *Classroom Discussions: Using Math Talk to Help Students Learn, Grades K–6*. Second Edition. Math Solutions Publications).

Refer to the Tools Page (http://eled.org/tools) for the complete set of cues. Goal 1 Conversation Cues were introduced in Module 1, Unit 1, and Goal 2 Conversation Cues were introduced in Module 1, Unit 3; both will continue to be used throughout this module. Goal 3 Conversation Cues are introduced in Lesson 1, and suggestions for integrating Conversation Cues into instruction are presented across lessons. For ELLs, Conversation Cues are especially critical because they improve language processing abilities and increase engagement and participation.

Strategic Grouping

Students work in pairs and small groups to analyze texts and prepare for text-based discussions. While reading the anchor text in class, students can read independently, in pairs or small groups, or as a full class. In this unit, cultivate ELLs’ autonomy and flexibility by encouraging them to vary their reading habits.

Research Mini Lessons

In this unit, students begin to conduct independent research into another innovator who, like William, used design solutions to solve critical problems. Lessons 6–10 feature research mini lessons, aimed at strengthening students’ abilities to locate, interpret, paraphrase, cite, and synthesize external sources. Mini lessons are followed by open research time, during which students can directly apply what they have learned to their own work. These research tasks may be especially challenging for ELLs, as the tasks require integrating reading, writing, and listening skills. Remind students that no one is an expert researcher right away and that the purpose of the mini lessons is to help students build the research skills they can use later. The independent research that students conduct during this unit will inform the problem-solution essay that students write during the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment.

Differentiated Materials

Differentiated materials are available for ELLs and other students who would benefit from an increased level of support. These resources have been modified for the purposes of creating accessibility to content and concepts and supporting language development. Depending upon the task being carried out with a material, images, selected response options, answer banks, sentence frames, or model responses have been embedded to guide students’ thinking without compromising a focus on standards and the skills that students are developing and applying to meet them.

Celebration

Celebrate the courage, enthusiasm, diversity, and bilingual assets that ELLs bring to the classroom. Additionally, students can celebrate their successful attempts at communication and their ability to extend and enhance the discussions.
