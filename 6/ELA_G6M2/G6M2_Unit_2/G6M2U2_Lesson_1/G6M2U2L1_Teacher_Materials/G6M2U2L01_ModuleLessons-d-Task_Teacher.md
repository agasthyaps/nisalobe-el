W.6.10, L.6.5a

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** William uses figurative language to describe the complicated technical parts of his work. Think of something that you are an expert in. Use figurative language to describe it in a way that helps others to understand it.

Here are some things you might be an expert in:

- Playing video games

- Cooking

- Playing basketball

- Playing piano

- Singing

- Something else?

Answers will vary. Sample response: One of my strengths is playing chess. A lesson I learned early on in playing chess is that you cannot be focused only on your next move, you have to think about the bigger picture. You have to think several moves ahead and plan how this one turn will set you up to be successful several moves later in the game. Think of it like baking a cake. Each ingredient on its own, like flour or salt or baking soda, may not be very tasty. But when you put all of those ingredients together, you get a delicious cake. Similarly, if you leave out just one ingredient, or add it in at the wrong time, you can mess up the whole process. This is also true in chess where every move, played at just the right time, can add up to a win.
