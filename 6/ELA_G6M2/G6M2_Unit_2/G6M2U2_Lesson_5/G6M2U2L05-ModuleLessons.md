Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.6.5 – Work Time A: Students work together to analyze the function of individual paragraphs within the overall structure of “The Hippo Roller,” the informational text they read during the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment of the previous lesson, and also analyze how each helps to develop a central idea.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time B: Students begin the Critical Problem and Design Solution Research Project, which requires that they cite textual evidence to support their investigation of an innovator who used design thinking to develop a solution to a critical problem.

- RI.6.7 – Work Time B: Students begin to integrate information presented in multiple formats (i.e., text and video) to develop a coherent understanding of a critical problem and its solution.

- W.6.7 – Work Time B: Students begin a research project to answer a series of questions about critical problems and their design solutions.

- W.6.8 – Work Time B: Students begin to gather relevant information from multiple sources, assess their credibility, and quote and paraphrase data.

- SL.6.2 – Work Time B: Students begin to interpret information presented in diverse media and formats and explain how it is related to their topic.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Students who have experience with any of the research steps should be authorized as experts on those steps and allowed to teach or mentor the class or individual students on the steps. Also, these students can be released to work immediately on research rather than attending to the mini lessons on the research steps.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Students have been learning about the design thinking process and following William’s story in their anchor text as he applies the process to solve a critical problem in his community. In this lesson, students begin their research to learn about another innovator who designed a solution to a different critical problem. Over the next several lessons, students will follow the research process to learn about this innovator and prepare to present their finding at the Solution Symposium.

Support All Students

- Note that there is a differentiated version of the entrance ticket used in Opening A in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- ELLs may find it challenging to independently watch, comprehend, and select from the list of TED Talks. Consider providing short, simple blurbs of two or three talks for students to read before they watch the videos. Additionally, many TED Talks feature the option of adding subtitles or slowing down speech. Transcripts are also often available (sometimes in more than one language). Acquaint students with these functions and encourage students to use them as necessary to support their understanding of the videos. ▲

- Remind students that they have a limited amount of time to view the TED Talks during this lesson. Ensure that they have really narrowed down on the talks that most pique their interest to make the best use of their time.

- Explain to students that some presenters have given multiple talks, like William himself, and some titles have similar keywords. Ensure that students search very carefully for the correct presenter and title, making an exact match to the information on the Innovator Options list.

- To support ELLs, this lesson invites students to revisit a familiar informational text, “The Hippo Roller,” which students saw for the first time during the mid-unit assessment of the previous lesson. Students work together to analyze the text’s problem-solution structure, helping to prepare for them to write their own problem-solution essays in Unit 3. Working with familiar texts, especially for a new purpose, helps students automatize their abilities to decode language and improves their comprehension of the text, leading to more confident and fluent readers. In this lesson, students also begin independent research about another innovator who used design thinking to solve a critical problem.

- ELLs may find it intimidating to begin a large-scale independent research project. Ease students’ nerves by pointing out that the next five lessons contain “mini lessons” aimed at different components of the research process. Students will have the opportunity to learn new research skills and immediately apply them to their own work. Regular debriefs with classmates throughout the research-driven lessons will also provide ample time to reflect on progress, ask clarifying questions, and set goals.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.2, 6.I.B.6, 6.I.C.11, and 6.II.A.1.

Assessment Guidance

- Circulate to monitor students’ ability to follow the TED Talks and make annotations on their Innovator Options list about their subject of interest. Monitor common issues to address in the next lesson.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will focus on the next step of the research process, skimming and scanning for evidence. Besides the TED Talk, students need to find another source about their topic and record their research on the Design Solution: Research note-catcher.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare the Researchers Do These Things anchor chart.

- Before modeling the research process for students, test drive the research process and preview the TED Talks introduced in Work Time B. Practice the process to ensure the links work and the process goes smoothly. Choose one as the focus of the Think Aloud during Work Time B.

- Consider whether students will be allowed to choose other talks besides those listed on the Innovator Options list. Fifteen options have been provided; more than one student will likely need to choose the same innovator. Consider seeking out additional talks appropriate to the task, if having a different innovator per student is preferred.

- Gather devices on which students can conduct research (computers or tablets). Ensure the devices work, are charged, and can access the internet.

- Review the student tasks and example answers to get familiar with what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Prepare copies of handouts for students, including the entrance ticket (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time A: Utilize a computer or tablet with projector to demonstrate the research process.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.6.10 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 5** or the optional **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 5** ▲. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 5 (example for teacher reference)** for possible responses. Students will also need their anchor text, ***The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***.

- Explain that students will not analyze chapter 13 in its entirety but rather zoom in on the most important parts in this lesson’s entrance ticket as well as the next lesson.

- Direct students to the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart** and the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**. Invite students to choose a habit of character to demonstrate during today’s lesson, just as William did as he engaged in his own learning experiences.

- Using a preferred classroom routine, collect or review the answers to **Homework: Vary Sentence Patterns**. Refer to the **Homework: Vary Sentence Patterns (answers for teacher reference)**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

- With students, use vocabulary strategies to deconstruct the word *research* (to look into carefully and closely to learn the facts). Record on the **academic word wall** with translations in home languages, where appropriate ▲, and invite students to record in their **vocabulary logs**.

For Lighter Support

- N/A

For Heavier Support

- During Opening A, invite students who need heavier support to use Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 5 ▲. This resource includes partially completed sentence frames to support students’ writing, as well as a definition of *initiative* to remind students of a relevant habit of character.

Work Time

A. Analyze Structure: “The Hippo Roller” – RI.6.5 (15 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target:

“I can analyze how individual paragraphs fit into the structure of a text and contribute to the development of ideas.”

- Distribute and display **Analyze Structure: “The Hippo Roller,”** and remind students they read and analyzed this article during the End of Unit 1 Assessment. Explain that they’re going to take a closer look at the structure of this article by thinking at the paragraph level.

- Invite students to quickly review the article provided on the Analyze Structure: “The Hippo Roller” handout.

- Using a total participation technique, invite responses from the group:

“What is this article about?” (It is about the invention of the hippo roller, a device that allows people to easily carry water far distances.)

“Which sentence from the article best conveys a central idea?” (“The Hippo Water Roller provides life-giving water and empowers users, mainly women and children, to put more of their time towards improving their communities and their own lives.” \[paragraph 4\]).

- Remind students the quote above was a question on the End of Unit 1 Assessment. Have students underline this sentence on their handout.

“What is the overall structure used in this article?” (Problem/Solution.)

- Remind students the quote above was a question on the End of Unit 1 Assessment.

- As needed, cue students to provide reasoning or evidence for their answers:

“Why do you think that? What, in the text, makes you think so?” (The first two paragraphs name and give details about the problem—difficulty of obtaining water. The second two paragraphs name and give details about the solution—the Hippo Roller.)

- Read aloud the directions. Using a total participation technique, invite responses from the group:

“Who can rephrase the directions in their own words?” (Answers will vary. Students should indicate they are going to think about the function and purpose of each paragraph in the article.)

- Review the completed row for paragraph 1 with the students. Clarify any misunderstandings or questions as needed. Direct students to work in pairs to complete the Analyze Structure: “The Hippo Roller.” If time is a concern, assign paragraphs to pairs rather than having each pair analyze all of the paragraphs. If using this option, ensure students take notes during the review so they have all of the information on their note-catcher.

- Using a total participation technique, invite responses from the group to review the answers. Refer to **Analyze Structure: “The Hippo Roller” (example for teacher reference)**.

- Ask:

“Why did we do this analysis? Why is it important to think about the function of paragraphs in a text?” (Answers will vary. Each paragraph has a job to do, and it’s important to understand how each part fits into the larger structure and works to convey the ideas and what happens if a piece is removed.)

- Explain that they have taken this time to analyze the individual paragraphs in “The Hippo Roller” because they’ll be writing their own problem-solution texts, which they’re going to start learning more about right now.

Work Time

B. Introduce Research Project – W.6.7, W.6.8 (15 minutes)

- Inform students that in this lesson, they will begin to research to learn about another innovator who used the design thinking process to solve a critical problem.

- Distribute and display the **Critical Problem and Design Solution Research Project** handout.

- Read aloud the first two paragraphs under the Research Question on the handout. Pause and ask:

“What do you notice about this research assignment? What do you wonder?”

- Provide quiet think time while students reflect; encourage them to record their notices and wonders on the handout. Using a total participation technique, invite students to share their initial notices and clarify their wonders.

- Point to the research question in bold at the top of the handout: How was design thinking used to solve a critical problem? Before teaching students the steps of researching, invite them to Think-Write-Pair-Share in response to the following question:

“How might you research to answer this question? What are the steps you would take?”

- During the share, note the correct responses in the correct order on the **Researchers Do These Things anchor chart**. See the **Researchers Do These Things anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**. Explain that, for this project, the research question has already been given to students; however, they may refine the question or create smaller subquestions as they choose and learn more about their topic.

- Students may feel overwhelmed by the number of steps in the research process. Invite them to circle or star number one on the list at the bottom of their Research Project handout. Tell students that today they need only focus on the first step. Remind students that they will be guided through every step of the process and be given time in class to work on each.

- Incorporate reflection on and awareness of the following academic mindset: “I can succeed at this.”

- Ask:

“What resources can you use to be successful at this research project?” (Researchers Do These Things anchor chart, Critical Problem and Design Solution Research Project handout, Design Solution: William note-catcher, peers, and the teacher.)

- Allow time for students to read through the titles of the TED Talks and the brief descriptions on the Innovator Options page of the Research Project handout.

- Model the thought process of choosing one, then follow the directions to find the talk on TED.com.

- Explain that students will have time today only to view one or two talks but they can continue viewing outside of class and in the following lesson. Model how to play the video and make notes in the margins of the Innovator Options page to record the subject and why it was or was not of interest.

- Demonstrate how students, as an option, can turn on the subtitles for the talk and click on the Transcript option to make it easier to follow along. ▲

- Pause to clarify any misunderstandings.

- Ensure that every student has a working **device** on which to access TED.com and view the talks. Release students to begin their research.

- With one minute remaining, ask students to pause their research and put away their devices.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the learning target.

For Lighter Support

- The Critical Problem and Design Solution Research Project handout, distributed during Work Time B, lists seven detailed steps that students will complete across the course of their research projects. In these steps, major verbs have been underlined in order to draw students’ attention to the actions required of them (e.g., *explore, choose, plan, assess*). Develop a supplemental activity in which these verbs are distributed to students ahead of time (e.g., on paper strips). Invite students to attempt to rearrange the verbs in the order students may expect to find them on the handout. Students can then verify their answers after receiving the handout. This exercise incorporates direct vocabulary practice, improves student awareness of parts of speech, exercises critical thinking abilities, and increases student investment in the research project.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time B, students may feel overwhelmed by the amount of text on the Critical Problem and Design Solution Research Project handout. Break up the handout into strips that can be delivered to students across multiple lessons. For example, in this lesson, display the complete handout so that students understand the arc of the project; then, distribute to students a strip that contains only the first step (of seven) to be completed across the course of the project.

Closing and Assessment

A. QuickWrite: Research Debrief – W.6.10 (10 minutes)

- Distribute **QuickWrite: Research Debrief**. Explain that students will have time now to record their initial thoughts about the TED Talks they viewed today.

- Encourage students to write continuously until time is up. Collect student responses to review later. Plan to check in with students who may be struggling.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- N/A

For Heavier Support

- If needed, replace the small group discussion of Closing and Assessment A with an exit ticket activity in which students pose questions to clarify expectations of the research project. Address recurring or critical questions with the full class at the beginning of the next lesson. At this early stage in the research process, it is imperative that all students understand the expectations of the project. Asking questions via an exit ticket reduces the embarrassment that may accompany a request to clarify information that was misunderstood.

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
