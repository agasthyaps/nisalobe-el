(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Determine the function or purpose for each paragraph of the article: How does each paragraph fit into the overall structure of the article? Add your responses in the second column of the table below. (The first row has been completed for you as a model.) Then, complete the questions below the table.

<li><p>Water is necessary to drink, clean, cook food, grow crops, and stay healthy, yet many people struggle to live without this essential resource. According to the World Health Organization, 4 out of every 10 people live without access to safe water. Pettie Petzer and Johan Jonker, two South Africans who grew up on farms, invented the Hippo Water Roller to address this critical problem.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>It tells what the problem is (clean water access).</p></li>
<li><p>It tells a bit about the solution (the Hippo Roller).</p></li>

<li><p>Johan Jonker noticed workers on his father’s farm using 5-gallon plastic buckets to gather and carry water. He knew the containers were of poor quality and not very durable, but that wasn’t the only problem. And it wasn’t just a problem for his father’s farm. In fact, there are millions of women and children who use those same 5-gallon buckets to collect water, walking up to 6 hours every day and balancing the heavy containers on their heads. This not only takes up precious time that could be used for more important activities, but it causes neck and spine damage besides being exhausting. Jonker and Petzer knew that there had to be a better way.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>It details the specifics of the problem and who it affected.</strong></p></li>

<li><p>The two inventors’ first try at solving this problem was based on a wheelbarrow, with one wheel supporting a large area used to carry the water. This initial idea failed because the price of the wheel was much too expensive. Petzer thought, “Let’s put the water inside the wheel!” And the Hippo Water Roller was born. The Hippo Roller is a large barrel attached to a handle that allows users to collect more water and easily roll it back to their homes.</p></li>

<li><p>Petzer and Jonker’s solution has had tremendous impact. Users can now collect 25 gallons of water in one trip, and they can do it with less physical strain. “I used to fetch water six or seven times a day,” reports one user. “Now with the Hippo, I do it once every two or three days.” With the Hippo Roller, women and children are collecting more than just water; they are also collecting time. Children are now attending school, and women are being trained in skills to start a business and earn income in the time that they used to spend getting water. Also, with more time to cultivate and irrigate their fields, farmers can now grow more crops. <u>The Hippo Water Roller provides life-giving water and empowers users, mainly women and children, to put more of their time towards improving their communities and their own lives.</u></p></li>

<li><p><strong>It details the impact of the solution on the users and community.</strong></p></li>

**Directions:** Review the sentence you underlined above, the one that best conveys a central idea of the article.

Explain how each paragraph contributes to the development of that central idea. (Paragraph 1 has been completed for you as a model.) Then, explain the impact on the reader’s understanding of that central idea if that paragraph was removed from the essay.

**Paragraph 1**

This paragraph contributes to the development of the central idea by making clear the critical nature of the problem and that a solution was created to solve that problem.

Without this paragraph the article would still make sense, but the reader wouldn’t understand how widespread and serious the problem is.

**Paragraph 2**

This paragraph contributes to the development of the central idea by

explaining more details about the impact of the problem on the women and children who had to transport the water. It makes clear that there were physical impacts as well as loss of time.

Without this paragraph

the reader wouldn’t understand the how difficult the problem was and wouldn’t understand how the solution also gave the users back some time, not just less strain on their bodies.

**Paragraph 3**

This paragraph contributes to the development of the central idea by

explaining more details about how the inventors created their solution.

Without this paragraph

the article would still make sense, but the reader wouldn’t be able to learn about the design thinking process they went through, including their failed attempts, to solve this problem, and we also wouldn’t have a clear picture of what the device looks like.

**  
Paragraph 4**

This paragraph contributes to the development of the central idea by

explaining the impact the invention had for users.

Without this paragraph

the article would still make sense but it would feel unfinished and the reader wouldn’t be able to hear from the users, which really helps to convey the central idea.
