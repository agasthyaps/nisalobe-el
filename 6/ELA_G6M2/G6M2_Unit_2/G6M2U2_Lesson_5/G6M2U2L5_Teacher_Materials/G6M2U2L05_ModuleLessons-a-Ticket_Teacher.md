| **initiative** (noun): the energy and desire to do something that is needed or helpful. |

William demonstrates initiative by (hint: start with verb + -ing) thinking of a new project to take on and returning to the library for inspiration. William recognizes that if he does not set goals for himself, he will become like the “ghosts” in the trading center, hanging around with no ambition. William seeks out new ways to improve his community by researching new projects he can undertake.
