(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, read the learning targets. Next, read an excerpt of chapter 13 in *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, starting on page 233 at “The pump was a failure . . .” and ending on page 237 at “. . . it wasn’t the right time.”

Which habits of character does William demonstrate in this excerpt? Reference the Work to Become Effective Learners and Work to Become Ethical People anchor charts. Use specific details from the text to explain your inferences.

Answers will vary. Sample response: William demonstrates perseverance as he continually tries new projects despite several failures. For example, he attempted to make biogas from goat poop but ended up exploding poopy water all over his kitchen. William is motivated by trying to find a way for his mother to cook without needing to chop down trees and build smoky fires indoors. This desire helps fuel his perseverance.
