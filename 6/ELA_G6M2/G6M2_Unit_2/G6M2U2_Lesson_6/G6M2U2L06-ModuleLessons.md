Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.6.1 – Work Time A: Students analyze a model of the Design Solution: Research note-catcher, noting ways in which textual evidence is used to support analysis of a critical problem and its design solution.

- W.6.8 – Work Time A: Students note ways in which relevant information is gathered from multiple sources and credibility is assessed on the Model Design Solution: “Bridges to Prosperity” note-catcher.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time B: Students begin to complete their Design Solution: Research note-catchers, using textual evidence to support their analysis of a critical problem and its design solution.

- W.6.7 – Work Time B: Students review TED Talks from the previous lesson and add to their note-catchers, gathering information to answer questions about critical problems and their design solutions.

- RI.6.7 – Work Time B: Students add to their note-catchers and integrate information presented in multiple formats (i.e., text and video) to develop a coherent understanding of a critical problem and its solution.

- SL.6.2 – Work Time B: Students add to their note-catchers and interpret information presented in diverse media and formats and explain how it is related to their topic.

- RI.6.7 – Closing and Assessment A: Students participate in a small group discussion to share the information they have collected from multiple media sources.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Students who have experience with any of the research steps should be authorized as experts on those steps and allowed to teach or mentor the class or individual students on the steps.

- Invite students to extend their research beyond TED Talks based on ideas they may have read about in independent reading texts

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In Lesson 5, students were introduced to the Critical Problems and Design Solutions Research Project. They were introduced to the steps for researching to answer a question and began researching briefly. In this lesson, students will analyze a model note-catcher to understand the type of information they should be looking for as they continue previewing TED Talks to determine the topic of their research project. They will also continue reading the anchor text and reflecting on William’s character.

Support All Students

- In Work Time B, students may need additional support with the steps of the research process. Partner these students with a student who is skilled at researching and note-taking for modeling and support. ▲

- Distilling information from additional media, like videos, may be difficult for ELLs. Demonstrate how students can use subtitles and/or the provided transcripts to follow along more easily. Additionally, make the video link available for students to rewatch independently later. ▲

- Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this lesson that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually.

- To support ELLs, this lesson features the first in a series of mini lessons meant to prepare students to conduct independent research. In this lesson, students are led through an analysis of a model Design Solution: Research note-catcher. Guiding students through a model note-catcher as a class before asking them to independently begin to complete their own helps clarify expectations of the assignment and sets standards of quality that students can work toward.

- ELLs may find it challenging to adequately manage their time during the open research time of Work Time B. Work with students who need heavier support to set manageable timed goals for the day. Check in with the feasibility of these goals at the end of class and adjust goals as needed in the following lesson.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.2, 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.7, 6.I.B.8, 6.I.C.11, 6.I.C.12, 6.II.B.5, 6.II.C.6, and 6.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- Circulate to monitor students’ ability to follow the TED Talks and make annotations on their Innovator Options list or on their Design Solution: Research note-catcher about their subject of interest. Monitor common issues to use to address in the next lesson. Push students to make a choice or be very close to choosing their innovator by the end of the lesson.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue filling in their Design Solution: Research note-catcher with evidence from their chosen TED Talk and another source that they will find. Plan to also add to the Work to Contribute to a Better World anchor chart.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Watch the TED Talk: Avery Bang: “Building Bridges and Connecting Communities” and review the information on the Model Design Solution: “Bridges to Prosperity” note-catcher to become familiar with the topic in preparation for modeling how knowledgeable students should be about their own topics. If available, load the TED Talk: Avery Bang: “Building Bridges and Connecting Communities.” Note that this particular talk is part of the TED Archives and is only available via *YouTube*, not TED.com. Watching the video is not a requirement of this lesson. The lesson can be completed even if this video is no longer available via *YouTube*.

- Gather devices on which students can conduct research (computers or tablets). Ensure the devices work, are charged, and can access the internet.

- Review the student tasks and example answers to get familiar with what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Prepare copies of handouts for students, including the entrance ticket (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time A: Load the TED Talk: Avery Bang: “Building Bridges and Connecting Communities.” Note that this particular talk is part of the TED Archives and is only available via *YouTube*, not TED.com. Display the website and guide students to find each item (author’s last and first name, article title, website, etc.).

- Work Time A: As time allows, play part of or the entire TED Talk: Avery Bang: “Building Bridges and Connecting Communities” for students; note, however, that this is not a requirement of this lesson. In the following lesson, students will read the transcript of a key excerpt of this video to locate relevant information for their note-catchers and then, if *YouTube* is available in the classroom, watch the excerpt as a class.

- Work Time B: Provide computers or tablets for each student to continue the research process.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.6.10 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 6**. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 6 (example for teacher reference)** for possible responses. Students will also need their anchor text, ***The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***.

- Direct students to the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart** and the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**. Invite students to choose a habit of character to demonstrate during today’s lesson, just as William did as he engaged in his own learning experiences.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

- The entrance tickets in Lessons 5 and 6 feature the same prompt: students are asked to reread an excerpt from *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* and comment on the habits of character that William demonstrates in the excerpt. Invite students to compare their responses to these entrance tickets and generate a word/phrase bank and sentence frames based on the repeated vocabulary and structures they locate in their responses. This exercise will help students recognize the usefulness of formulaic language and strengthen their awareness of overall structure.

For Heavier Support

- The entrance tickets of Lessons 5 and 6 feature the same prompt: students are asked to reread an excerpt from *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* and comment on the habits of character that William demonstrates in the excerpt. Invite students to compare their responses to these entrance tickets and reflect on the process of answering similar questions more than once (i.e., Were they able to write more quickly? With more confidence? With clearer ideas?). Use this exercise to help students recognize the importance of practice in improving language skills.

Work Time

A. Mini Lesson: Analyze Model Note-Catcher – W.6.8 (10 minutes)

- Distribute the **Design Solution: Research note-catcher**. Explain that this note-catcher answers the same questions as the Design Solution: William note-catcher introduced in Unit 1.

- Explain that some students may have decided on an innovator they want to research in the previous lesson. If students are ready for the next step, they will begin filling in the blank Design Solution: Research note-catcher during this lesson after a second viewing of their chosen TED Talk.

- Introduce students to the **TED Talk by Avery Bang** called “Building Bridges and Connecting Communities,” and explain that it will be used as a model of the process students will follow. Explain that students may <u>not</u> use this talk for their own research project.

- Distribute the **Researcher’s Tool Box** handout, and draw attention to the citing sources format in the Citing Sources section. Display the **Model Design Solution: “Bridges to Prosperity” note-catcher**. Point out where the bibliographic information for this source has been recorded in the bibliographic information row under Part II: Source Information. Remind students that they will eventually find another source to add to their research on this topic, hence the references to Sources 1 and 2.

- Move back to Part I: Research Details, section A. General Overview. Offer some basic background about the issue discussed in the TED Talk (Avery Bang learned that many communities cannot access schools, hospitals, or marketplaces simply because there are no bridges to help them get over dangerous rivers and ravines. She joined an organization called Bridges to Prosperity to engineer bridges in these communities and end rural isolation.) Model filling in the General Overview section on the model note-catcher.

- Invite students to put a star next to the two places on their Design Solution: William note-catcher that were part of the modeling. Remind students that these are the only sections they should fill in at this time. Pause to check for understanding and field questions.

- Explain that some students will not be ready to fill in the note-catcher today; they may need to use the time to continue viewing TED Talks. Assure them that this is okay, although they should have a good idea of which Innovator Option they will pursue by the end of the lesson.

Work Time

B. Research: Review TED Talks – W.6.7, W.6.8 (20 minutes)

- Distribute the **QuickWrite: Research Debrief** that students completed at the end of the previous lesson. Allow students one minute to review which TED Talks they have already explored and where they planned to pick up their work in today’s lesson.

- Ensure each student has a device connected to the internet and is able to access TED.com. Release students to continue watching TED Talks or to rewatch the TED Talk they chose in the previous lesson and begin filling in their Design Solution: Research note-catcher.

- Three minutes before the end of the time, ask students to pause their research and put away their devices. Then refocus the group and invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Closing and Assessment

A. Small Group Discussion – RI.6.7 (5 minutes)

- Have students review their notes and annotate the most interesting or strongest information they found so far. Invite students to retrieve their **dance cards**. Name a dance partner group for students to join.

- Reminding students of the **Discussion Norms anchor chart**, invite students to begin sharing the information they chose. Circulate and monitor, reminding students that this is a good way to hear about other TED Talks they may not have had time to view. If something a peer shares interests them, they should make a note and consider switching their chosen innovator.

- Refocus the class. Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- N/A

For Heavier Support

- During the small group discussion of Closing and Assessment A, encourage ELLs who need heavier support to discuss their research findings with peers who share the same home language. This may help students better process the information they have gathered so far and more easily clarify misunderstandings.

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
