# Lesson 6: Conduct Research: Analyze a Model
**Grade 6: Module 2: Unit 2: Lesson 6**

**Summary:** Students analyze a model of the Design Solution: Research note-catcher, noting ways in which relevant information is gathered from multiple sources and credibility is assessed. Students review TED Talks from the previous lesson and add to their note-catchers, gathering information to answer question

**Focus Standards:** RI.6.1, RI.6.7, W.6.7, W.6.8, SL.6.2

**Learning Targets:**
- I can analyze a model research note-catcher for effective note-taking and evidence. (W.6.8)
- I can conduct research to answer questions about another design solution that solved a critical problem. (W.6.7, W.6.8)

**Agenda:** Opening → Engage the Learner – W.6.10 (5 minutes) → Work Time → Mini Lesson: Analyze a Model Note-Catcher – W.6.8 (15 minutes) → Research: Review TED Talks – W.6.7, W.6.8 (20 minutes) → Closing and Assessment
