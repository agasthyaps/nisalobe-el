Critical Problems and Design Solutions

Grade 6: Module 2: Unit 2: Lesson 10

Lesson Overview

Lesson Summary

After students read an excerpt from chapter 14 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, they add to their Design Solution: William note-catchers, using textual evidence to support their analysis of the text’s ideas. Students participate in a mini lesson to help them quote or paraphrase information from sources they find without plagiarizing. Then, students interpret their sources, presented in diverse media and formats, and quote or paraphrase them for their own research.

- W.6.8 – Closing and Assessment A: Students participate in a small group discussion to share progress on their research and identify sources they found.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Students who have experience with any of the research steps should be authorized as experts on those steps and allowed to teach or mentor the class or individual students on the steps.

- An optional Mini Language Dive, intended for use after students complete the chapter 14 excerpt in Work Time A, is available in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students learned to determine the credibility of the sources they found during their research. In this lesson, students practice quoting accurately and responsibly from those sources, avoiding plagiarism by citing their sources or paraphrasing. They read the first half of chapter 14 of the anchor text in the previous lesson; they will finish reading the chapter in this lesson.

Support All Students

- Visual examples of bibliographic information and quoting practices can be useful resources for students. Make examples available for students to refer to as needed.

- Paraphrasing is especially challenging for ELLs, who may lack the language skills needed to produce alternative ways of stating an idea. Provide as many examples as possible of successful paraphrases, showing students that paraphrasing does not require complex language use. ▲

- Support students at varied reading levels by recommending databases for different reading levels (e.g., Newsela or Gale). ▲

- Continue to monitor students to determine if there are issues surfacing as a result of the content of this lesson that need to be discussed as a whole group, in smaller groups, or individually.

- To support ELLs, this lesson guides students in responsibly paraphrasing and quoting information from external sources. Students have the opportunity to glean insights from a model exercise with the whole class before applying their learning independently. As a source of additional support, the Researcher’s Tool Box handout offers specific instructions for quoting internet sources accurately.

- ELLs may find it challenging to paraphrase information from new texts, as this requires a high level of reading comprehension and the ability to manipulate sentence structures and vocabulary to faithfully represent ideas in new ways. Point out that, although successful paraphrasing requires integrating a number of disparate skills, students have had already had practice developing these skills across Modules 1 and 2. Remind them, too, that paraphrasing is a skill that students at all academic levels have to learn and practice; no one is an expert right away.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.2, 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.7, 6.I.B.8, 6.I.C.11, 6.I.C.12, 6.II.B.5, 6.II.C.6, and 6.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- Circulate to monitor students’ ability to quote accurately and responsibly from their sources.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will complete the End of Unit 2 Assessment to demonstrate their research skills. In Lesson 12, students should be prepared to share their learning from their independent research reading assignment.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.6.8 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 10**. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 10 (example for teacher reference)** for possible responses.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, Chapter 14 excerpt – RI.6.7 (10 minutes)

- Explain to students that chapter 14 is an especially long chapter; they started it in the previous lesson and will read the second half in this lesson. Today students will read from page 252 starting at “After visiting my house . . . ” and ending at the conclusion of the chapter on page 259.

- Repeated routine: Read the excerpt of chapter 14 of the **text**, using **Text Guide: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students who are ready to read independently or in small groups should be released to this independence. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Refer to the following resources as appropriate to support this section of the lesson: **Gist anchor chart: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*** **(example for teacher reference)**; **Synopsis: *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, **Chapter 14**; **vocabulary logs**; and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Gist: William is rewarded with enrollment at a special school and an invitation to speak at a TED conference in Tanzania.

- Turn and Talk:

“Going back to school isn’t easy for William. Why is it challenging?” (Student responses will vary, but may include he is teased because he is older, he has to share a bed and clean the urinals.)

“What can you infer William feels about this? Why do you think that?” (Student responses will vary, but may include he wasn’t bothered about being teased because it says so, but he was uncomfortable with the state of the school because he describes the dorms as dirty, the smell of the urinals, and how the rooms were ‘cramped.’ He also describes the feet of the boy he had to share a bed with.)

“As you read about the hardships William faced, what habits of character are you practicing? Why?” (Student responses will vary, but may include empathy and compassion for the challenges he and the other boys were facing just to get an education.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time A, after students read the chapter 14 excerpt of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, invite them to participate in a Mini Language Dive in small groups to analyze the role of commas to offset information in a sentence and improve clarity (L.6.2a).

- Develop an extension activity using the sentence from the Mini Language Dive suggested during Work Time A: “However, I did become homesick, and whenever that happened, I’d hide away in the school library, where the books filled rows and rows of shelves.” For instance, invite students to examine the uses and functions of the four commas used in this sentence and deductively generate guidelines for comma use.

Work Time

B. Mini Lesson: Paraphrase and Quote Responsibly – W.6.8 (20 minutes)

- Remind students that, in the previous lesson, they practiced evaluating sources for credibility.

- Explain that once researchers have identified a credible source, they must find relevant information and record that information in a responsible way.

- Display Ashden Climate Solutions in Action Website: Bridges to Prosperity, (http://eled.org/0178) and distribute the **Practice Paraphrasing and Quoting** handout.

- Model skimming and scanning the first section of the source for information. Identify a single sentence from the source that answers any of the questions on the research note-catcher. Explain this quote should be recorded. Researchers have to decide if they will use the quote with its exact wording or restate it in their own words. Explain that restating the information is called *paraphrasing* and that using someone else’s work without giving them credit is called *plagiarism*.

- Turn and Talk:

“Why is it important to avoid plagiarism by citing the source or paraphrasing?” (Plagiarism is dishonest. Just as stealing another’s property is illegal, so is stealing another’s ideas.)

- Invite students to retrieve the **Researcher’s Tool Box** handout and refer to the Quoting Accurately section. Demonstrate the two options for recording the quote in the relevant section of the research note-catcher: giving credit to the source and paraphrasing it. Record these options in the right-hand column of the Practice Paraphrasing and Quoting handout. Refer to the **Practice Paraphrasing and Quoting (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Repeat this process with the next two sections, asking students to help paraphrase and quote, and recording their answers in the right-hand column of the handout. If they are able, release students to repeat this process in pairs for the second section and independently for the third section.

- Add these steps to the **Researchers Do These Things anchor chart**. Refer to the **Researchers Do These Things anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Check for understanding using a total participation technique, such as Thumb-O-Meter.

- Invite students to retrieve their **Design Solution: Research note-catcher**.

- Ensure each student has a **device** connected to the internet and is able to access to the internet. Release students to find credible sources that enhance their understanding of their chosen topic and how the innovator used design thinking to solve a critical problem. Aid them in properly quoting and paraphrasing information from their source to fill in the Design Solution: Research note-catcher.

- Three minutes before the end of the time, ask students to pause their research and put away their devices. Then refocus the group and invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time B, create and displaying a visual that illustrates for students the many familiar components that go into paraphrasing information. These may include the following: understanding the meaning of the words as they authors used them and locating words with similar meanings; identifying text structure and using other words that signal the same structure; varying sentence patterns from combining or separating sentences in an excerpt.

Closing and Assessment

A. Small Group Discussion – W.6.8 (10 minutes)

- Have students review their notes and annotate the most interesting or strongest information they found so far. Invite students to retrieve their **dance cards**. Name a dance partner group for students to join.

- Reminding students of the **Discussion Norms anchor chart**, invite students to begin sharing the information they chose. Guide students to share specific information by using prompts, such as “What are you excited about?”, “What new questions arose during your research?”, “What are your next steps in the process?”

- Refocus the class. Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- To integrate an organic opportunity to practice paraphrasing, invite students to share out their partners’ answers during the Small Group Discussion of Closing and Assessment A. Since students are accustomed to sharing out their own answer, explain why this is helpful and provide them with frames and a model first: “My partner (or name of student) said \_\_\_\_\_.” Challenge them to use their own words while still faithfully representing the ideas of their partners.

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
