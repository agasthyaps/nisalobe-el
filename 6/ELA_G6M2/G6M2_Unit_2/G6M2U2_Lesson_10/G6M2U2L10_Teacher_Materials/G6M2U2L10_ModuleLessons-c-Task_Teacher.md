<td><p><strong>Bridges to Prosperity: Connecting Communities with Vital Services</strong></p>
<p>In the remote parts of countries like Rwanda, Peru and Nicaragua, walking is the primary form of transportation and many people have to walk much further than they need to get to river crossing points because there aren’t bridges.</p>
<p>Bridges to Prosperity (B2P) not only builds bridges but also teaches communities how to build and maintain these connections to healthcare, education and employment. Its projects span the globe, bringing people together through construction training. In total, the organisation has completed 203 bridges in 20 countries and 65,000 return trips are made every day.</p></td>
<td><strong>Answers will vary. Sample response: Bridges to Prosperity has helped people worldwide in 20 different countries.</strong></td>

<td><p><strong>Pedestrian-Focused Infrastructure</strong></p>
<p>Walking is the primary means of travel in most rural parts of the developing world. Crossing rivers on foot to get to schools, clinics, jobs and markets is often hazardous, and communities can be isolated for weeks by a flooded river. Despite the fact that globally, one in seven people travels entirely on foot, most government transportation planning focuses on infrastructure for motor vehicles, and not pedestrians.</p>
<p>The organisation developed an innovative approach, partnering with governments and communities to provide footbridges at sites where there is local demand and the potential for significant social impact.</p>
<p>Suspended and suspension footbridges are built to B2P’s standard designs by teams of local volunteers and labourers, who work with professional volunteers from world-class engineering companies. Local materials are used for the foundations and bridge deck, and repurposed steel for the structural components. A group of community members is trained to maintain the bridge.</p></td>
<td><strong>Answers will vary. Sample response: Rural isolation is a bigger problem than people may realize; 14% of the world’s population travels everywhere only on foot.</strong></td>

<td><p><strong>Impact</strong></p>
<p>The 203 footbridges constructed to date by B2P serve rural communities totalling nearly one million people and about 65,000 return trips are made each day.</p>
<p>The impact of a footbridge on individuals and communities can be enormous. Multi-year monitoring of footbridge programmes in Nepal found that, among the population served by a new footbridge, 12% more children enroll in school and there is a 24% increase in healthcare treatment, an 18% increase in women employed, and a 15% increase in local business.</p></td>

Sample response: New footbridges have had an enormous impact on the communities, such as “12% more children enroll in school and there is a 24% increase in healthcare treatment, an 18% increase in women employed, and a 15% increase in local business” (Ashden).</strong></td>
