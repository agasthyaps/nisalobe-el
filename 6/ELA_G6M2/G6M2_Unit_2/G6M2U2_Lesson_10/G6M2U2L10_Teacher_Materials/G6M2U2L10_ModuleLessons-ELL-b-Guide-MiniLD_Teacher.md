5-Minute Mini Language Dive

SL.6.1, L.6.1

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

However, **I did become homesick,** and whenever that happened, I’d hide away in the school library, where the books filled rows and rows of shelves. (from pages 256–257 of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* by William Kamkwamba and Bryan Mealer)

**Lesson 3 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after students read the chapter 14 excerpt of *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* in Work Time A.

**Rationale**

- Guiding Question and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the guiding question (what habits of character can help solve a critical problem to contribute to a better community?) by illustrating the way in which William shows compassion to himself when he is feeling low and L.6.1 and by demonstrating the way that small variations in grammatical form impact meaning or change emphasis.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses an auxiliary verb + base verb form (**did become**) to emphasize the narrator’s statement.

- Transfer: Past tense auxiliary verb **did** + base form of a verb = to more precisely describe relationships across ideas in students’ writing in Unit 3.

- Note: The sentence also highlights a feeling of homesickness, which may be especially resonant with ELLs who have moved from other parts of the world or country.

**Deconstruct**

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **However, <u>I did become homesick,</u> and whenever that happened, I’d hide away in the school library, where the books filled rows and rows of shelves.**

- Say:

“What does this sentence mean to you?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **I did become homesick,**

- Say:

“What does it mean to feel homesick?” (It means to feel sad because you are away from your family or home.)

“Why does William feel homesick in this chapter?” (He has begun to attend Madisi, a boarding school an hour away from his home.)

- Consider inviting students to reflect on times when they felt homesick, though be careful not to provoke negative feelings in students.

- Draw students’ attention to the words **did become**.

“Is this written in the present or past tense? How do you know?” (Past tense; the verb did is past tense.)

“What do you notice about the way this is written?” (The authors used the auxiliary verb did.)

“How else could the authors have indicated that this action took place in the past?”  
(By writing became instead of did become.)

“Why do you think the authors chose not to say became?” (Responses will vary. Allow students to grapple.)

- If students are struggling to understand the difference between *became* and **did become**, consider providing examples of sentences that use **did** + verb and invite students to deduce a general rule for this structure from the examples. Some examples may include the following:

- I don’t usually celebrate Christmas. However, I did go to a Christmas concert last year.

- I didn’t really like the movie. However, I did think the ending was funny.

- I didn’t ever meet him, but I did know his sister.

- Ultimately, guide them to recognize that using an auxiliary plus an infinitive form of a verb is often done to emphasize a statement, especially a statement that contradicts something said earlier.

**Reconstruct**

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **However, I <u>did become homesick,</u> and whenever that happened, I’d hide away in the school library, where the books filled rows and rows of shelves.**

- Say:

“Where does William go when he feels homesick? What does he do there? You can reread the first paragraph on page 257 if you don’t remember.” (He goes to the library and studies his lessons. He reads about American and African history and studies maps.)

“By going to the library when he feels homesick, what habits of character does William demonstrate?” (Responses will vary, but may include the following: he demonstrates initiative by looking for a way to feel better; he demonstrates compassion for <u>himself</u> by taking care of his emotional needs).

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

**Practice**

- Display the following sentence frames:

> **I don’t usually \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ .**
>
> verb phrase
>
> **However, I did \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ .**
>
> verb phrase
>
> **(However** + subject + auxiliary verb + verb phrase)

- Say:

“Write a sentence describing an action that took place in the place that was surprising because it is different from the things you normally do or feel. Use the auxiliary verb did plus the base form of a verb to emphasize that your action was unusual.”

- Sample response:

> **I don’t usually <u>dance in public.</u> However, I did <u>do ballet in the school talent show last year.</u>**
