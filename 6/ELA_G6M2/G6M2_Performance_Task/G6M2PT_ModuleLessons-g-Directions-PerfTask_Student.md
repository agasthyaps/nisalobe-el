Solution Symposium Presentation Steps

**Name:** **Date:**

1.  First, welcome your guests, introduce yourself, and describe the problem you researched. The top of your visual should cover the solution underneath.

2.  Ask the guests to guess one or two possible solutions to the problem.

3.  Flip down the top layer (the problem) of the visual to reveal the bottom layer (the solution). Explain the solution to the guest.

4.  Listen respectfully as the guest asks the Presentation Prompts: (1) how was design thinking used to solve this problem and (2) how were habits of character used to solve this problem? Answer the questions one at a time.

5.  Offer each guest a sticky note on which to record their favorite insight they learned from your presentation. Thank your guests as they leave the sticky note with you and move on to the next station. Get ready for your next guest, and the process starts again!
