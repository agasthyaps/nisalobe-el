<td>What specific information did you get from the visual about the problem?</td>
<td>The image showed an elderly person wandering in the street. This shows how vulnerable people with Alzheimer’s can be. It made clear how devastating it is when an adult cannot take care of him/herself anymore.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>Design Solution</strong></p>
<p>Explain the solution in a few words.</p></td>
<td>Pressure monitor in sock of Alzheimer’s patient that sends a notification to the caregiver’s smartphone. The notification lets the caregiver know that the patient’s foot is on the floor and the patient may be planning to leave their bed. This gives the caregiver a chance to check on them and make sure they do not wander.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>What specific information did you get from the visual about the solution?</td>
<td>The visual showed the actual device. I couldn’t picture it before. The image makes clear that it’s a very small device that can be easily and comfortably attached to the sock.</td>
