Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.6.2 – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they note two needed revisions that would make their informative essays more effective.

- W.6.5 – Work Time A: Students receive support from their peers through a peer critique of their problem-solution essays.

- SL.6.1 – Work Time A: Students engage in a collaborative discussion with classmates during a peer critique.

- W.6.2 – Work Time B: Students revise their problem-solution essays from the mid-unit assessment.

- W.6.5 – Work Time B: Students develop and strengthen their writing by applying peer feedback when revising their essays.

- Continue to reinforce the habits of character introduced in Unit 1, particularly as students give and receive peer critique.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Select trustworthy students to model a peer critique before expecting students to do this work independently. Alternatively, as a class, watch an EL video demonstrating the Peer Critique protocol and outlining the benefits (http://eled.org/0105).

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students completed the mid-unit assessment, in which they composed a problem-solution essay using the information from their research. Students will have one more opportunity to revise their work in this lesson as they incorporate peer feedback.

Support All Students

- Much of this lesson is discussion-based, so students who struggle with oral language and/or auditory processing may need additional support. Provide sentence frames for students to refer to during discussions or a note-taking template for students to take notes during discussion. ▲

- Think about strategic grouping during the peer critique. Mixed-proficiency groups may still be helpful. Alternative options are having students interact (1) in home language groups if the task is particularly challenging or (2) in homogeneous proficiency groups to promote English language development through grappling. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson offers built-in class time for students to give and receive feedback on the problem-solution essays that they wrote for the mid-unit assessment of the previous lessons. Students are not expected to offer global feedback on their partners’ essays; rather, feedback criteria focus specifically on the writer’s sentence variety and use of appropriate transitions. This limited criteria supports ELLs by honing attention and reducing cognitive overload. Students then have a chance to immediately apply feedback to their own work and revise their essays.

- ELLs may find it challenging to address the feedback provided by their partners, especially if they struggle in general with varying the style or structure of their sentences or with using transitions to improve cohesion. As needed, be available to students to answer questions and help them determine next steps before revising their essays during Work Time B.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.C.10, 6.II.A.2, 6.II.B.5, 6.II.C.6, and 6.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- Use the Speaking and Listening Informal Assessment: Collaborative Discussion checklist during the Peer Critique in Work Time B.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will use the information from their revised essays to begin working on the Module 2 Performance Task. They will analyze a model and, having demonstrated considerable knowledge of their topic, plan their visual for their own performance task. Students will also share their progress on their independent research reading task. Refer to the Independent Reading: Sample Plans to guide students through a research reading share, or use another routine.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.6.2 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 10**. Students will need to reference the **Informative Writing checklist**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Peer Critique: Problem-Solution Essay – W.6.5 (20 minutes)

- Explain that today students will give and receive feedback about their **Problem-Solution Essay** from the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment. They will help each other take the first drafts and make them into high-quality work pieces.

- Focus students on the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart** and remind them specifically of respect and compassion. Remind students that the purpose of peer feedback is to help the other student improve his or her work, so when we provide feedback, we have to be careful to ensure we are respectful and compassionate.

- Remind students that peer critique is not about telling someone how bad his or her work is—it is about celebrating the good things about the work and helping to make it even better.

- Display and refocus students on their Informative Writing checklist.

- Focus students on the criteria:

“W.6.2c: I use appropriate transitions to show how ideas and information connect.”

“L.6.3b: I use different types of sentences to make meaning clear and interest the reader.”

- Invite students to mark or highlight these criteria, as they will be the focus of the critique.

- Move students into pairs and invite them to label themselves A and B.

- Distribute **sticky notes**. Remind students that this is where they will record stars and steps for their partner.

- Focus students on the **Work to Contribute to a Better World anchor chart**, specifically “use my strengths.” Remind students that because they will be working to give a critique to their partner, they will need to use their strengths to help their partner grow.

- Tell students they will peer critique to provide their partner with kind, specific, and helpful feedback using the criteria on the checklist. Remind them to use the **Directions for Peer Critique** and **Peer Critique Protocol anchor chart**.

- Circulate to support students as they give feedback to one another. Emphasize that students should not make revisions yet. As needed, cue students to seek to deepen their thinking as they provide feedback:

“Why do you think that? What, in the essay, makes you think so?”

- Invite students to reflect on their progress towards the relevant learning target, using a checking for understanding technique. Scan student responses and make a note of students who might need support to check in with them moving forward.

For Lighter Support

- Before Work Time A, invite students who need lighter support to compile a list of words and phrases that writers can use to signal transitions in their essays. Challenge students to distinguish these transitional words and phrases according to their function (e.g., *additionally*, *also* —to add information; *however*, *whereas*, *on the other hand* —to show contrast). Display these transitional phrases for all students to refer to while providing feedback.

For Heavier Support

- If feasible, before Work Time A, encourage students to revisit the Practice sections of the Language Dives of Module 1, Unit 2, Lesson 14; Module 2, Unit 2, Lesson 12; and Module 2, Unit 3, Lesson 4. These Language Dives helped students learn to incorporate transitions to connect ideas and vary sentence pattern to clarify meaning and increase reader interest.

- For added support during Work Time A, pair students who speak the same home language. Allow them to use their home languages as a resource to help them interpret their partners’ essays and ask clarifying questions.

Work Time

B. Revise Problem-Solution Essay – W.6.2 (15 minutes)

- Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart** and remind them of initiative and responsibility as they revise their work.

- Invite students to revise their writing using the peer feedback they were given. Circulate to support students as they revise their work.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Closing and Assessment

A. Review Performance Task (5 minutes)

- Distribute and display the **Performance Task: Solution Symposium** and explain the different components to the task: the flip-down visual, presentation prompts, and series of events during each presentation. Refer to **Performance Task Overview**.

- Focus students on the displayed **Performance Task anchor chart**. Remind students what the performance task asks of them since it has been a while since they first discussed it at the start of Unit 1. Field questions and offer clarification, reminding students that they will work on each piece one at a time over the next several lessons.

- Explain that in the next lesson they will analyze a model visual and presentation and start creating their own materials.

Homework

A. Review Independent Research Reading Journal

- Students review their **independent reading journal** entries in preparation for the Independent Reading Research Share in the next lesson.
