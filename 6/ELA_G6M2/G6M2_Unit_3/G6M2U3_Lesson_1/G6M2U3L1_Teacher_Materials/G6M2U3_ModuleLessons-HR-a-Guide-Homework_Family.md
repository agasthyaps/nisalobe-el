![](media/image1.png) Guiding Questions and Big Ideas

How can design thinking help solve a critical problem?

- *Design thinking is a scientific and systematic practice of inquiry that allows for creativity and innovation.*

- *Design thinking requires scientists to identify and research problems, build prototypes, test and evaluate solutions, and redesign as needed.*

What habits of character can help solve a critical problem to contribute to a better community?

- *Effective learners demonstrate perseverance when they research, build prototypes, reflect, and revise.*

- *Ethical people contribute to a better world by applying their learning to help one’s school, community, and the environment.*

What will your student be doing at school?

In Unit 3, students practice the Painted Essay® structure, which assists students in understanding the key parts of an informational essay. Students first work with a peer to plan and draft an informational essay on a different topic following the same structure. By working collaboratively, students have the opportunity to discuss and more deeply consider the design thinking process and how it might be explained in writing. Student collaboration gives a greater chance to explore how William used this process to solve a problem because students are exposed to the ideas and contributions of a peer. Students use their learning about informational writing and problem-solution structure, as well as their research from Unit 2, to independently plan and write an essay about the innovator from their chosen TED Talk.

The unit builds towards the culminating performance task, a Solution Symposium. During the Solution Symposium, students synthesize and showcase their learning. This task requires students to craft carefully selected visuals of only the most relevant information for a display, then prepare and rehearse their responses to prompts that will be provided to the audience members. Rather than a traditional presentation, the Solution Symposium becomes interactive, encouraging a back and forth dialogue between the researcher (your student) and the audience (fellow peers, teachers, and community members such as yourself). Specifically, students will connect their learning from the module and important life skills to their research by preparing to answer two key questions: 1) How was design thinking used to solve this problem?, and 2) How were habits of character used to solve this problem? Students will discover that sharing the story of these modern innovators can inspire others to try to solve problems that will benefit their own community. To debrief the Solution Symposium, the class will participate in a discussion about how habits of character, such as collaboration, initiative, and compassion, help people to solve critical problems.

How can you support your student at home?

Watch or read local and global news with your student and identify critical problems. Discuss what makes the problem critical and consider different design solutions that could help solve some of these local and/or global problems.

Consider with your student different design solutions that can be created to handle chores around the house.

Take apart an object in your home with your student. Work together to put the object back together and discuss how each piece helps the object to function.

Play logic-based games with your student that requires him/her to apply evidence in order to reach a logic-based conclusion.

Read your student’s independent research reading text at the same time as him/her. Consider asking these questions:

- How does the key individual in the text use design thinking to solve a problem?

- What stages of the design thinking process can you identify in the text?

- Is the design thinking process in the text linear? Why? Why not?

- What type of research does the key individual of the text engage in while designing the solution to the problem?

- How did the innovator rely on reading to help develop the solution?

Help your student to prepare for the Solution Symposium by asking questions about the innovative designer, the critical problem he/she solved, and how design thinking was used to produce a solution.

Help your student to prepare for the Solution Symposium by listening to the presentation and providing kind, specific feedback on your student’s voice volume, speech speed, and eye contact.

Unit 3: Homework

Homework throughout Unit 3 focuses on students concluding their independent research reading. Students participate in an Independent Research Reading Share during Lesson 11.

Homework for Lessons 2 and 7 focuses on students completing writing planners that prepare them for in class writing tasks.

Homework for Lessons 11–13 focuses on students preparing for the Solution Symposium in Lesson 14.

**Independent Research reading:** Your student is expected to independently research the topic of study in this module, Critical Problems and Design Solutions, by reading topic-related books of his or her choice. Research reading will be assigned on evenings when students are not already reading the anchor text. Students will be expected to read for approximately 20 minutes each day and respond to a prompt of choice in the front of the independent reading journal.

**Choice reading:** If your student would also like to independently read and respond to a book of free choice, he or she may use the back of the independent reading journal.

Independent Reading

**Directions:** Remember to record responses to research reading in the front of your independent reading journal and responses to choice reading in the back. Try to choose a different prompt each time.

Record any new vocabulary in your vocabulary log. Underline vocabulary found during independent reading.

**Record:**

- Date

- Title and author of your reading book

- Pages you have read

- Prompt

- Response

**Example:**

<u>Date:</u> November 14

<u>Book Title and Author:</u> *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* (Young Readers Edition) by William Kamkwamba and Bryan Mealer

<u>Pages Read:</u> 114–127

<u>Prompt:</u> Explain a way in which you connect to the text.

<u>Response:</u> Khamba is dying, and based on the suggestions from Charity, William decides to leave Khamba in the woods to pass away peacefully. My family had a dog, Maxwell, for fifteen years. Towards Maxwell’s final days, he could not get up and walk. Maxwell did not eat. My sister and brother tried to pick Maxwell up in order to put him in the car and take him to the vet to be put to sleep and end his pain. Maxwell surprised everybody by biting my sister and brother. Maxwell did not bite. He was gentle and playful. One morning, my mom went to check on Maxwell and he had passed away. We were devastated. We knew the time was coming, but Maxwell was so dear to the family. When talking about Maxwell and his uncharacteristic moment of vicious biting, we muse that Maxwell knew where my sister and brother were trying to take him, but Maxwell wanted to be at home. My family’s situation with Maxwell makes me question William’s decision: Did William really leave Khamba in the forest for Khamba’s benefit or for his own? Maxwell wanted to pass away at home, and from the way Khamba looked at William as William walked away, I’m sure Khamba would have preferred the same.

**Consider using the following independent reading prompts.**[^1]

- How does this text add to your understanding of one of the guiding questions of the module?

- Which habits of character are demonstrated in the text? Explain.

- Which habits of character are NOT demonstrated in the text? Explain.

- Record two or three facts in your own words that you learned from the text.

- Summarize your research reading today in no more than five sentences.

- Explain the critical problem an individual in the text experiences.

- How does an individual in the text demonstrate design thinking?

- Explain how you connect to the text.

- Explain how the text connects to another text you’ve read.

- Explain how the text connects to something currently happening in the world.

- How is the design thinking process in the text similar to William’s process in *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* (Young Readers Edition)?

- How does the design thinking process in the text differ from William’s process in *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind* (Young Readers Edition)?

- Choose one new word from your reading today and analyze it on a vocabulary square.

|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Definition in your own words**                  | **Synonyms** (words with the same meaning) |
| **Words with the same affix or root**             | **Sketch**                                 |

Vocabulary

**Directions:** In the classroom, you have been recording words from your texts in your vocabulary log. Throughout this unit, you have been research reading topic-related books at home to build your knowledge of critical problems and design solutions and recording words in your independent reading journal.

Choose a word from your research reading or from a text you’ve read in class and add the word to your vocabulary log. Try to choose a different word to add and to practice a different vocabulary strategy each time. For each word, be sure to add the following:

1.  The definition, or meaning, of the word

<!-- -->

4.  The vocabulary strategy you used to figure out the meaning of the word

5.  A sketch or diagram that helps you to better understand the meaning of the word

Record new vocabulary in vocabulary logs and mark academic vocabulary with a symbol, for example a star:

- Academic vocabulary: words you might find in informational texts on many different topics. For example, the words *evidence* and *rationale* are words that could be found in books on any topic.

- Domain-specific vocabulary: words about a particular topic. For example, the words *dynamos, generators,* and *breaker* are some that would be found on the topic of electricity.

**Vocabulary Strategies**

As a reminder, the following are the vocabulary strategies we’ve been working on in class:

- Context: Read the sentence around the word.

- Look at the affixes for clues.

- Look at the root of the word for clues.

- Use a dictionary.

- Discuss the word with another person (after attempting some of the above strategies).

[^1]: Some of the prompts will not be appropriate for the text students are reading. Invite students to choose a prompt that works for the text they have just read.
