English Language Learners: Grade 6: Module 2: Unit 3: Teaching Notes

Write to Inform: Problem-Solution Essay

Teaching Notes for Unit 3

Prioritize Lessons for Classrooms with Many English Language Learners

To prepare for the mid-unit assessment, consider prioritizing and expanding instruction in Lesson 1, in which students use the familiar Painted Essay® structure to analyze the function of individual sentences and paragraphs in the Model Problem-Solution Essay: “Bridges to Prosperity”; and Lesson 7, in which students plan the independent problem-solution essays that they will write during the mid-unit assessment of the following lessons. The Language Dives of Lesson 4 and 6 are also especially critical for ELLs, as they hone student attention to recyclable structures within a problem-solution text. Finally, prioritize Lesson 13, which offers students valuable time to rehearse their performance task presentations. ELLs, especially, may benefit from additional time to polish and refine their oral presentations before the Solution Symposium of Lesson 14 and the text-based discussion of Lesson 15.

Language Dives

In Lessons 4 and 6, students participate in Language Dives that use sentences from the Model Problem-Solution Essay: “Bridges to Prosperity.” In Lesson 4, students examine a key sentence from Proof Paragraph 1 of the model essay, investigating the ways in which the sentence supports a transition from a description of a problem to a description of its solution. In Lesson 6, students analyze a sentence from the conclusion of the model essay, which uses a prepositional phrase and gerund (*By* verb+*ing*, \_\_\_) to elaborate on the means with which something is achieved. Both Language Dives offer useful structures that students can adapt and incorporate directly into their collaborative and independent problem-solution essays. Opportunities for extended practice with these sentences are available in Lessons 4 and 6 of this guide.

A Language Dive empowers students to analyze, understand, and use the language of academic sentences, which often seems opaque to students. During a Language Dive, students slow down for 10 to 20 minutes to have a conversation about the meaning, purpose, and structure of a compelling sentence from a complex text, or from a learning target, checklist, or rubric included in the curriculum. Following the engaging deconstruct-reconstruct-practice routine of the Language Dive, students play with the smallest “chunks” of the sentence, interpreting them, rearranging them, or using them to talk about their own lives. As a result of paying close attention to how language works, all students begin to acquire the necessary facility with academic English, and ELLs foster their overall language ability. A consistent Language Dive routine is critical in helping all students learn how to decipher complex sentences and write their own.

Most Language Dives implicitly address a wide range of Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening, and Language standards. Once comfortable with Language Dives, consider supplementing the focus standards in a particular Language Dive with additional standards to meet students’ needs. Note that the Rationale section of each Language Dive also identifies supporting standards that are explicitly addressed but are not the main focus of the Language Dive.

Note that the Language Dive guides have been condensed in Module 2, as a way to reduce the amount of reading expected of teachers. Refer to the general best practices laid out in the Module 1 Language Dive guides.

Mini Language Dives

Students continue to have the option to participate in Mini Language Dives in Unit 3. Mini Language Dives have the same overall purpose and follow the same general process as full Language Dives, but are condensed to 5 minutes, narrowing students’ attention on deconstructing the focus structure, reconstructing the sentence, and practicing the focus structure. Mini Language Dives give ELLs additional support in building language and literacy skills, as well as habits of mind. Mini Language Dives are most often optional and can be found in the corresponding lessons within this guide. When required for all students, Mini Language Dives are built into the body of the lesson in the Teacher Guide. In this unit, optional Mini Language Dives appear in Lessons 3 and 5.

Diversity and Inclusion

Investigate the routines, practices, rituals, beliefs, norms, and experiences that are important to ELLs and their families. Integrate this background into the classroom as students engage with texts. Consider the values and narratives embedded in class texts and try to anticipate their relevance to ELLs. Create a supportive and inclusive classroom environment by reminding students that everyone is working toward improvement. Be sure to highlight and praise growth and development rather than relative performance. Check in with students at strategic points during the unit and invite students to connect their personal experiences to their topic. Consult with a guidance counselor, school social worker, or ESL teacher for further investigation of diversity and inclusion.

Conversation Cues

Encourage productive and equitable conversation with Conversation Cues, which are questions to ask students that help achieve four goals:

- (Goal 1) encourage all students to talk and be understood;

- (Goal 2) listen carefully to one another and seek to understand;

- (Goal 3) deepen thinking; and

- (Goal 4) think with others to expand the conversation (adapted from Michaels, Sarah, and Cathy O’Connor. *Talk Science Primer*. TERC, 2012. http://inquiryproject.terc.edu/shared/pd/TalkScience_Primer.pdf. Based on Chapin, S., O’Connor, C., and N. Anderson. \[2009\]. *Classroom Discussions: Using Math Talk to Help Students Learn, Grades K–6.* Second Edition. Math Solutions Publications).

Refer to the Tools Page (http://eled.org/tools) for the complete set of cues. Goal 1 Conversation Cues were introduced in Module 1, Unit 1; Goal 2 Conversation Cues were introduced in Module 1, Unit 3; and Goal 3 Conversation Cues were introduced in Module 2, Unit 2. All will continue to be used throughout this module, and suggestions for integrating Conversation Cues into instruction are presented across lessons. For ELLs, Conversation Cues are especially critical because they improve language processing abilities and increase engagement and participation.

Strategic Grouping

As much as possible, facilitate opportunities in class for groups to discuss and complete content and tasks. Vary these groups so that ELLs have opportunities to interact with a wide variety of speakers in different situations, thus expanding the opportunity for language development. For particularly challenging tasks, such as the collaborative problem-solution essay, which students plan and write across Lessons 2–6, think about strategically grouping ELLs with native and proficient English speakers. For more manageable tasks, interacting in homogeneous proficiency groups may promote English language development through grappling. At times, grouping speakers of the same home language may facilitate development of home language in association with content, boosting students’ connectedness to in-class material.

Performance Task

In Lesson 14, students participate in a performance task, which is designed to celebrate and highlight their learning over the course of the module. In this module, the performance task is a Solution Symposium, in which students develop short, interactive presentations about their independent research into an innovator and the critical problem that he or she solved using design thinking. ELLs may feel intimidated by the performance task, especially if they feel nervous about their speaking skills. The nature of the Solution Symposium, however, requires that students deliver the same short presentation multiple times as new audience members visit their station and ask familiar, preselected questions. Help students recognize that the scaffolding and repetition built into this performance task allows for practice, preparation, and improvement. Remind students, too, that the performance task is not formally assessed; rather, it is an opportunity for students to share and celebrate their and their classmates’ work and imagination.

Differentiated Materials

Differentiated materials are available for ELLs and other students who would benefit from an increased level of support. These resources have been modified for the purposes of creating accessibility to content and concepts and supporting language development. Depending upon the task being carried out with a material, images, selected response options, answer banks, sentence frames, or model responses have been embedded to guide students’ thinking without compromising a focus on standards and the skills that students are developing and applying to meet them.

Celebration

Celebrate the courage, enthusiasm, diversity, and bilingual assets that ELLs bring to the classroom. Additionally, students can celebrate their successful attempts at communication and their ability to extend and enhance the discussions.
