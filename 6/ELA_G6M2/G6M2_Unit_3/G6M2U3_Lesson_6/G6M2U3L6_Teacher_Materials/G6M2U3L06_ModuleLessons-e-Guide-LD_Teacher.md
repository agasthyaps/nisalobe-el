Language Dive Guide: Model Problem-Solution Essay: “Bridges to Prosperity,” Conclusion

RI.6.1, W.6.2f, SL.6.1, L.6.5

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

By “connecting the rural last mile to the rest of the world,” **B2P uses design thinking to have a profound impact** on the lives of 1 million people (*Bridges to Prosperity*). (from the conclusion paragraph of the Model Problem-Solution Essay)

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the Daily Learning Target **(I can analyze the structure of the model essay conclusion)** and W.6.2f by serving as an example of an effective concluding statement that summarizes the impact of B2P’s solution to a critical problem. Supporting Standards: RI.6.1, SL.6.1, L.6.5.

- Guiding Question: The sentence helps students respond to the guiding question **(how can design thinking help solve a critical problem?)** by offering a specific example of an impactful solution born out of design thinking.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses a practical structure (\[noun phrase\] **uses** \[noun phrase\] **to** \[verb phrase\]) to show the relationship between design thinking and its impact. Also, the sentence serves as an example of an effective quotation and follows standard conventions for source attribution by including a citation for the quoted information in parentheses: **(*Bridges to Prosperity*)**. Invite students to discuss each chunk briefly, but encourage extended conversation and practice with the focus structure: **B2P uses design thinking to have a profound impact**. Based on student need and time, consider adding days for extended conversation and practice with a new focus structure: **By “connecting the rural last mile to the rest of the world,”**. Lesson 6 of the Teacher’s Guide for English Language Learners describes an extension activity based on this alternative focus structure.

- Practice and Transfer: After discussing the focus structure, students practice using it to discuss something in their lives. Students transfer their understanding of the meaning and structure of this sentence when writing the conclusion paragraphs of their problem-solution essays during the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment.

Launch

- Display the following three criteria for this type of concluding sentence:

1.  Describe something that an innovator did.

2.  Name the innovator.

3.  Explain the result of the innovator’s design thinking.

- Say:

“During this Language Dive, we are going to discuss how a writer included three important criteria to create a strong concluding sentence. Let’s look for these criteria as we deconstruct.”

Deconstruct

- Invite students to put their finger by this sentence from the conclusion paragraph of the Model Problem-Solution Essay: “Bridges to Prosperity” on their note-catchers: **By “connecting the rural last mile to the rest of the world,” <u>B2P uses design thinking to have a profound impact</u> on the lives of 1 million people (*Bridges to Prosperity*).**

- Read aloud the sentence twice, and then ask students to take turns reading aloud the sentence with their partners.

- Say:

“What does this sentence mean to you?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“How does this sentence add to your understanding of the guiding question ‘how can design thinking help solve a critical problem?’” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

B2P uses design thinking to have a  
profound impact

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **B2P uses design thinking to have a profound impact**

- Say:

“What does this chunk tell us?” (Responses may vary.)

- Underline the noun phrase a profound impact in blue and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 

“What is another way to say profound impact?” (Great effect, strong influence.)

“In this chunk, what is the relationship between design thinking and a profound impact?” (Design thinking led to the profound impact; the profound impact was the result of design thinking.)

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Display the sentence frame:

**I use my education to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use this frame to talk about something that your education leads to. Use your own words with your partners.”

on the lives of 1 million people

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following sentence chunk strip: **on the lives of 1 million people**

- Say:

“What does this chunk tell us?” (Responses may vary.)

“How might design thinking lead to a profound impact on the lives of 1 million people?” (Design thinking helps us develop innovative, effective solutions to solve the critical problems felt by many people.)

“How might this chunk relate to the idea of a critical problem and its solution?” (Responses may vary, but look for students to notice that this chunk refers to a huge number of people. Problems that affect many people may be considered more critical.)

By “connecting the rural last mile to the  
rest of the world,”

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **By “connecting the rural last mile to the rest of the world,”**

- Underline the noun phrase the rural last mile in blue and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 

- Say:

“What does the phrase the rural last mile mean to you?” (Responses may vary. Note that this phrase is used like a slogan in many publications by Bridges to Prosperity. As needed, help students break down each part of the noun phrase. Guide them to understand that this phrase refers to remote areas, far away from the city, which are the last areas to have reliable access to urban areas.)

“How did Bridges to Prosperity connect rural areas to the rest of the world?” (By building bridges that helped people in remote areas cross rivers and access the things they need.)

- If time allows, invite students to sketch a bridge that connects a rural area to the rest of the world on their note-catchers. 

- Underline By in green, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 

“What is the relationship between the word By and the rest of this chunk?” (By introduces the action—connecting the rural mile to the rest of the world—that tells us about the impact of design thinking; the dependent clause that begins with by functions as the cause in a cause-and-effect relationship.)

- Note that this relationship may be a challenging one for students to understand. Lesson 6 of the Teacher’s Guide for English Language Learners describes an extension to this Language Dive that focuses on this **by** + verb **-ing** structure.

- Say:

“This chunk demonstrates another important criteria for writing this type of conclusion sentence: describing something an innovator has done.”

- Draw student attention to the quotation marks within the chunk.

- Say:

“What do these quotation marks tell us? Why is the word By not included within the quotation marks?” (The quotation marks tell us that this is a direct quote. The word By was added to support the sentence grammatically, but it was not in the original model essay.)

“If we directly quote someone else’s words, what other information must we include?”  
(We must include a citation that explains where that information comes from.)

(*Bridges to Prosperity*).

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **(*Bridges to Prosperity*).**

- Say:

“What does this chunk tell us?” (This chunk tells us the source of the previous quote.)

“Why is it important to include this information?” (It is important because we want to avoid plagiarism and make sure that people get credit for their ideas.)

By “connecting the rural last mile to the rest of the world,” B2P uses design thinking to have a profound impact on the lives of 1 million people (*Bridges to Prosperity*).

Reconstruct

- Point to and read the entire sentence on display: **By “connecting the rural last mile to the rest of the world,” <u>B2P uses design thinking to have a profound impact</u> on the lives of 1 million people (*Bridges to Prosperity*).**

- Say:

“Who is responsible for connecting the rural last mile to the rest of the world?” (B2P and the communities they work with.)

- If productive, help students notice that B2P is the first noun that comes after the comma following the dependent clause “By ‘connecting the rural last mile to the rest of the world.’”  
  This signals to the reader that B2P is responsible for the action of the dependent clause.

“What if we removed the clause By “connecting the rural last mile to the rest of the world,”? (The sentence would be grammatically correct, though it would be less specific.  
It would no longer provide an example of how B2P used design thinking to have a profound impact.)

“Where else in the sentence could we move the opening clause?” (It could also go at the end of the sentence: B2P uses design thinking to have a profound impact on the lives of 1 million people by “connecting the rural last mile to the rest of the world.”)

“What other questions can we ask that will help us understand this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question how can design thinking help solve a critical problem?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to notice that this sentence provides a specific example of how design thinking led to an impactful solution.)

“How can we use a similar sentence in our own problem-solution essays?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to understand that a similar sentence could be included in their conclusion paragraphs to synthesize key information in the essay.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

> **By \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ uses design thinking to**
>
> a b
>
> **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ .**
>
> c

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use this frame to talk about the innovator you have researched. This sentence should (a) describe something that your innovator has done, (b) name your innovator, and (c) explain the result of your innovator’s design thinking. Use your own words.”

- Remind students of the displayed a–c criteria from the Launch section of this Language Dive. Encourage students to refer to those criteria as they complete their sentence frames.

- After one minute, invite and display student responses. Encourage students to refine these sentences and use them in the conclusion paragraphs of their essays during the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment.
