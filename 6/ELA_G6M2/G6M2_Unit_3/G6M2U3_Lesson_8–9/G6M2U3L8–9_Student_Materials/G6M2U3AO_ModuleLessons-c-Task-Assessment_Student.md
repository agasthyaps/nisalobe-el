You have worked with a partner to draft a problem-solution essay about how William used design thinking to build his windmill. Also, you conducted research about a subject of your choosing and planned your own problem-solution essay to convey the results of your research. Remember that the research and the essay answer the research question **how was design thinking used to solve this critical problem?**

In this two-day assessment, you will now draft the full essay.
