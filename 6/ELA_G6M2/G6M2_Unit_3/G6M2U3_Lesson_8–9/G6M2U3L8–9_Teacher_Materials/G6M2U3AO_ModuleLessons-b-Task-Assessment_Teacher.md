Imagine that a raging river separated you from your school, the hospital, or drinkable water. Now imagine that there was no way to safely cross that river. In 2001, a photo in *National Geographic* magazine showed a group of men struggling to pull each other over the Blue Nile River using ropes. The bridge had been damaged. The ropes were the only way to get across. Ken Frantz, who owned a construction company, saw that photo. He decided he could fix that bridge. So, he founded Bridges to Prosperity (B2P) to do just that. A few years later, an engineering student named Avery Bang saw a similar dangerous situation and was inspired to do something. Avery Bang is now the president of Bridges to Prosperity. B2P builds footbridges that connect people with the resources they need. Helping rural communities access resources and services is a complex problem. Using design thinking, B2P is able to solve it.

**The Problem**

The problem for many isolated communities is that rivers separate them from schools, jobs, markets, and health services. Often there is no safe way to cross these rivers. Many people risk their own safety to try to cross in any way they can. This is a critical problem because one in seven people cannot safely access the services and products they need to survive (Bang). Increasing “connectivity” (connecting people to basic resources) is the immediate problem that B2P is working to solve. However, they are also working to solve the larger, related problem of poverty. In the beginning of the design process, B2P works with local people to identify struggling communities. They then research the feasibility and cost of a building a bridge. B2P chooses projects that will have the greatest social impact. They also check to see if there is demand from the community and a commitment to help in the process (“Bridges to Prosperity”). In this way, B2P demonstrates the first steps in design thinking. They ask questions and research to better understand the problem and to get ideas for solutions.

W.6.2a: Clear, logical progression of ideas from beginning to end with strong connections between and among ideas. This paragraph links to the second part of the focus statement about problem.

W.6.2a: This paragraphs links to the first part of the focus statement about the use of design thinking to find a solution.

W.6.2c: Uses appropriate transitions to create cohesion and clarify the relationships among ideas and concepts.

W.6.4, W.6.2e: Establishes and maintains formal style and objective tone. The word *I* hasn’t been used in the essay. Mostly compound and complex sentences.

W.6.2f: Conclusion follows from and supports information or explanation presented and offers ideas about the impact of the solution and he habits of character evident in this experience.

W.6.8: Provides basic bibliographic information for sources.

**The Solution**

It might seem like solving these problems is simple: build bridges over the rivers. However, the process of imagining, planning, creating, testing, and improving the solution is far from simple. B2P uses design thinking to create bridges specific to the needs of each community. During the “imagine” phase, B2P starts with some standardized bridge plans. All the footbridges are designed to carry pedestrians, bikes, animals, and motorbikes. Each has cable handrails and safety fencing. Each takes about two months to complete. During the “planning” phase, changes to the standardized plans are made. These are based on the land features of the site, the needs of the people, and what local materials and methods are available. Part of this phase is also planning how the project will be paid for. Funding for B2P “is mainly provided through grants and donations from the US and UK, with contributions in both materials and labour from local governments” (“Bridges to Prosperity”). B2P also uses design thinking to solve the smaller problems they face during a project, such as getting the materials to where they need them. As a result, B2P has solved the problem of connectivity by building 270 bridges in 22 countries.

**Using Design Thinking to Build a Better World**

By “connecting the rural last mile to the rest of the world,” B2P uses design thinking to have a profound impact on the lives of 1 million people (*Bridges to Prosperity*). The connectivity and access provided by these bridges help reduce rural poverty. Communities with bridges had an average income over 30% higher than similar communities without bridges. Bridges to Prosperity uses design thinking to contribute to a better world. B2P workers show initiative, responsibility, perseverance, and collaboration as they work together. More importantly, they show empathy, integrity, respect, and compassion for the people they are serving. Design thinking can not only solve problems, it can make us better people in the process!
