Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- L.6.3a – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they combine two simple sentences into a complex sentence without changing the original meaning.

- W.6.2a – Work Time A: Students analyze how ideas are organized in a model problem-solution essay.

- W.6.2b – Work Time A: Students analyze how second Proof Paragraph of the model essay, develops a topic with relevant facts, information, and examples.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time B: Students collaborate to draft the second Proof Paragraph of their problem-solution essays, using textual evidence to support their analysis.

- RI.6.7 – Work Time B: Students integrate information collected from different media to inform the second Proof Paragraphs of their collaborative problem-solution essays.

- W.6.2b – Work Time B: Students collaborate to draft the second Proof Paragraph of their problem-solution essays, developing their topics with relevant information and examples.

- W.6.2c – Work Time B: Students incorporate transitions into the second Proof Paragraphs of their problem-solution essays in order to clarify relationships across ideas.

- W.6.4 – Work Time B: Students produce clear and coherent Proof Paragraphs, organized with attention to task, purpose, and audience.

- W.6.5 – Work Time B: With support from their partners, students develop their writing by producing a collaborative draft of the second Proof Paragraph.

- W.6.8 – Work Time B: Students draft the second Proof Paragraphs of their problem-solution essays, quoting and paraphrasing information they have gathered from multiple sources.

- SL.6.2 – Work Time B: Students collaborate to interpret the information they have collected from diverse media and explain how it contributes to their understanding of a critical problem.

- SL.6.1 – In groups of three or four, students discuss how habits of character were demonstrated in this lesson.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Using a variety of vocabulary strategies, invite students to determine the meaning of the word *standardized* as it is used in the model essay.

- Encourage students to incorporate some of the vocabulary they have collected throughout this module into their essays.

- Allow students to manipulate sentences from the model essay, trying different combinations to make sentences with varying patterns.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Students have been analyzing a model and using their analysis to draft the introduction and Proof Paragraph 1 of a problem-solution essay. This lesson continues those routines to guide students in drafting Proof Paragraph 2.

Support All Students

- Note that there is a differentiated version of the entrance ticket used in Opening A in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- An optional Mini Language Dive, intended for use after students work with the introduction of the Model Problem-Solution Essay in Work Time A. ▲

- A topic involving a problem and a solution allows opportunities for physical engagement. Invite students to act out the problem and solution being described in their essays. Known as embodied cognition, research demonstrates that the body influences the mind just as the mind influences the body.

- To support ELLs, this lesson follows a similar pattern to Lessons 3 and 4 with scaffolded tasks that guide students from analysis to paired writing. The class is first guided through an analysis of Proof Paragraph 2 of the Model Problem-Solution Essay: “Bridges to Prosperity.” Then, they work with their partners to draft Proof Paragraph 2. Discussion protocols are built into the lesson, promoting equitable, meaningful discussion among students, and the Closing of the lesson facilitates an opportunity for students to reflect on their learning, celebrating successes and locating areas of growth.

- ELLs may find it challenging to synthesize in their essays the solution(s) described across an entire novel. Through reading *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, students learned a great deal about William and his approach to the critical problems in his community and determining exactly which details to include in their essays may be challenging. If it is helpful to do so, invite students to briefly put their pencils down and state aloud their understanding of the solution. Students may find that briefly summarizing the solution aloud guides them in locating the most important information to include in their essays.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.4, 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.7, 6.I.C.10, 6.I.C.11, 6.I.C.12, 6.II.A.1, 6.II.A.2, 6.II.B.5, 6.II.C.6, and 6.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- Consider using the Grade 6 Writing Process checklist to assess students’ writing abilities in Work Time B (see the Tools Page at http://eled.org/tools).

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will draft the conclusion of their collaborative essay. For the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment, students will follow the same process to independently plan and write a problem-solution essay about the topic they researched in Unit 2.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.6.3a (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 5** or **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 5** ▲. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 5 (example for teacher reference)** for possible responses.

- Using a total participation technique, ask:

“Why do writers combine simple sentences to make complex sentences as you did on the entrance ticket?” (To vary their sentence structure. To add interest and keep each sentence from sounding repetitive. To make the writing more logical or easier to follow.)

- Explain that, as writing partners continue to draft their collaborative essays, they should be aware of their sentence structure and look for ways to make variations.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

- The entrance tickets of Lessons 4 and 5 feature similar tasks related to sentence variety, which target the critical language standard L.6.3a. Invite students who need lighter support to collaboratively produce a “Separating and Combining Sentences” anchor chart, which can be displayed for all students to use. Spark students’ thinking with examples such as “Sentences that are much shorter or much longer than the sentences around them often get the reader’s attention” and “Change punctuation and capitalization as needed.”

For Heavier Support

- During Opening A, invite students who need heavier support to use the Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 5 ▲. This resource features a sentence frame to help students effectively combine simple sentences to produce a longer, more complex sentence.

Work Time

A. Analyze a Model: Proof Paragraph 2 – W.6.2b (10 minutes)

- Ask students to retrieve their **Model Problem-Solution Model Essay: “Bridges to Prosperity.”**

- Move students into partnerships, grouping students with someone other than their writing partner. Explain that students will follow the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol to analyze the key components of the second Proof Paragraph. Remind students that they will stand back to back with their partner while they listen to and think about the question posed, before turning around to share their responses with their partner. Students should wait for the direction to move into back-to-back or face-to-face position.

- Move students into back-to-back position. Direct students to the second Proof Paragraph by referring to its heading—The Solution. Remind students that headings support the reader in understanding the main idea of each paragraph. Invite students to quietly read the second body paragraph of the model essay to themselves.

- Ask:

“What do you notice about this paragraph?” (It is all focused around the solution. It makes connections to the design thinking process.)

- Allow students think time before directing students to turn around face-to-face.

- Return students back-to-back. Direct students to read the second Proof Paragraph to themselves again, this time leaving out the first three sentences (“It might seem . . . ” through “ . . . of each community.”)

- Ask:

“What if the writer had not included this information? How would that change the reader’s understanding of the topic?” (It would not be clear that the author was transitioning to the description of the solution. The different phases referenced in the paragraph would not make sense without explaining that the innovator followed the design thinking process.)

- Allow students think time before directing students to turn around face-to-face.

- Return students back-to-back. Draw students’ attention to the statement in quotes: “is mainly provided through grants and donations from the US and UK, with contributions in both materials and labour from local governments.”

- Ask:

“Why did the author put this part of the sentence in quotation marks?” (It is a direct quote from the source named in the parentheses.)

“Why might the author have chosen to quote this information?” (To provide evidence to support the author’s point. To demonstrate that the information is reliable and credible. To demonstrate that information was drawn from an outside source, not just the author’s opinion.)

- Allow students think time before directing students to turn around face-to-face.

- Explain that authors often choose to quote directly rather than to paraphrase when they want to preserve the language used in the original source because it is particularly powerful or beautiful.

- Return students back-to-back. Remind students of their work on transition words and phrases from previous modules. Invite pairs to read the second Proof Paragraph to themselves again, this time identifying transition words or phrases.

- Ask:

“What examples of transition words or phrases appear in this paragraph?” (“However,” “during,” “also,” “such as,” “as a result.”)

“What is the purpose of these words and phrases?” (They connect ideas and show how one point relates to the next.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time A, after students analyze Proof Paragraph 2 of the Model Problem-Solution Essay: “Bridges to Prosperity,” invite students to participate in a Mini Language Dive in small groups to explore ways in which multiple gerunds can be used in a sentence to elaborate on a topic and emphasize the complexity of developing solutions to critical problems (W.6.2b). Strongly encourage students to manipulate the structure of the Practice section to use in their own problem-solution essays.

For Heavier Support

- Proof Paragraph 2 of the Model Problem-Solution Essay: “Bridges to Prosperity” elaborates on the sentence from the optional Mini Language Dive of Work Time A (“However, the process of imagining, planning, creating, testing, and improving the solution is far from simple”) by giving examples of steps from the “imagining” and “planning” phases. Invite students to generate a visual that represents this process and compare it to the Design Process graphic of Module 2, Unit 1, Lesson 13.

Work Time

B. Collaborative Writing: Draft Proof Paragraph 2 – W.6.2b (25 minutes)

- Move students into writing partners.

- Display and invite students to retrieve their **Problem-Solution Writing Planner: William** and their copy of the **Informative Writing checklist**. Point out the following characteristic on the checklist:

“W.6.2a: I use strategies such as definition, classification, comparison/contrast, and cause/effect, to organize information.”

“W.6.2c: I use appropriate transitions to show how ideas and information connect.”

- Ask:

“Are there any specific criteria you should be aware of and list in the second column on the checklist?” (The essay has one paragraph for describing the problem and one for describing the solution. The essay contains words and phrases that connect my ideas, especially as I transition from the problem to the solution.)

- As students share out, capture their responses in the Characteristics of This Informative Essay column as needed. Refer to the **Informative Writing checklist (example for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Explain that, in this lesson, students will work with their writing partner to draft Proof Paragraph 2, the solution paragraph of the problem-solution essay focused on William Kamkwamba. Students should base their draft on the information they gathered and organized on their **Design Solution: William note-catcher** and Problem-Solution Writing Planner: William. Students should label the second Proof Paragraph with an appropriate heading as shown in the model.

- Distribute **lined paper** or **devices**, and invite writing partners to begin.

- Circulate and monitor, referencing the following resources as necessary:

- **Design-Solution: William note-catcher (example for teacher reference)**

- **Problem Solution Writing Planner: William (example for teacher reference)**

- **Problem-Solution Essay: William (example for teacher reference)**

- With two minutes remaining, refocus students and allow time for them to log off devices or put away materials.

- Circulate to support students as they plan.

- Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target, using a checking for understanding technique. Scan student responses, and make a note of students who might need support. Check in with them moving forward.

Closing and Assessment

A. Reflect on Learning – SL.6.1 (5 minutes)

- Move students into groups of three or four, and have them reread each of the **Habits of Character anchor charts**.

- Invite students to reflect on how habits of character were demonstrated in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
