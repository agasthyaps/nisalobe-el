5-Minute Mini Language Dive

W.6.2b

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

However, **the process of imagining, planning, creating, testing, and improving the solution** is far from simple. (from Proof Paragraph 2 of the Model Problem-Solution Essay: “Bridges to Prosperity”)

**Lesson 3 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after students work with the introduction of the Model Problem-Solution Essay: “Bridges to Prosperity” in Work Time A.

**Rationale**

- Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the Daily Learning Target (I can analyze the structure of the model essay solution paragraph) and W.6.2b by developing a topic with relevant facts that add to the readers’ understanding of a solution designed to address a critical problem.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it includes a linking word (**however**) that depicts its relationship to an earlier idea in the paragraph, it weaves multiple gerunds together to create a long and detailed subject, and it contrasts a long subject with a short predicate.

- Transfer: **The process of** + gerund, gerund, and gerund = to emphasize the complexity of a process when describing a problem and its solution in the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment.

**Deconstruct**

- **However, <u>the process of imagining, planning, creating, testing, and improving the solution</u> is far from simple.**

- Say:

“What does this sentence mean to you?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“Can you figure out why the author used however?” (However signals a contrast, which means that this sentence is saying something that is different from the information presented before.)

- Invite students to reread the previous sentence aloud: **It might seem like solving these problems is simple: build bridges over the rivers.**

“Based on this previous sentence, and on the use of the word however, can you figure out the purpose of our Language Dive sentence?” (Responses may vary, but look for students to recognize that the purpose of this sentence may be to show that the solution to this problem is not simple.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **the process of imagining, planning, creating, testing, and improving the solution**

- Say:

“What do you notice about this chunk?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- If students don’t mention the verbs, say:

“What verbs do you see in this sentence?” (Imagining, planning, creating, testing, improving.)

- If productive, point out that these are all **gerunds**, which are verbs that end in **-ing** and operate grammatically as nouns within a sentence. If time allows, invite students to substitute these gerunds with more traditional nouns (e.g., the process of **elimination**) to see more clearly their noun function.

“What is the relationship between these verbs and the noun process?” (These verbs describe the action that makes up the process; they explain what the process is.)

“Why do you think the writer included so many gerunds to describe the process of developing a solution?” (To emphasize just how complicated this solution is; to accurately depict all steps of a multistep solution.)

**Reconstruct**

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **However, <u>the process of imagining, planning, creating, testing, and improving the solution</u> is far from simple.**

- Draw students’ attention to the adjective phrase **far from simple.**

- Say:

“What does far from simple mean to you?” (Complicated, complex, difficult.)

“What if the writer had used the single word complicated instead of the phrase far from simple? How would the meaning or impact of the sentence change?” (Far from simple has greater emphasis; it also preserves cohesion by connecting more directly to the previous sentence, which uses the adjective simple.)

- Return student attention to the full sentence.

“What is the effect of using multiple gerunds to describe a process?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to recognize that the multiple gerunds highlight the complexity of this process and emphasize that it is “far from simple.”)

“How might you use multiple gerunds in your own problem-solution essays?” (Responses will vary.)

“Now, what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“What do you think is the function of this sentence within the structure of model essay solution paragraph?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to notice that this paragraph helps introduce the solution and prepares readers to learn the many steps of the process.)

“How does the Language Dive help you address the daily learning target: I can analyze the structure of the model essay solution paragraph?” (Responses will vary.)

**Practice**

- Display the following sentence frame:

> **The process of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is far from simple.**
>
> gerund gerund gerund + noun phrase
>
> **(The process of** + gerund, gerund, **and** gerund \[+ noun phrase\] + predicate)

- Say:

“Use this frame to describe elements of a complicated process. Use your own words and work with your partners.”

- Possible student answers:

> **The process of <u>researching, revising</u>, and <u>producing a solution</u> is far from simple.**
