Answers will vary. Sample response: I chose the sentences “Imagine that a raging river separated you from your school, the hospital, or drinkable water. Now imagine that there was no way to safely cross that river.” I think that these sentences demonstrate the writing criterion: “I have an introduction that gives readers the context they need to understand the topic or text.” They are effective because they give context information to demonstrate how the innovator became inspired to address this critical problem. They do so in a way that hooks the reader by giving an intriguing visual.
