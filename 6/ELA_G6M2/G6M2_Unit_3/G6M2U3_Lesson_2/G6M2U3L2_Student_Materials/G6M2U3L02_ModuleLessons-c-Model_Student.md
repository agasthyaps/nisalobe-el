**Research Question:** How was design thinking used to solve a critical problem?

**My Focus:** How Avery Bang and Bridges to Prosperity used design thinking to solve a critical problem

**Introduction**

How will I catch the reader’s attention?

- Scenario about having to cross a dangerous river with no bridge to get to school, work, or the doctor.

What context do I need to give to my reader?

- Explain who Avery Bang and Bridges to Prosperity are, and how she became interested in the problem.

My focus statement:

- B2P builds footbridges that connect people with the resources they need. Helping rural communities access resources and services is a complex problem. Using design thinking, B2P is able to solve it.

What are the main points I will be making to support this focus?

- Explain the problem: No way to cross rivers in rural communities to reach necessary services and resources.

- Explain the solution: Building bridges to connect people and give them access.

**Proof Paragraph 1: PROBLEM**

**Point:** What is the first point that supports my focus?

- Explain the problem:

**Details:** What evidence from the texts supports this point?

- 1 in 7 people live in a “walking existence” and cannot access what they need.

**Elaboration:** How does the innovator respond to this problem?

- Identify struggling communities

- Research the feasibility and cost of building a bridge

- Choose projects that will have the greatest social impact

- Check for demand and commitment from the community

**Proof Paragraph 2: SOLUTION**

**Point:** What is the next point that supports my focus?

- Explain the solution: building bridges to connect people and give them access.

**Details:** What evidence from the texts supports this point?

- Footbridges are designed to carry pedestrians, bikes, animals, and motorbikes.

**Elaboration:** How does the innovator work toward a solution?

- Start with some standardized plans; each has cable handrail and safety fencing. Each takes about 2 months to complete.

- Paid local laborers and local materials are used. B2P trains local tradespeople.

**Conclusion**

My reworded focus statement:

- B2P uses design thinking to solve problems for rural communities by building footbridges that connect them to the services and resources they need.

What further reflections can I make on this topic?
