<td>What habits of character are evident in this experience?</td>
<td><p><strong>Effective Learners</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Initiative: Avery took initiative in calling Ken and wanting to be involved.</p></li>
<li><p>Responsibility: Avery showed responsibility when she devised a plan and a team and funding, which finally enabled Ken to say “yes.”</p></li>
<li><p>Perseverance: Avery didn’t give up trying to work with Ken and B2P.</p></li>
<li><p>Collaboration: Avery worked together with B2P and local governments and communities (and still does) to build the bridges.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ethical People</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Empathy: B2P goes about all projects with the needs and lives of the people they are working with in mind.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrity: B2P only does projects where the local community wants them to, and they do it in sustainable and environmentally friendly ways.</p></li>
<li><p>Respect: B2P respects all the people who work on the collaboration, but most importantly those in whose communities they are working to bridge their connectivity.</p></li>
<li><p>Compassion: B2P’s mission is centered on compassion for other humans and their needs and wants, no matter where they are located.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Contribute to a Better World</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Citizenship: B2P’s mission is about global citizenship and fostering relationships and collaboration.</p></li>
<li><p>Service: B2P’s mission is in service of others.</p></li>
<li><p>Advocacy: B2P advocates, but does not speak for, the communities in which they work.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Avery’s (and B2P’s) experiences show <strong>all</strong> the habits of character. Their main mission is to contribute to a better world, and they are able to do that because they show all these habits of character as they work with local communities to solve the connectivity problems, and by extension also work to reduce poverty through access.</p></td>
