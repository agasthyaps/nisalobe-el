**Directions:** As you enter class, read the learning targets. Then, complete the following.

Review the photograph used to show the critical problem for the Model Performance Task. What does this image help us understand about the problem?

Answers may vary. Sample response: This image helps us understand all the different factors that can make it difficult to get across—the unsafe bridge, the swift river below, the undeveloped landscape, and the lack of people.

What makes this an effective way to demonstrate the problem?

Answers may vary. Sample response: This photograph helps us effectively demonstrate the problem because it shows how dangerous these conditions are. There’s no way to get across, no one around to help, and no resources to fix the problem.

Review the photographs used to show the design solution of the Model Performance Task. What do these images help us understand about the solution?

Answers may vary. Sample response: These images help us understand that even though the bridges are very different from each other, they appear to be safe and secure.

What makes this an effective way to demonstrate the solution?

Answers may vary. Sample response: This photograph helps us effectively demonstrate the solution because they are being used by people and animals. It also shows that a seemingly simple concept, like a bridge, can change people’s lives.

Review the graphics you have collected so far for your flip-down visual. How effectively do your graphics communicate the problem or solution for a potential viewer? What might make this part of your visual even more effective?

Answers may vary. Sample response: My solution graphic effectively communicates the problem or solution because it is a diagram of the exact device created to fix the problem. My visual could be more effective if I could more clearly demonstrate the problem; right now, it’s too abstract and would be hard for a viewer to understand without an explanation.
