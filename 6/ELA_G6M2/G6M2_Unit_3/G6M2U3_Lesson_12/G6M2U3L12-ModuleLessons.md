Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- SL.6.2 – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they examine the visuals included in the model performance task and explain how they contribute to our understanding of the topic being presented.

- SL.6.5 – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they examine the visuals included in the model performance task and explain why they were effective in clarifying important information in the presentation.

- SL.6.5 – Work Time A: Students continue to develop their visuals for the performance task to share their learning from their research into a different critical problem and design solution.

- SL.6.1c – Closing and Assessment A: Students practice posing and responding to specific questions with elaboration and detail as they give feedback during the Peer Share.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Incorporate more practice with L.6.5 by noting the use of alliteration in the title of the performance task, Solution Symposium, and in one of the components, Presentation Prompts. Invite students to think of other examples of alliteration, especially in company names, such as Bed, Bath, and Beyond or Dunkin Donuts. Facilitate a discussion around the purpose of alliteration and why it is so often used in titles or names.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students critiqued a model presentation for the Solution Symposium and began creating the visuals needed for their own presentation. In this lesson, students continue preparing the flip-down visual, a core component of their performance task presentation.

Support All Students

- Note that there is a differentiated version of the entrance ticket used in Opening A in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Support students as they incorporate graphics into their flip-down visuals. This also provides a more manageable workload for some ELLs, for whom writing is especially challenging. ▲ Point students toward free resources that provide high-quality images, such as http://eled.org/0181 or http://eled.org/0147, for students who are not inclined toward original illustrations. Remind students that it is the thinking and presentation skills that are being practiced; students are not being assessed on their artistic talents.

- It may be challenging for some students to stay on task for an extended period of time. Help students break up the time by encouraging them to set a series of small goals to track their progress and maintain their pace. Consider grouping those who will find this challenging to work with support.

- ELLs may be especially concerned that the language of their performance task materials is used correctly. Help students locate and remedy language errors that affect overall clarity of ideas, while also reminding students that language errors are okay and that they will not be formally assessed on this assignment. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson gives students time to continue preparing materials for their performance task presentations. These materials are intended to provide a visual component for students to refer to and describe during their presentations. They contain little text, easing the writing load for students who may be experiencing burn-out after the mid-unit assessment and facilitating an opportunity for students to exercise other skills and talents.

- ELLs may find it challenging to transition from producing visuals to preparing accompanying oral presentations. Remind them that the following lesson will be devoted to rehearsing and refining their presentations, giving students ample time to make adjustments as needed.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standard 6.I.A.4.

Assessment Guidance

- The performance tasks at the end of every module are neither formative nor summative assessments. For these reasons, it is recommended that performance tasks be evaluated only through the lens of the attributes of high-quality student work (authenticity, complexity, and craftsmanship).

- Require students to use at least one of the sentence frames provided in Closing and Assessment A to assess SL.6.1c

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue to prepare and practice their presentation for the Solution Symposium. The Solution Symposium occurs in Lesson 14.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – SL.6.5 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 12** or optional **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 12**. ▲ Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 12 (example for teacher reference)** as needed. Students will also need to reference the **Model Performance Task**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- During Opening A, invite students who need heavier support to use the Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 12 ▲. This resource features partially completed sentence frames to support students’ comprehension and reduce the amount of writing they are expected to complete.

Work Time

A. Prepare Performance Task Visual – SL.6.5 (30 minutes)

- Explain that in today’s lesson students will finish designing their visuals and prepare their explanatory notes about the problem and solution. Explain that the notes should help them to remember what they want to say about the problem and solution, including the information they want to point out in the visual they are creating and how it helps the viewer to understand the issue. Remind them to use the model and the **Performance Task anchor chart** as they create their own.

- Invite students to retrieve the following materials:

- **Performance Task: Solution Symposium**

- **Design Solution: Research note-catcher**

- **Problem-Solution Essay**

- Model Performance Task

- **Presentation checklist**

- Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**. Draw their attention to the habit of character *initiative*. Remind students of what this means and what it looks like (I see what needs to be done and take the lead on making responsible decisions; doing things without being asked).

- Provide students with art supplies to create their visuals, such as **blank paper**, **construction paper**, **colored pencils or markers**, and **scissors**, or **computers/tablets**.

- Direct students to websites where they can access free, high-quality stock photos and clip art, such as http://eled.org/0181 or http://eled.org/0147.

- As students work, circulate to answer questions, push their thinking, and provide support as needed. Remind them to review the model and the anchor chart to help them make decisions and to also use one another as thought-partners.

- Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target, using a checking for understanding technique—for example, showing thumbs-up or traffic light signal cards. Scan student responses and make a note of students who might need support. Check in with them moving forward.

For Lighter Support

- To prepare students for the performance task, circulate around the classroom as students develop their flip-down visuals and invite them to practice annotating the visual aloud, describing and explaining it like they will during the Solution Symposium of Lesson 14. Encourage students who need lighter support to notice patterns in their description of the visual and transform these patterns into sentence frames, whose structures can be replicated by students who need heavier support during their own presentations.

- Help students who need lighter support to infuse their presentations with some drama. Work with them to locate places where pauses, rhetorical questions, or changes in intonation could spark the audience’s interest during the presentation of the flip-down visual.

For Heavier Support

- To prepare students for the performance task, circulate around the classroom as students develop their flip-down visuals and invite them to practice annotating the visual aloud, describing and explaining it like they will during the Solution Symposium of Lesson 14. Provide sentence frames (either self-generated or created by students who need lighter support) that students can use to practice explaining their visual to an audience.

Closing and Assessment

A. Peer Share: Performance Task Visual – SL.6.1c (10 minutes)

- Direct students to pair up and share their in-progress flip-down visuals and notes for feedback. Each partner will give one star and one step to help improve their visual or notes.

- Explain that feedback is often best presented in the form of a question that guides the presenter to elaborate on the topic and add more details.

- Post and read aloud the following sentence frames:

“Can you say more about . . . ?”

“Will you explain what you mean by . . . ?”

“I found myself wondering . . . ?”

- Direct students to use at least one of the sentence frames when giving feedback to their partner. Invite students to begin.

- Once pairs are done sharing, field any new questions about the specifics of the flip-down visual. Clarify that, in the next lesson, they will prepare their answers to the presentation prompts and then have an opportunity to rehearse their presentation with partners.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Prepare Solution Symposium

- Students continue to prepare the graphics and text for their performance task visual.
