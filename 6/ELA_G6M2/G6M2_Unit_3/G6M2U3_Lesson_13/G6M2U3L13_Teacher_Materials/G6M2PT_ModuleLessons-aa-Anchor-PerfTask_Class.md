You uncovered a critical problem. You researched a design-solution. Now, share your learning with others!

We, as a class, are going to host a **Solution Symposium**! Now, you might be wondering, *What is a “symposium”?* Here’s the definition:

**sym-po-si-um:** a formal meeting or conference, where experts discuss a particular subject

The subject of *our* symposium is “critical problems and their design-solutions” and the experts are . . . <u>you</u>! Each of you will create a visual representation on paper of the problem and design-solution that you researched for your essays. You will hang the visuals on the wall and, during the symposium, you will stand next to them. Guests will visit your station and you will present your problem and solution, using your visuals to help you explain.

Symposiums make presentations look a little different than you might be used to. Instead of presenting one at a time to the class, many of you will present at the same time to different people. Guests will walk from station to station to learn more about the problems and solutions you have researched.

**Your participation in the Solution Symposium will include the following elements:**

- Relevant text information to describe the problem you researched.

- A clear explanation of the design-solution you researched.

- An artful flip-down visual that depicts the problem and the solution.

- Carefully organized text and visuals to guide guests through your presentation.

- Thoughtful responses about how design thinking and habits of character were used to solve your problem.

- The ability to repeat your presentation as new guests arrive at your station, improving or adapting as needed.
