Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.6.5 – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they give and receive peer feedback on their Problem-Solution Writing Planners and use that feedback to strengthen their writing.

- W.6.2a – Work Time A: Students analyze the introduction of the Model Problem-Solution Essay: “Bridges to Prosperity.”

- W.6.2a – Work Time B: Students work with their partners to draft an introduction for their problem-solution essays on William.

- W.6.4 – Work Time B: Students produce clear and coherent introductions, taking into account the purpose of the piece and the context needed by the reader.

- W.6.5 – Work Time B: With support from their partners, students develop their writing, producing a collaborative draft of an introduction.

- SL.6.2 – Work Time B: Students interpret the information they have collected from diverse media and use it to explain how design thinking was used to solve a critical problem.

- In this lesson, students work to become effective learners, focusing on a characteristic of their choice as they draft their introductions.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- An optional Mini Language Dive, intended for use after Work Time A, is available in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲ This Mini Language Dive invites students to explore the way in which the opening sentence of the Model Problem-Solution Essay: “Bridges to Prosperity” evokes empathy in the reader as a way to help the reader understand why a problem is critical. Consider developing an extension to this Mini Language Dive that prompts students to produce alternative first sentences to the model essay that target other habits of character.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lessons, students compared the model note-catcher to the model writing planner to understand the steps of the writing process. In this lesson, students analyze the introduction of the model essay and compose their own for their collaborative essay about William.

Support All Students

- Students may need additional support drafting their introductions. Group those students and lead a discussion that will guide them to giving context to the reader about how an innovator addressed a critical problem.

- To support ELLs, this lesson invites students to first engage with the introduction of the Model Problem-Solution Essay: “Bridges to Prosperity” by rearranging sentence strips to reproduce the introduction before reading it aloud together as a class. This exercise hones student attention to smaller and more manageable amounts of text at a time, improves awareness of paragraph structure by allowing students to easily move around sentences to understand their function in a sentence, and unites reading and speaking skills by requiring active reading and collaboration.

- ELLs may find it challenging to draft the introductions of their essays. Make Work Time B more focused and/or more playful by inviting students to simulate the sentence strips activity from Work Time A. Provide blank strips to each pair, and encourage them to draft their introduction, one sentence at a time, on the strips, before piecing them together. Allocating attention to one sentence at a time may help students feel less overwhelmed. This exercise may also reinforce the idea that each sentence in the introduction serves a related, but distinct, purpose and should not simply repeat information.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.4, 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.7, 6.I.C.10, 6.I.C.11, 6.I.C.12, 6.II.A.1, 6.II.A.2, 6.II.B.5, 6.II.C.6, and 6.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- Use the Grade 6 Writing Process checklist to assess students’ writing abilities in Work Time B (see the Tools Page at http://eled.org/tools).

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will draft the first Proof Paragraph of their collaborative essays.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.6.5 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 3**. Students will also need their **Problem-Solution Writing Planner: William**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. The Painted Essay®: Sort and Color-Code the Parts of an Introduction – W.6.2a (15 minutes)

- Move students into their predetermined writing partners.

- Distribute **Organize the Model: Introduction strips** and **scissors**. Direct students to cut out the strips.

- Remind students of the parts of an introduction:

- Context: information to engage the reader and provide needed background

- Focus statement

- Explain that pairs need to put the parts together in the right order.

- Tell students that when they have finished, they will check their work against the **Model Problem-Solution Essay: “Bridges to Prosperity.”**

- Invite students to begin, and circulate to support students in reading and sorting the strips of the introduction.

- Refocus whole group.

- Invite students to chorally read the introduction together as a class, stopping after each sentence to explain its function in the paragraph. As needed, allow processing time and cue students to think internally:

“I’ll give you time to think and write or sketch.”

For Lighter Support

- For further practice with the paraphrasing skills targeted during Unit 2, invite students who need lighter support to paraphrase two or three sentences from the introduction of the Model Problem-Solution Essay: “Bridges to Prosperity.” Challenge them to not only exchange words for their synonyms, but also to rearrange structural components of the sentence(s) to produce grammatically distinct sentences that preserve the same ideas as the originals.

- In Work Time A, after students analyze the introduction of the Model Problem-Solution Essay: “Bridges to Prosperity,” invite students to participate in a Mini Language Dive in small groups to explore ways to use a verb written in the imperative mood (*Imagine*) to evoke empathy and capture the reader’s attention in an introduction (W.6.2a, L.6.3a). Strongly encourage students to manipulate the structure of the Practice section to use as a “hook” in their own problem-solution essays.

For Heavier Support

- For further practice with the paraphrasing skills targeted during Unit 2, provide students who need heavier support with simple paraphrases of sentences from the introduction of the Model Problem-Solution Essay: “Bridges to Prosperity” and give them time to locate the original sentences in the essay. Examples can be found below:

- *Paraphrase*: Many remote communities have rivers that isolate them and limit their ability to attend school, get a job, or get medical attention. (*Original sentence*: The problem for many isolated communities is that rivers separate them from schools, jobs, and health services.)

- *Paraphrase*: The connectivity and access provided by these bridges help reduce rural poverty. (*Original sentence*: These bridges tackle poverty in rural areas by connecting communities to services they could not access before.)

Work Time

B. Collaborative Writing: Draft an Introduction – W.6.2a (20 minutes)

- Invite students to retrieve their Problem-Solution Writing Planner: William and their copy of the **Informative Writing checklist**. Point out the following characteristic on the checklist:

“W.6.2a: I have an introduction that gives readers the context they need to understand the topic or text.”

- Ask:

“Are there any specific criteria you should be aware of and list in the second column on the checklist?” (The introduction gives context information about the problem, the innovator, and how he/she became inspired to address this critical problem.)

- As students share out, capture their responses in the Characteristics of This Informative Essay column as needed. Refer to the **Informative Writing checklist (example for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Explain that, in this lesson, students will work with their writing partner to draft their introduction to the problem-solution essay focused on William Kamkwamba. Students should base their draft on the information they gathered and organized on their **Design Solution: William note-catcher** and Problem-Solution Writing Planner: William.

- Distribute **lined paper** or **devices**, and invite writing partners to begin.

- Circulate and monitor, referencing the following resources as necessary:

- **Design-Solution: William note-catcher (example for teacher reference)**

- **Problem Solution Writing Planner: William (example for teacher reference)**

- **Problem-Solution Essay: William (example for teacher reference)**

- With two minutes remaining, refocus students and allow time for them to log off devices or put away materials.

- Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target, using a checking for understanding technique. Scan student responses, and make a note of students who might need support. Check in with them moving forward.

Closing and Assessment

A. Reflect on Learning – SL.6.1 (5 minutes)

- Move students into groups of three or four, and have them reread each of the **Habits of Character anchor charts**.

- Invite students to reflect on how habits of character were demonstrated in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- In the following lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a key sentence from Proof Paragraph 1 of the Model Problem-Solution Essay: “Bridges to Prosperity.” Provide ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Challenge students who need lighter support to rewrite the sentence using different sentence-starters without changing the meaning and without trimming any information from the sentence. These sentence-starters should require manipulating and/or moving around different elements of the sentence:

- One in seven people \_\_\_\_\_. \[e.g., One in seven people <u>cannot safely access the services and products they need to survive, which is a critical problem (Bang).</u>\]

- This is a critical problem because the services and products \_\_\_\_\_. \[e.g., This is a critical problem because the services and products <u>that people need to survive cannot be safely accessed by one in seven people (Bang).</u>\]

For Heavier Support

- In the following lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a key sentence from Proof Paragraph 1 of the Model Problem-Solution Essay: “Bridges to Prosperity.” Provide ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Invite students who need heavier support to underline words in the sentence using different colors according to their parts of speech (nouns, blue; verbs, red; adjectives, yellow; pronouns, purple). Challenge them not to use a dictionary to help them. Check students’ answers later and, as needed, incorporate additional part-of-speech work into future lessons.

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
