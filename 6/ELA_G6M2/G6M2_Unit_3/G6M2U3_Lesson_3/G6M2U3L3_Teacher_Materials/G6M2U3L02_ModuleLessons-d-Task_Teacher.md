**Research Question:** How was design thinking used to solve a critical problem?

**My Focus:** How William Kamkwamba used design thinking to solve a critical problem

**Introduction**

How will I catch the reader’s attention?

Ask readers to think about living without electricity.

What context do I need to give to my reader?

Who William is, where he lived, and some of his backstory.

My focus statement:

As an eighth grader, William found a way to get the water his family needed. Helping to ensure his family’s survival was a complex problem, but, using design thinking, William was able to solve it.

What are the main points I will be making to support this focus?

- Explain the problem:

Needed a way to get water to crops but electricity was rare, expensive, and unreliable.

- Explain the solution:

Build windmill to generate electricity for irrigation.

**Proof Paragraph 1: PROBLEM**

**Point:** What is the first point that supports my focus?

- Explain the problem:

lack of electricity

This was a critical problem because without electricity, William and his community were in danger of another drought and deadly famine.

**Details:** What evidence from the texts supports this point?

If they had electricity, farmers could pump water to irrigate their crops no matter what the weather.

**Elaboration:** How does the innovator respond to this problem?

William went to the library to learn about how to get water to crops and discovered windmills.

William demonstrated the first steps in design thinking. He read books, asked questions, and researched to get ideas for solving this problem.

**Proof Paragraph 2: SOLUTION**

**Point:** What is the next point that supports my focus?

- Explain the solution:

Build windmill to generate electricity for irrigation.

**Details:** What evidence from the texts supports this point?

“Finally, the dream had been accomplished. My family couldn’t have imagined that the little windmill I built during the famine would change their lives in every way, and they saw this change as a gift from heaven” (274).

**Elaboration:** How does the innovator work toward a solution?

William tried several solutions

Built a prototype with objects he found

Improved on his design

**Conclusion**

My reworded focus statement:

William used design thinking to solve a problem for his family by building a windmill that generated electricity, allowing them to irrigate their fields and improve their quality of life.

What further reflections can I make on this topic?

(Include impact of the solution to the critical problem, as well as habits of character evident in the problem-solution experience.)

- Impact:

William’s design-thinking and his desire to make a better life for his family and community didn’t stop with that one windmill.

- Habits of character:

He has modeled initiative, responsibility, perseverance, collaboration, empathy, integrity, respect, and compassion in all he does. Design thinking can not only solve problems, it can make us better people in the process!
