5-Minute Mini Language Dive

W.6.2a, L.6.3a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

**Imagine that a raging river separated you from** your school, the hospital, or drinkable water. (from the introduction paragraph of the Model Problem-Solution Essay: “Bridges to Prosperity”)

**Lesson 3 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after students read the introduction of the Model Problem-Solution Essay: “Bridges to Prosperity” in Work Time A.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the Daily Learning Target (**I can analyze the structure of the model essay introduction**) and W.6.2a and L.6.3a by introducing a topic with an impactful sentence that captures the reader’s attention and offers important background information.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses the imperative mood to directly address the reader and prompts the reader to practice empathy by imagining difficult circumstances faced by others.

- Transfer: Imperative verb (**Imagine**) + **that** + independent clause = to address the reader and elicit empathy to help them understand why a problem is critical.

**Deconstruct**

- **<u>Imagine that a raging river separated you from</u> your school, the hospital, or drinkable water.**

- Say:

“What does this sentence mean to you?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **Imagine that a raging river separated you from**

“What do you notice about grammar of the verb imagine?” (It is a command; it is written in the imperative mood; it directly addresses the reader.)

“What do we do to a verb to write it in the imperative?” (We use the word in its base, infinitive form.)

- If time allows, invite ELLs to share how the imperative mood is expressed grammatically in their home languages.

- Point out that verbs written in the imperative mood in English have an implied **you** (as in, “\[You\] imagine that . . .”). Prompt students to think of other examples of verbs they commonly hear used in the imperative mood (e.g., **eat** your vegetables; **do** your homework; Turn and Talk to your partners).

“With this command, what is the writer telling the reader to do?” (To use their imagination; to think about something and visualize it.)

- Draw student attention to the noun phrase **a raging river**.

“What does a raging river look like or sound like?” (Responses will vary, but guide students in understanding that a raging river would be wild, violent, and moving very quickly.)

**Reconstruct**

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **<u>Imagine that a raging river separated you from</u> your school, the hospital, or drinkable water.**

- Cover the words **Imagine that** with your hands, and prompt students to notice that the remaining words (**a raging river separated you from your school, the hospital, or drinkable water**) forms an independent clause. It can stand alone as a complete sentence.

“How do you think you would feel if you and your family were on one side of a raging river, and your school, the hospital, and drinkable water were on the other side?” (Scared; helpless; unsure of what to do.)

- If time allows, encourage students to close their eyes and truly imagine these circumstances. Point out that visualizing this problem is exactly what the author instructed the reader to do.

“What habit of character do we use when we imagine and try to understand the experiences or emotions of other people?” (Empathy.)

“How might empathy help us understand and solve critical problems?” (Responses may vary, but look for students to recognize that sharing another person’s feelings or understanding their experiences can help us approach problems as if they are our own.)

“How would the impact of this sentence change if the imperative mood were removed and it were instead written as ‘Raging rivers separate some people from their schools, hospitals, or drinkable water’?” (It would be less impactful; it invites less empathy; it aims to inform rather than to evoke emotion.)

- If needed, draw student attention back to the Model Problem-Solution Essay: “Bridges to Prosperity.” Say:

“Where can this sentence be found in the Model Problem-Solution Essay: ‘Bridges to Prosperity’?” (It is the first sentence of the essay.)

“What is the role of the first sentence in an essay? In other words, what do we want the first sentence to do?” (Capture the reader’s attention; provide important background information.)

“Do you think that this sentence effectively captures the reader’s attention? Do you think that this sentence effectively provides important background information? What, in the sentence, makes you think so?” (Responses will vary.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question: What habits of character can help solve a critical problem to contribute to a better community?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to point out that this sentence illustrates the role of empathy in understanding problems and seeking to solve them.)

**Practice**

- Display the following sentence frame:

> **Imagine that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**
>
> independent clause
>
> (imperative verb + conjunction **that** + independent clause)

- Say:

“Use this frame to help the reader imagine what it would be like to grow up in William’s village during the drought and famine. Think about how you might be able to help the reader understand why William’s problem was critical. Use your own words and work with your partners.”

- Sample response:

> **Imagine that <u>a devastating drought and famine prevented you from having clean water and reliable food.</u>**
