Track Progress: Collaborative Discussion

**Name:** **Date:**

**Learning Target**: I can participate in an effective collaborative discussion.

**Standards I’m Tracking**: SL.6.1

1.  How am I doing?

- For each criterion, self-assess by putting a check mark in the appropriate column.

- Strive to be honest with yourself. Remember, your ability grows with your effort, so it’s fine if you aren’t there yet!

You will receive feedback on different colored sticky notes/flags and in a different colored pen on the checklist.
