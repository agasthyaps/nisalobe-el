Throughout this module, you have been following William’s journey to solve the critical problem his community faced in Malawi. You have also researched your own example of a critical problem and design solution, and you learned about your peers’ research during the Solution Symposium. For this assessment, you are going to synthesize your understanding about how habits of character aided all of these innovators.

This assessment has three parts. In Part I, you will complete a QuickWrite to help you prepare for the discussion. In Part II, you will participate in a Fishbowl discussion. In Part III, you will revise your QuickWrite to capture the new learning you gained from the discussion.
