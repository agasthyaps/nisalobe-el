**Fishbowl Discussion Prompt**

How do habits of character help people solve critical problems?

**Directions for Fishbowl**

Assign each student a partner.

Separate students into two groups: outer circle and inner circle.

Explain responsibilities of each group:

- Inner Circle: Answer the discussion prompt. Draw evidence from *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, your research, and your notes from the Solution Symposium to elaborate on your points. Continue discussing, asking questions, and drawing others into the conversation until time is called.

- Outer Circle: Listen to the conversation of the members of the inner circle. Evaluate the discussion using the rubric. Be prepared to build on the discussion when time is called and groups switch.
