Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Work Time A: Students complete the End of Unit 3 Assessment. First, they complete a QuickWrite addressing the question “How do habits of character help people solve critical problems?” (W.6.10) Then, they engage in a collaborative fishbowl discussion to discuss their answers to this question with classmates. They interpret information presented in diverse formats, extracting details and examples from their QuickWrites, *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*, their own research, and their Solution Symposium note-catchers to support their answers. Finally, they return to their QuickWrites and revise them to show their expanded understanding of the question after participation in the discussion. (SL.6.1, SL.6.2, SL.6.6)

- In Opening A, students’ Mid-Unit 3 Assessments are returned with feedback. This allows students the opportunity to see how they performed in order to improve in their next assessment, and to ask questions if they don’t understand the feedback.

- In this lesson, the habit of character focus is on working to become an ethical person. The characteristics that students practice are respect, empathy, and compassion as they participate in a text-based discussion.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Extend the fishbowl discussion by asking students what implications their learning has on their everyday lives. This serves as an opportunity to make a personal connection between the concepts and habits of character learned throughout the module to the students’ lives. This practice takes the learning of the classroom beyond the classroom environment.

- Students can participate in a practice fishbowl discussion to prepare themselves for the end of unit assessment. Use a different prompt, such as “How is design thinking evident in the innovative design solutions from the Solution Symposium?” Students can record the fishbowl discussion and discuss some stars and steps that will strengthen their participation in the assessment discussion.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students participated in the Solution Symposium. One of the key components of the Solution Symposium was considering the habits of character the design innovator utilized to be successful. The collection of information on the Solution Symposium note-catcher provides students with evidence-based examples they can use as they contribute to the fishbowl discussion in this lesson.

Support All Students

- To create a more manageable grading situation for the assessment, consider splitting the class in half. As one half of the class is participating in the modified fishbowl discussion, the other half of the class can be independently working on another assignment unrelated to the assessment.

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment.

- Some students may require more than the time allotted to complete the assessment.

- To support ELLs, this lesson invites students to complete assessment tasks that draw upon learning from the entire module. After completing a QuickWrite to organize their thoughts, students participate in a discussion based on the prompt “How do habits of character help people solve critical problems?” Students have the opportunity to reflect on major themes from the module, using a familiar Fishbowl protocol that students first practiced at the end of Unit 1. Then, they will return to their QuickWrites to add any important learning drawn from the discussion.

- ELLs may find it challenging to synthesize major ideas from the module during a brief text-based discussion. Remind them of not only their targeted preparation in the previous lesson, but also of the related tasks they have completed and ideas they have explored across the module.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.2, 6.I.A.3, 6.I.A.4, and 6.I.B.5.

Assessment Guidance

- The End of Unit 3 Assessment (student and teacher version) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback to students on this assessment, use the Collaborative Discussion checklist (see Assessment Overview and Resources) to help complete the student Track Progress recording form. Make notes in the appropriate column for each criterion in a different color than student responses. There is also space provided to respond to student comments.

Down the Road

- This lesson concludes Module 2.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare the End of Unit 3 Assessment (see Assessment Overview and Resources).

- Determine the two student groups for the assessment and the pairs that will observe each other, as well as the order in which groups will discuss. Post this information. Consider obtaining a timer or displaying an online timer to ensure that the fishbowl discussion is contained to two 7-minute increments.

- If splitting the class to create a more manageable discussion, prepare an independent assignment for students to complete as they are waiting to participate in the discussion.

- Gather students’ Track Progress folders and organize for distribution.

- Count out stacks of seven sticky notes each for student work on their Track Progress forms.

- Prepare all handouts that are separate from the assessment (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time A: Students may complete their QuickWrite

- using an online word-processing tool—for example, http://eled.org/0158 or

- in a word-processing document using speech-to-text facilities activated on devices or using an app or software such as http://eled.org/0103.

- Work Time B: Record the fishbowl discussion to show students later and use as a learning tool to improve class discussions. The video recording may also help the grading process for the discussion.

- Work Time B: Students return to their QuickWrite and revise it after the fishbowl discussion.

- Closing and Assessment A: Students may complete their Writing Record

- using an online word-processing tool—for example, http://eled.org/0158 or

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Return Mid-Unit 3 Assessments – W.6.10 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 15**. Students will also need their **Mid-Unit 3 Assessment with feedback**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. End of Unit 3 Assessment, Part I: QuickWrite – W.6.10 (5 minutes)

- Distribute **End of Unit 3 Assessment**.

- Read aloud the directions for Part I of the assessment as students read silently to follow along. Ensure all students understand the assessment directions. Answer their questions, refraining from supplying answers to the assessment questions themselves.

- Remind students to use details and examples from ***The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind***, their own research, and their **Solution Symposium note-catcher** to support and explain their thinking.

- Invite students to begin working on Part I of the assessment.

- After 5 minutes have passed, refocus students whole group.

- Inform students:

“Part I of the assessment has concluded. We will now prepare to begin Part II of the assessment.”

For Lighter Support

- Before the assessment of Work Time A and Work Time B, underline key vocabulary in the assessment directions and prompt and read aloud together as a class to ensure that students understand each task included in the assessment. Invite students who need lighter support to restate or clarify information for students who need heavier support.

Work Time

B. End of Unit 3 Assessment, Part II: Fishbowl Discussion – SL.6.1, SL.6.2, SL.6.6 (25 minutes)

- Focus students on the **Discussion Norms anchor chart**, specifically on the cues and responses. Remind students that a discussion is not just about saying what we want to say. Effective participation is about listening to others and asking and answering questions. Questions help us to be completely clear about what others are saying and to clarify our own points. Inform students that, in this fishbowl discussion, it’s important they build off each other’s ideas and ask questions of their peers to deepen their understanding throughout the discussion.

- Focus students on the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**. Remind students that it is not easy for everyone to participate in a discussion. Uplift the habits of respect, compassion, and empathy in preparation for the discussion.

- Focus students on Part II of the assessment. Read aloud the directions as students read silently to follow along. Ensure all students understand the assessment directions.

- Display the **End of Unit 3 Assessment: Modified Fishbowl Protocol** instructions. Read aloud the steps of the protocol as students silently follow along. Ensure all students understand the protocol instructions. Answer their questions and clarify any misunderstanding about the protocol.

- Assign each student a partner. Situate students in an inner and an outer circle. Remind the students in the outer circle to observe their partner in the inner circle. Remind students that groups will switch after 7 minutes; each group will have 7 minutes in each of the circles.

- Begin the discussion with the inner circle participants by reminding them of the prompt:

“How do habits of character help people solve critical problems?”

- Monitor the flow of the discussion. Be sure to use the **End of Unit 3 Assessment: Part II Fishbowl Discussion Recording Sheet** to document the participation of students in the inner circle and mastery of standards for this section of the assessment.

- Remind students to utilize their Solution Symposium note-catcher and End of Unit 3 Assessment, Part I: QuickWrite during the discussion. Use probing questions to restart the discussion if it stalls.

- Consider using these questions as a probing question to restart the discussion if it stalls:

“How are the innovators similar? How are they different?”

“Where do you see evidence of design thinking in the innovator’s process?”

- Refocus whole group. Inform students:

“Part II of the assessment has concluded. We will now begin Part III of the assessment.”

- Read aloud the directions for Part III of the assessment as students read follow along silently. Ensure all students understand the assessment directions.

- Invite students to begin Part III of the assessment.

- After 5 minutes have passed, refocus the whole group.

- Inform students:

“Part III of the assessment has concluded. We will now track progress of our learning.”

For Lighter Support

- Before the assessment of Work Time A and Work Time B, underline key vocabulary in the assessment directions and prompt and read aloud together as a class to ensure that students understand each task included in the assessment. Invite students who need lighter support to restate or clarify information for students who need heavier support.

Closing and Assessment

A. Track Progress: Collaborative Discussion – SL.6.1 (10 Minutes)

- Give students specific positive feedback on their completion of the End of Unit 3 Assessment (e.g., “I was pleased to see a lot of you referring to your note-catchers to find details”).

- Distribute **Track Progress: Collaborative Discussion** and **Track Progress folders**. Tell students that successful learners keep track of and reflect on their own learning.

- Distribute **sticky notes**. Tell students to use these to identify evidence in their work from the unit of their progress toward each criterion.

- Tell students the sticky notes are for them to find evidence of the following criteria:

- SL.6.1a

- SL.6.1b

- SL.6.1c

- Instruct students to not complete rows on the tracker pertaining to SL.6.1d.

- Distribute the **Writing Record**. Explain that this form can help students to keep track of all of the writing they complete this year. Direct students to fill in the next row of the Writing Record about the QuickWrite they just completed for the End of Unit 3 Assessment.

- Invite students to place the form in their Track Progress folder, and collect students’ folders.

For Lighter Support

- To celebrate the end of Module 2, invite students to participate in an activity in which they draw another student’s name from a hat or bowl and publicly share one way in which that student has shown key habits of character during this module. Challenge students who need lighter support to generate sentence frames that students who need heavier support can use during the activity. These frames may include the following:

- \_\_\_\_\_ has shown the habit of character of \_\_\_\_\_ by \_\_\_\_\_. \[verb phrase using verb + - *ing* \]
