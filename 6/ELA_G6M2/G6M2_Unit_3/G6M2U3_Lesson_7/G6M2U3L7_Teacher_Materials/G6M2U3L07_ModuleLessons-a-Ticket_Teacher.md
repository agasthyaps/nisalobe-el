(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, read the learning targets. Then, answer the prompt below.

What strategies do you use to stay focused when you really need to be productive? How do you keep yourself from getting distracted? Describe specific practices.

If you want, you can choose one of the practices below and explain your answer.

- Do my most important tasks in the morning.

- Do my most important tasks in the evening.

- Listen to music.

- Do something active if I get distracted.

- Set a timer to keep me focused.

- Work somewhere very quiet.

- Work with other people.

- Work alone.

Answers will vary. Sample response: To stay focused when I really need to be productive, I look at my calendar and decide which tasks are most pressing. I do those tasks in the morning when I’m the most rested and energized. I also like to listen to music while I work, but only instrumental music so the lyrics don’t interrupt my thought process. I prefer to stand up while I work, if possible, and when I start to get distracted I dance around a little bit to get my energy back. It also helps me if I set a timer on my phone for 20 minutes. I tell myself that if I work hard for 20 minutes, I can have a 5-minute break.
