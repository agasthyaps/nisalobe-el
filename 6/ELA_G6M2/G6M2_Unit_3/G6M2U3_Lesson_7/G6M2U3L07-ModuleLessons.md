Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.6.1 – Work Time A: Students plan their own problem-solution essays, which they will write during the mid-unit assessment in the following lessons.

- RI.6.7 – Work Time A: Students integrate information from different media to plan their independent problem-solution essays.

- W.6.2 – Work Time A: Students select, organize, and analyze relevant content to plan a problem-solution essay.

- W.6.4 – Work Time A: Students consider task, purpose, and audience as they plan the content of their essays.

- W.6.5 – Work Time A: With support from the teacher, students plan their problem-solution essays.

- W.6.8 – Work Time A: Students quote and paraphrase information they have gathered from multiple print and digital sources as they complete their writing planners.

- SL.6.2 – Work Time A: Students interpret the information they have collected from diverse media and use it to explain how design thinking was used to solve a problem.

- SL.6.1 – Closing and Assessment A: Students engage in a Peer Critique protocol to discuss their writing and offer feedback.

- If time permits, allow more time for peer review focused on common issues students may struggle with.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to contribute to a better world, using their strengths when working with a partner to give and receive feedback on their plans.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Identify students who have demonstrated strengths in particular parts of the writing process and invite them to conference with their classmates to give advice on their area of expertise.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Students have been analyzing a model and using their analysis to draft a problem-solution essay. In this lesson, students will use what they learned during the collaborative writing process to independently plan their problem-solution essay based on their research in Unit 2.

Support All Students

- Note that there is a differentiated version of the entrance ticket used in Opening A in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Students who struggle to focus may benefit from using a checklist with each discrete task listed for reference during Work Time A. Break the planning process into the smallest tasks possible and celebrate each step students are able to complete.

- Note that adolescence is characterized by extreme self-consciousness. Some students may feel uncomfortable sharing their writing with a peer and accepting constructive criticism. Consider sharing and feedback options that allow for anonymity. Additionally, find areas to praise every student and bolster confidence.

- To support ELLs, this lesson provides ample time for students to apply the learning of previous lessons to the planning of their independent problem-solution essays, which will they write during the mid-unit assessment of the following lessons. An entrance ticket during Opening A improves metacognition by inviting students to reflect on specific strategies they use to stay productive and avoid distraction. A peer critique in Closing and Assessment A gives students the opportunity to identify and remedy potential issues in the planning of their papers.

- ELLs may find it challenging to complete the Problem-Solution Writing Planner: Research in the allotted time, especially if they have little experience or confidence planning or producing papers independently. Work with students to develop a timeline that can keep them moving through their planners at an appropriate pace. Encourage students to think about which sections of the collaborative essay were the most challenging or time-consuming for them and encourage them to allocate the most time to these sections.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.4, 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.7, 6.I.C.10, 6.I.C.11, 6.I.C.12, 6.II.A.1, 6.II.A.2, 6.II.B.5, 6.II.C.6, and 6.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- Use the Grade 6 Writing Process checklist to assess students’ writing abilities in Work Time A (see the Tools Page at http://eled.org/tools).

- Stop in with each student during the writing time for a 1-minute conference to check for understanding.

Down the Road

- In the next two lessons, students will complete the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment for which they independently draft their problem-solution essays based on their research in Unit 2.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Determine strategic groupings for the peer critique in Closing and Assessment A. As students will have likely developed a rapport from working with their writing partners during the first half of this unit, consider reuniting collaborative writing partners for this activity.

- Review the student tasks and example answers to get familiar with what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Prepare copies of handouts for students, including the entrance ticket (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time A: Students who struggle to remain focused may benefit from breaking up the planning time into smaller chunks. Use an online timer set to smaller increments, perhaps 5 minutes, and give students one discrete task to focus on during that 5 minute interval (e.g., filling in just the Introduction section of the writing planner).

- Work Time A: Students may prefer to type their responses for the Problem-Solution Writing Planner: Research. Provide devices with word-processing software, if available.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.6.2 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 7** or optional **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 7** ▲. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 7 (example for teacher reference)** for possible responses.

- Invite students to share out their “best practices” for productivity and record these on the board or on an anchor chart. Be sure to share your own strategies as well! Direct students to pick one or two to try during the writing time in this lesson.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- During Opening A, invite students who need heavier support to use the Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 7 ▲. This resource offers a bank of possible answers that students can select from and support with an explanation, rather than requiring that students generate unique answers on their own.

Work Time

A. Independent Practice: Plan a Problem-Solution Essay – W.6.2 (30 minutes)

- Distribute the **Problem-Solution Writing Planner: Research**.

- Explain that now that students have practiced writing collaboratively about William, they will plan their own essays about the problem and solution they researched in Unit 2.

- Remind students that they may refer to the following Materials as necessary:

- **Model Design Solution: “Bridges to Prosperity” note-catcher**

- **Model Problem-Solution Writing Planner: “Bridges to Prosperity”**

- **Model Problem-Solution Essay: “Bridges to Prosperity”**

- **Design-Solution: Research note-catcher**

- **Informative Writing checklist**

- **Academic word wall**

- **Domain-specific word wall**

- Students may also refer to materials from their collaborative piece on William as needed.

- Circulate to support students as they plan. If necessary, prompt by asking questions such as:

“What headings can you add to clue the reader about the main idea of each paragraph?”

“In your opinion, which habit of character most contributed to the innovator’s success?”

“Where does that piece of information fit in the design thinking process?”

“What evidence do you have for this point?”

- Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target, using a checking for understanding technique. Scan student responses and make a note of students who might need support. Check in with them moving forward.

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time A, encourage students who need lighter support to revisit and polish the sentences they produced during the Practice sections of the Language Dives and Mini Language Dives of Lessons 3, 4, 5, and 6. Allow students to incorporate these sentences into their planners for use in the problem-solution essays that they write during the mid-unit assessment of the following lessons.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time A, provide sentence strips that feature the structural frames that students completed during the Language Dives and Mini Language Dives of Lessons 3, 4, 5, and 6. Encourage them to use these sentences as “checkpoints” around which the remainder of their essay can be built. Some frames may require minor modifications so that they are ready for use in this essays. For example:

- Imagine that \_\_\_\_\_ \[independent clause\].

- This is a critical problem because \_\_\_\_\_ \[independent clause\].

- By \_\_\_\_\_ \[gerund\], \_\_\_\_\_ \[name of innovator\] \_\_\_\_\_ \[verb phrase\].

- For added visual support during Work Time A, distribute simple graphic organizers that reflect a problem-solution structure and invite students who need heavier support to use keywords or short phrases to represent their ideas on the graphic organizer before transferring them over to the Problem-Solution Writing Planner: Research. A visual representation of their researched problem and its solution may help ELLs solidify their ideas.

Closing and Assessment

A. Peer Critique: Problem-Solution Writing Planner – SL.6.1 (10 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can give kind, helpful, and specific feedback to my partner.”

- Display and focus students on their Informative Writing checklist.

- Focus students on the criteria:

“W.6.2a: I provide a clear focus and maintain the focus consistently throughout the piece.”

- Invite students to mark or highlight this criterion, as it will be the focus of the critique. Explain that, due to time constraints, their goal in today’s peer critique is to focus and give feedback on just this one standard.

- Move students into pairs and invite them to label themselves A and B.

- Distribute **sticky notes**. Remind students that this is where they will record stars and stairs for their partner.

- Focus students on the **Work to Contribute to a Better World anchor chart**, specifically “use my strengths.” Remind students that because they will be working to give a critique to their partner, they will need to use their strengths.

- Tell students they will peer critique to provide their partner with kind, specific, and helpful feedback using the criteria on the checklist. Remind them to use the **Directions for Peer Critique** and **Peer Critique Protocol anchor chart**.

- Invite students to provide feedback to their partner based on the criteria identified from the Informative Writing checklist.

- Circulate to support students as they work together to give feedback to one another. Emphasize that students should not make revisions yet.

- Invite students to reflect on their progress towards the relevant learning target, using a checking for understanding technique. Scan student responses and make a note of students who might need support to check in with them moving forward.

- If productive, cue students to consider their thinking:

“How does our peer critique add to your understanding of planning for informational writing? I’ll give you time to think and discuss with a partner.” (Responses will vary.)

Homework

A. Plan Independent Problem-Solution Essay

- Students work to complete their Problem-Solution Writing Planner: Research.

B. Independent Research Reading
