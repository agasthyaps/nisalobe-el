Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- SL.6.2 – Work Time A: Students analyze a model performance task, interpreting information presented in diverse formats and explaining why the included information is effective.

- SL.6.5 – Work Time B: Students begin to develop their visuals for the performance task to share their learning from their research of a different critical problem and design solution.

- During Closing and Assessment A, students are guided through a research reading share to hold them accountable for their research reading homework. Use Independent Reading Sample Plans (see the Tools page: http://eled.org/tools) if not using other independent reading review routines (RI.6.10, SL.6.1).

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become ethical people by showing integrity as they share and discuss the independent reading they have been doing regularly for homework.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Independent research reading sharing is a great opportunity to experiment with fun, creative tools as students share what they have learned from their independent reading. Consider allowing students to explore exciting resources, such as http://eled.org/0156 or http://eled.org/0172. Give students agency to come up with imaginative ways to use these resources to express how their understanding of the module topic was enhanced by their independent reading.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In this lesson, students use the information from their research and essay about a critical problem and design solution to prepare for the Solution Symposium, which provides an opportunity to showcase their learning as a culmination to this unit and this module.

- Students have also been engaging in independent reading since Unit 1; students connect the learning they have done in their independent work with the module topic during this lesson’s share.

Support All Students

- The model performance task materials are interactive, manipulable, and visually appealing. Encourage students to create materials according to their own tastes and to be as creative and inventive as they like.

- Students may need additional support working independently to prepare for the performance task. Group those who will find this challenging to work with support.

- Support students as they incorporate graphics into their flip-down visuals. This also provides a more manageable workload for some ELLs, for whom writing is especially challenging. ▲ Point students toward free resources that provide high-quality images, such as http://eled.org/0181 or http://eled.org/0147, for students who are not inclined toward original illustrations. Remind students that it is the thinking and presentation skills that are being practiced; students are not being assessed on their artistic talents.

- It may be challenging for some students to stay on task for an extended period of time. Help students break up the time by encouraging them to set a series of small goals to track their progress and maintain their pace.

- To support ELLs, this lesson invites students to analyze a model performance task before beginning to prepare their own. Deconstructing a model before working independently helps students clarify expectations and set appropriate goals. Also in this lesson, students begin to develop the visuals for their performance task presentations, focusing first on the visual representation of the critical problem they researched before. Finally, students share their independent research reading, giving them a space to celebrate their own learning and share content knowledge with their classmates.

- ELLs may find it challenging to shift gears from the problem-solution essays they spent much of the unit preparing to write to an oral presentation remediating the same information in a new way. Carefully read students’ answers on the Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 11 to gauge students’ attitudes toward the performance task and, as needed, invite students to elaborate on their responses. Provide support as needed to students who report feeling nervous or overwhelmed.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.2 and 6.I.A.4.

Assessment Guidance

- The performance tasks at the end of every module are neither formative nor summative assessments. They are not formative because they come at the end of the module, concluding students’ learning about the module topic and the literacy skills they have built over 8 or 9 weeks. However, they are also not summative because they are heavily scaffolded to help students create high-quality work and so are not a strong measure of what students can do independently. For these reasons, we do not recommend analyzing performance tasks with the same lens used to analyze assessments. Look at students’ performance tasks through the lens of the attributes of high-quality student work (authenticity, complexity, and craftsmanship).

- In this lesson, students are introduced to some characteristics of effective presentations. Use the Speaking and Listening Informal Assessment: Presentation of Knowledge and Ideas checklist to informally assess their presentations, using only the relevant categories which are reflected in the student checklist that students work with during this lesson.

- During the research reading share in Closing and Assessment A, work with individuals reviewing their independent reading journals to hold them accountable.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue to prepare their performance task for the Solution Symposium, which occurs in Lesson 14.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Print and assemble the Model Performance Task. Make the flip-down visual out of slides 1 and 2 by attaching the two sheets at the bottom and then hanging on the wall. Alternatively, project the slides to ensure all students can see the details on the visual, but be clear with the students that they are not creating a slide presentation for this task.

- Prepare for modeling the Model Performance Task symposium presentation. Consider asking a student in advance to act as a guest to ask the presentation prompts after the presentation of the flip-down visual.

- Consider how to engage and sustain effort and persistence throughout the lesson, as students will not be formally assessed on their performance task presentations. Remind students of the many real-world applications of effective public speaking skills. Focus students on the joy of learning for learning’s sake.

- Gather art supplies and computers/tablets students will need to create their visuals (see Materials list).

- Review the student tasks and example answers to get familiar with what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Prepare copies of handouts for students, including the entrance ticket (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time A: Prepare technology to show model—for example, a projector or an interactive board.

- Work Time B: Prepare materials and technology for students to locate images for their visuals if they do not want to create their own. Choose the level of technology that is appropriate for the students and school resources, and guide students accordingly.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.6.10 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 11**. Students may need to reference the **Performance Task: Solution Symposium**.

- Save these entrance tickets for students to reference again in Lesson 13.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Analyze Model Performance Task – SL.6.2 (15 minutes)

- Distribute and display the **Presentation checklist**. Remind students they used this checklist during their presentations in Module 1. Review the characteristics as needed.

- Instruct students to listen to the model presentation and put a checkmark next to any of the criteria they notice in the presentation. They should be prepared to share these observations after the presentation.

- Model the performance task materials and presentation using the **Model Performance Task** or with another sample from a previous class. Do not distribute a copy to students yet, to maintain focus on the model presentation.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What characteristics did you notice during the presentation? What specifically can you point to from the presentation that meets that criteria?” (Appropriate eye contact, adequate volume, and clear pronunciation.)

- Clarify what is meant by “clear pronunciation.” Remind all students that the goal is understandable speech, and that this may look and sound different for different students. ▲

- Distribute the Model Performance Task handout. Focus students on the **Performance Task anchor chart**.

- Instruct students to work with a partner to examine the printout of the Model Performance Task for the criteria listed on the Performance Task anchor chart. They should be prepared to share these observations after the presentation.

- Ask:

“What characteristics on the anchor chart do you see done well in the model? What evidence from the model supports your thinking?” (Responses will vary.)

“Based on what you see in the model, what kind of images and information will you need in order to be able to create a presentation like this?” (Something that represents the problem, something that represents the solution, and talking notes.)

- Field any outstanding questions about the specifics of the presentation if needed. Explain they are now going to start creating their flip-down visual.

- Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target, using a checking for understanding technique. Scan student responses and make a note of students who might need support. Check in with them moving forward.

For Lighter Support

- As students analyze the Model Performance Task during Work Time A, strategically use Goal 3 Conversation Cues to help students deepen their thinking surrounding the presentation of information in the model: “Can you figure out why information is presented in this way? I’ll give you time to think and discuss with a partner.”

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time A, students who need heavier support may feel overwhelmed by the amount of information presented on the model presentation prompts. Remind them that this model is meant to provide multiple examples of the kinds of answers presenters can give and that they are not expected to answer questions in this much detail during their own presentations. Invite small groups of students who need heavier support to isolate and focus on one or two bullets and then share their learning with other groups.

Work Time

B. Prepare Performance Task Visual – SL.6.5 (15 minutes)

- Invite students to retrieve the following materials:

- Performance Task: Solution Symposium

- **Design Solution: Research note-catcher**

- **Problem-Solution essay**

- Model Performance Task

- Presentation checklist

- Read-aloud or ask a student to read-aloud the sections labeled “Before the Symposium” and “Flip-Down Visual” of Performance Task: Solution Symposium.

- Explain that in today’s lesson they are going to start designing the visual representing the problem and/or solution described in their essays. Remind them to use the model and the Performance Task anchor chart as they create their own.

- Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**. Draw their attention to the habit of character *initiative*. Remind students of what this means and what it looks like (I see what needs to be done and take the lead on making responsible decisions; doing things without being asked).

- Encourage students to think creatively when designing their visuals. They may choose to draw their problem and its solution, or they may be more comfortable using a computer program to create a diagram or making a collage of images found online. Students may even wish to have something physical (like a model) that guests can touch or hold. The visuals are meant to help guests better understand the problems and solutions described, but how they are done is up to students.

- Provide students with art supplies they may need to create their visuals, such as **blank paper**, **construction paper**, **colored pencils or markers**, **scissors**, and/or **computers or tablets**.

- Direct students to websites where they can access free, high-quality stock photos and clip art, such as http://eled.org/0181 or http://eled.org/0147.

- As students work, circulate to answer questions, push their thinking, and provide support as needed. Remind them to review the model and the anchor chart to help them make decisions and to also use one another as thought-partners.

Closing and Assessment

A. Independent Research Reading Share – RI.6.10 (10 minutes)

- Refer to the **Independent Reading Sample Plans** to guide students through a research reading share, or use another routine.

- Remind students that the purpose of research reading is to build their content knowledge, domain-specific vocabulary, and achievement on reading complex texts. As necessary, use the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart** to review *integrity*.

- After 7 minutes, direct students to complete **QuickWrite: Reading and Research Connections**. Invite them to review the **Work to Contribute to a Better World anchor chart** as needed.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Solution Symposium Preparation

- Students continue to prepare the graphics for their performance task visual.
