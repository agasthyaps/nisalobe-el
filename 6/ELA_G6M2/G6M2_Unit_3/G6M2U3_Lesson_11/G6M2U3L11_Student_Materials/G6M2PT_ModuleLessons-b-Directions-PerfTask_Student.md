Performance Task: Solution Symposium

RI.6.7, RI.6.10, W.6.7, W.6.8, SL.6.1, SL.6.2, SL.6.4, SL.6.5, SL.6.6

**Name:** **Date:**

You uncovered a critical problem. You researched a design-solution. Now, you’ll share your learning with others during a **Solution Symposium**!

**What is a Solution Symposium?**

**sym-po-si-um:** a formal meeting or conference, where experts discuss a particular subject

The subject of <u>our</u> symposium is “critical problems and their design-solutions,” and the experts are . . . <u>you</u>! Each of you will create a visual representation on paper of the problem and design-solution that you researched for your essays. Guests will visit your “station” and you will present your problem and solution, using your visuals to help you explain. When you are the visitor at a station, you will use a note-catcher to record the key details from your peers’ presentations.

**Before the Symposium**

Use the information you gathered for your Problem-Solution essay to prepare for the Solution Symposium. You might have to conduct additional research to gather images or other graphics for your presentation materials.

**Flip-Down Visual**

The flip-down visual will contain two sections: one for the problem and one for the solution. You will create each section using visuals, such as illustrations, diagrams, collages, as well as text.

Memorize your explanations of the problem and solution or put them on notecards to use during the symposium.

Practice incorporating your flip-down visual into your presentation, making sure that your audience cannot see the solution until you have described the problem and given them a chance to brainstorm possible solutions.

**Presentation Prompts**

Guests will be given two specific questions to ask after your presentation. Prepare and rehearse your responses.

- How was design thinking used to solve this problem?

- How were habits of character used to solve this problem?

**During the Symposium**

Guests will walk from station to station, interacting with each presenter. Whenever someone new comes to your station, follow these steps:

1.  First, welcome your guests, introduce yourself, and describe the problem you researched. The top of your visual should cover the solution underneath.

2.  Ask the guests to guess one or two possible solutions to the problem.

3.  Flip down the top layer (the problem) of the visual to reveal the bottom layer (the solution). Explain the solution to the guest.

4.  Listen respectfully as the guest asks the presentation prompts: (1) **How was design thinking used to solve this problem?** and (2) **How were habits of character used to solve this problem?** Answer the questions one at a time.

5.  Offer each guest a sticky note on which to record their favorite insight they learned from your presentation. Thank your guests as they leave the sticky note with you and move on to the next station. Get ready for your next guest, and the process starts again!

**Your participation in the Solution Symposium will include the following elements:**

- Relevant text information to describe the problem you researched.

- A clear explanation of the design-solution you researched.

- An artful flip-down visual that depicts the problem and the solution.

- Carefully organized text and visuals to guide guests through your presentation.

- Thoughtful responses about how design thinking and habits of character were used to solve your problem.

- The ability to repeat your presentation as new guests arrive at your station, improving or adapting as needed.
