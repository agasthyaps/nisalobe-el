Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- L.6.3a – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they deconstruct a complex sentence and rewrite it as two simpler sentences without changing the original meaning.

- W.6.2b – Work Time A: Students analyze the first Proof Paragraph of the model essay, which develops a topic with relevant facts, information, and examples.

- W.6.2b – Work Time B: Students participate in a Language Dive in which they explore a key sentence from the first Proof Paragraph of the model essay, noting ways in which the sentence develops the essay’s topic with important information and relevant facts.

- W.6.2c – Work Time B: Students participate in a Language Dive in which they examine the way in which a sentence supports a transition between the description of a problem and the description of its solution.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time C: Students collaborate to draft the first Proof Paragraph of their problem-solution essays, using textual evidence to support their analysis.

- RI.6.7 – Work Time C: Students integrate information collected from different media to inform the first Proof Paragraphs of their collaborative problem-solution essays.

- W.6.2b – Work Time C: Students collaborate to draft the first Proof Paragraph of their problem-solution essays, developing their topics with relevant information and examples.

- W.6.2c – Work Time C: Students incorporate transitions into the first Proof Paragraphs of their problem-solution essays in order to clarify relationships across ideas.

- W.6.4 – Work Time C: Students produce clear and coherent Proof Paragraphs, organized with attention to task, purpose, and audience.

- W.6.5 – Work Time C: With support from their partners, students develop and strengthen their writing by producing a collaborative draft of the first Proof Paragraph.

- W.6.8 – Work Time C: Students draft the first Proof Paragraphs of their problem-solution essays, quoting and paraphrasing information they have gathered from multiple sources.

- SL.6.2 – Work Time C: Students interpret the information they have collected from diverse media and use it to explain how design thinking was used to solve a problem.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Challenge students to flesh out the Proof Paragraph 1 with more details and citations. Encourage students to pull information not just from the anchor text, but also from William’s TED Talks and the supplemental article, “William Kamkwamba’s Electric Wind.”

- Using a variety of vocabulary strategies, invite students to determine the meaning of the word *feasibility* as it is used in the model essay.

- Allow students to manipulate sentences from the model essay, trying different combinations to make simple and complex sentences.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lessons, students planned their collaborative essay using their writing planner and drafted their introduction. They build on those foundations in this lesson by drafting the first Proof Paragraph focused on the critical problems William faced.

Support All Students

- Note that there is a differentiated version of the entrance ticket used in Opening A in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- This lesson involves multiple transitions between activities. Use alerts and previews to help learners anticipate and prepare for changes in activities.

- After closely analyzing the model, ELLs may understand the general structural elements of a problem-solution essay but still struggle to produce one in their own words. A Language Dive in this lesson offers a replicable structure that students can use in their own problem-solution essays to explain what makes their chosen problems critical. ▲

- A topic involving a problem and a solution allows opportunities for physical engagement. Invite students to “act out” the problem and solution being described in their essays. Known as embodied cognition, research demonstrates that the body influences the mind just as the mind influences the body.

- To support ELLs, this lesson features a Language Dive that helps students analyze the structure and function of a key sentence in Proof Paragraph 1 of the Model Problem-Solution Essay: “Bridges to Prosperity.” By elucidating what exactly makes the problem of the essay critical, this sentence serves as an important link between the problem and solution paragraphs. The Language Dive prepares students to produce a sentence with a similar structure to use in their own problem-solution essays during the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment. This direct applicability is key for ELLs, who may have less formulaic language to draw from in their academic writing.

- ELLs may find it challenging to interpret some of the more complex vocabulary in Proof Paragraph 1 of the model essay. If students are using the Model Problem-Solution Essay: “Bridges to Prosperity” ▲, allow them time to review the glossary for keywords in the paragraph. As needed, invite them to annotate the paragraph with simple translations in their home languages.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.4, 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.7, 6.I.C.10, 6.I.C.11, 6.I.C.12, 6.II.A.1, 6.II.A.2, 6.II.B.3, 6.II.B.4, 6.II.B.5, 6.II.C.6, and 6.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- Consider using the Grade 6 Writing Process checklist to assess students’ writing abilities in Work Time C (see the Tools Page at http://eled.org/tools).

Down the Road

- Students will continue to draft their collaborative essay, focusing next on Proof Paragraph 2, the solution.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Consider creating strategic partnerships or groups for work during Closing and Assessment A.

- Prepare Language Dive sentence chunk strips.

- Gather colored pencils for annotation work during the Language Dive.

- Preview the Language Dive Guide and consider how to encourage conversation among students to address the questions and goals suggested under each sentence chunk strip. Select from the questions and goals provided to best meet students’ needs.

- Review the student tasks and example answers to get familiar with what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Prepare copies of handouts for students, including the entrance ticket (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time A: Display and replay the TED Talk: Avery Bang: “Building Bridges and Connecting Communities,” setting a new purpose for each viewing. For this lesson, ask students to listen specifically for the information that should be included in the problem paragraph.

- Work Time A: Display the model essay on a large screen and digitally cut out or cross out the sentences highlighted in this section of the lesson to help students understand how each sentence contributes to the paragraph.

- Work Time C: Students may prefer to complete their note-catchers in a word-processing document using speech-to-text facilities activated on devices or using an app or software such as http://eled.org/0103.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.6.3a (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 4** or optional **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 4** ▲. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 4 (example for teacher reference)** for possible responses.

- Using a total participation technique, ask:

“Why might writers simplify complex sentences as you did on the entrance ticket?” (To vary their sentence structure. To add interest and keep each sentence from sounding repetitive. To make the writing more logical or easier to follow.)

- Explain that, as writing partners continue to draft their collaborative essays, they should be aware of their sentence structure and look for ways to make variations.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as in previous lessons.

- Focus students on the **Habits of Character anchor charts** and invite them to read them to themselves. Direct students to choose a habit of character to focus on as they work today.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- During Opening A, invite students who need heavier support to use the Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 4 ▲. This resource features sentence starters to help them effectively deconstruct and rewrite a complex sentence as multiple simpler sentences.

Work Time

A. Analyze a Model: Proof Paragraph 1 – W.6.2b (10 minutes)

- Ask students to retrieve their **Model Problem-Solution Model Essay: “Bridges to Prosperity.”**

- Move students into writing partners. Review the focus from the introduction of the model essay, including the problem and the solution identified.

- Invite students to chorally read, with their partner, the first body paragraph of the model essay.

- Turn and Talk:

“What do you notice about this paragraph?” (It is all focused around the problem. It contains evidence from multiple research sources.)

- Point out that the body paragraphs have been labeled with headings to support the reader in understanding the main idea of each paragraph.

- Explain that the author has provided evidence to support her first point and then elaborated on the evidence presented. This elaboration explains how the innovator responded to the problem.

- Direct students to read the first Proof Paragraph again leaving out the first three sentences (“The problem for . . . ” through “ . . . any way they can.”)

- Turn and Talk, cueing students to challenge their thinking:

“What if the writer had not included this information? How would that change the reader’s understanding of this topic?” (There would not be enough context to understand the problem and why it is critical.)

- Draw students’ attention to the information in parentheses— *Bang* and *“Bridges to Prosperity.”*

- Ask:

“What information is contained in these parentheses?” (The source from where this information was found.)

“Why does the author include the source information?” (To prove that the information is reliable and credible. To demonstrate that information was drawn from multiple outside sources. To point readers to resources where they can find out more, if they are interested.)

- Direct students to read the first Proof Paragraph again leaving out the last two sentences (“In this way . . . ” through “ . . . ideas for solutions.”)

- Turn and Talk:

“What if the writer had not included this information? How would that change the reader’s understanding of the topic?” (The paragraph would just end without a logical segue into the next paragraph. It would not make a connection to design thinking and would not demonstrate that an innovator worked to create a solution to the problem described.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

B. Language Dive: Model Problem-Solution Essay: “Bridges to Prosperity,” Proof Paragraph 1 – W.6.2c (10 minutes)

- Tell students they will now participate in a Language Dive to analyze a key sentence from Proof Paragraph 1 of the Model Problem-Solution Essay: “Bridges to Prosperity” and study the way that it connects key ideas in the essay. Distribute **colored pencils (yellow, green, blue, and red)** to each student.

- Reread aloud the excerpt from the Model Problem-Solution Essay: “Bridges to Prosperity” starting at “The problem for many isolated communities is that . . . ” in Proof Paragraph 1 and ending with “Increasing ‘connectivity’ (connecting people to basic resources) is the immediate problem that B2P is working to solve.”

- Focus students on the sentence:

- “This is a critical problem because one in seven people cannot safely access the services and products they need to survive (Bang).”

- Use the **Language Dive Guide: Model Problem-Solution Essay: “Bridges to Prosperity,” Proof Paragraph 1** to guide students through a Language Dive conversation about the sentence. Distribute and display the **Language Dive Guide: Model Problem-Solution Essay: “Bridges to Prosperity,” Proof Paragraph 1 note-catcher**, and the **Language Dive Guide: Model Problem-Solution Essay: “Bridges to Prosperity,” Proof Paragraph 1 sentence chunk strips**. Refer to the **Language Dive: Model Problem-Solution Essay: “Bridges to Prosperity,” Proof Paragraph 1 note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- Develop an extension to the Language Dive of Work Time B that invites students to explore an alternative focus structure from the sentence “the services and products **they need to survive.** ” Students who need lighter support may benefit from a mini lesson highlighting precisely when relative pronouns can be omitted. Help students understand that, if a relative pronoun is immediately followed by a verb or verb phrase, then the relative pronoun is a subject and it cannot be omitted. However, if it is immediately followed by a noun, it is an object, and it *can* be omitted. Provide multiple examples to support students’ understanding of the distinction. For an added challenge, provide example sentences with students before sharing the grammatical rules and invite them to deduce the rule from the sentence patterns. Some examples follow below:

- Here’s the book \[that\] I want to read (object; can be omitted).

- I prefer games that are more competitive (subject; cannot be omitted).

For Heavier Support

- Develop an extension to the Language Dive of Work Time B that invites students to explore an alternative focus structure from the sentence “the services and products **they need to survive.** ” Students who need heavier support may need a mini lesson highlighting the role of relative clauses in a sentence. Share simple examples of other restrictive relative clauses with the omitted relative pronoun *that* and work with students to interpret them and locate structural patterns. Some examples follow below:

- Here’s the book \[that\] I want to read.

- My sister saw the movie \[that\] you were talking about.

- That is the only thing \[that\] I ate today.

Work Time

C. Collaborative Writing: Draft Proof Paragraph 1 – W.6.2b (15 minutes)

- Display and invite students to retrieve their **Problem-Solution Writing Planner: William** and their copy of the **Informative Writing checklist**. Point out the following characteristic on the checklist:

“W.6.2b: I use relevant facts, definitions, details, quotations and examples to explain my thinking.”

- Ask:

“Are there any specific criteria you should be aware of and list in the second column on the checklist?” (The essay contains relevant examples from both the TED Talk and my additional research sources.)

- As students share out, capture their responses in the Characteristics of This Informative Essay column as needed. Refer to the **Informative Writing checklist (example for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Explain that, in this lesson, students will work with their writing partner to draft Proof Paragraph 1, the problem paragraph of the problem-solution essay focused on William Kamkwamba. Students should base their draft on the information they gathered and organized on their **Design Solution: William note-catcher** and Problem-Solution Writing Planner: William. Students should label the first Proof Paragraph with an appropriate heading as shown in the model.

- Distribute **lined paper** or **devices**, and invite writing partners to begin.

- Circulate and monitor, referencing the following resources as necessary:

- **Design-Solution: William note-catcher (example for teacher reference)**

- **Problem Solution Writing Planner: William (example for teacher reference)**

- **Problem-Solution Essay: William (example for teacher reference)**

- With two minutes remaining, refocus students and allow time for them to log off devices or put away materials.

- Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target, using a checking for understanding technique. Scan student responses, and make a note of students who might need support. Check in with them moving forward.

Closing and Assessment

A. Debrief Collaborative Writing Process – SL.6.1b (5 minutes)

- Separate writing partners and create new partnerships for this activity.

- Explain that working with a partner to accomplish a task has its benefits and its drawbacks. Reflecting on the process can help students strategize to determine best practices for working effectively and productively. Remind students that reflections, like any partner sharing, should be kind, helpful, and specific.

- Invite students to discuss the following three questions with their new partner:

“What is going well so far in the collaborative process?”

“What could be improved about the collaborative process?”

“What specific actions will I take to make these improvements?”

- Circulate and monitor, listening to see if there are any major issues that need to be addressed. Be sure, also, to celebrate the highlights of working with a partner. As needed, cue students to listen carefully to one another:

“Can you repeat what your partner said in your own words?”

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
