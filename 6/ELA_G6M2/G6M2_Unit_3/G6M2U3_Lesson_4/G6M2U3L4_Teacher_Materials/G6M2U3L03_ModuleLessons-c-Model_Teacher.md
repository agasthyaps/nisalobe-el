Imagine what it would be like to live without electricity. Now, imagine being a farmer who didn’t have a way to get water to your fields unless it rained. In 2001, a drought occurred in William Kamkwamba’s rural village in Malawi. William Kamkwamba was just 14 years old when he and his family lived through that drought. He decided he could help his family. As an eighth grader, William found a way to get the water his family needed. Helping to ensure his family’s survival was a complex problem, but, using design thinking, William was able to solve it.

**The Problem**

The problem for William’s family and others in his community was that electricity was rare, expensive, and unreliable. This was a critical problem because without electricity, William and his community were in danger of another drought and deadly famine. If they had electricity, farmers could pump water to irrigate their crops no matter what the weather. In the beginning of the design process, William went to the library. He always went there when he had questions and wanted to know how things worked. After seeing a water turbine in a science textbook and learning about magnets, motors, and currents, William noticed a new book. The cover included a picture of a row of windmills. “All I needed was a windmill . . . . With a windmill we’d finally release ourselves from the troubles of darkness and hunger. A windmill meant more than just power. It was freedom” (149–150). William continued to investigate and build on his previous tinkering with radios and other small electronics. Slowly, he built his understanding. In this way, William demonstrated the first steps in design thinking. He read books, asked questions, and researched to get ideas for solving this problem.

**The Solution**

It might seem like solving his problem was simple: build a windmill. However, the process of imagining, planning, creating, testing, and improving the solution was far from simple, especially for 14-year-old William. During the ”imagine” and “planning” phases, William ruled out the water turbine and realized a windmill was the solution. He then set out to build a prototype, a smaller version built from a body lotion container, PVC pipe, a motor from a radio, and a flip-flop. His prototype worked to power a radio! So, William created a large version out of PVC pipe, a shock absorber, bicycle frame, tractor fan, and dynamo (Kamkwamba, TED). Though the process was difficult, William was again successful. “I threw my hands into the air and shouted with joy, laughing so hard that I became dizzy” (200). Even after his windmill was working, William continued to make adjustments and revisions. He added a battery to store power for when it wasn’t windy. He replaced the bike chain with a real pulley and belt, and built a taller tower. “Finally, the dream had been accomplished. My family couldn’t have imagined that the little windmill I built during the famine would change their lives in every way, and they saw this change as a gift from heaven” (274). William had solved a critical problem using design thinking.

**Using Design Thinking to Build a Better World**

William used design thinking to a solve problem for his family by building a windmill that generated electricity, allowing them to irrigate their fields and improve their quality of life. William’s design thinking and his desire to make life better for his family and community didn’t stop with that one windmill. He now leads an organization called Moving Windmills. His organization designs energy, health, education, library, safety, farming, and housing projects. His windmill was just the beginning. William’s organization has made a profound impact on the lives of many people, not only his own family. William Kamkwamba uses design thinking to solve problems and contribute to a better world. He has modeled initiative, responsibility, perseverance, collaboration, empathy, integrity, respect, and compassion in all he does. Design thinking can not only solve problems, it can make us better people in the process!
