Language Dive Guide: Model Problem-Solution Essay: “Bridges to Prosperity,”  
Proof Paragraph 1

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

This is a critical problem **because one in seven people cannot safely access the services and products** they need to survive (Bang). (from Proof Paragraph 1 of the Model Problem-Solution Essay)

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the Daily Learning Target **(I can analyze the structure of the model essay problem paragraph)** and W.6.2b and W.6.2c by highlighting a key sentence that uses evidence from an informational text to help develop the topic of a model problem-solution essay. By explaining why a problem is critical, this sentence helps point to the need for a solution, supporting a transition between the problem and solution sections of the model essay. Supporting Standards: RI.6.1, W.6.8, SL.6.1, L.6.1d, L.6.3a.

- Guiding Question: The sentence helps students respond to the guiding question **(How can design thinking help solve a critical problem?)** by explaining why a problem described in the essay is critical.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it marks the transition between descriptions of a problem and its solution in a problem-solution essay, it includes a relative clause that provides more information about a key noun phrase, and it uses formulaic language (**This is a critical problem because \_\_\_\_**) that can be easily replicated for students’ own writing purposes. Also, the sentence serves as an example of an effective paraphrase, and follows standard conventions for source attribution by including a citation for the paraphrased information in parentheses (**Bang**). Invite students to discuss each chunk briefly, but encourage extended conversation and practice with the focus structure: **because one in seven people cannot safely access the services and products**. Based on student need and time, consider adding days for extended conversation and practice with a new focus structure: **they need to survive**.

- Practice and Transfer: After discussing the focus structure, students practice using it to discuss something in their lives. Students transfer their understanding of the meaning and structure of this sentence when describing critical problems in their own problem-solution essays during the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment. An extension to this Language Dive, inviting students to develop their understanding of when and why to omit relative pronouns from relative clauses, is described in Lesson 3 of this guide.

Deconstruct

- Invite students to put their finger by this sentence from Proof Paragraph 1 of the Model Problem-Solution Essay on their note-catchers: **This is a critical problem <u>because one in seven people cannot safely access the services and products</u> they need to survive (Bang).**

- Read aloud the sentence twice, and then ask students to take turns reading the sentence aloud with their partners.

- Say:

“What does this sentence mean to you?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“How does this sentence add to your understanding of the guiding question, ‘How can design thinking help solve a critical problem?’” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

This is a critical problem

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following sentence chunk strip: **This is a critical problem**

- Say:

“What does this chunk tell us?” (It clearly states that a critical problem exists, and it prepares us for further explanation.)

- Underline This in yellow, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 

- Say:

“What critical problem is This referring to?” (Rivers separate isolated communities from work, school, and health services, and there is no way to safely cross them. As needed, encourage students to scan the introduction paragraph of the essay to locate this answer.)

“Why do you think this is a critical problem?” (Responses may vary, but look for students to point out that people might not be able to take care of themselves or their families without risking their safety.)

because one in seven people cannot safely access the services and products

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **because one in seven people cannot safely access the services and products**

- Underline the conjunction because in green, and invite students to do the same on their note-catchers. 

- Say:

“What does the word because tell us about the relationship between this chunk and the previous chunk?” (This chunk is explaining why the previous chunk is true; this chunk gives a reason.)

- Underline the noun phrase one in seven people in blue, and invite students to do the same on their note-catchers. 

- Say:

“How many people is one in seven? If we said one in seven people in this classroom, how many people would that be?” (Responses will vary depending on the class size.)

- Point out that the chunk is referring to **one in seven people** in the entire world. The world population is over 7 billion, which puts this figure at over 1 billion—that’s a 1 followed by nine zeroes!

- If time allows, consider inviting students to depict the phrase **one in seven** visually on their note-catchers (e.g., by sketching seven stick-figures and coloring or circling one of them). 

- Say:

“Where is the verb in this chunk? How do you know it is a verb?” (Access; it is preceded by the modal cannot, it is modified by the adverb safely, and it follows a noun phrase.)

- Underline access in red, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 

- Say:

“What’s another way to say access?” (Be able to use, enter, or get near something.)

- Underline services and products in blue, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 

“What is the difference between services and products?” (Services generally involve action, while products are tangible.)

“What other questions do you have about these services and products?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to wonder about which services and products the sentence is describing.)

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Display the sentence frame: **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is/are my favorite food because \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

(independent clause + conjunction + independent clause)

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use this frame to explain why you love your favorite food. Use your own words with your partners.”

they need to survive

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **they need to survive**.

- As needed, remind students that this is called a relative clause and that the purpose of relative clauses is to add more information to a noun or noun phrase. They are often used to answer the question, “Which \[noun\]?” In this case, the relative clause answers the question, “Which products and services?” “The ones people need to survive.”

- Say:

“What are some services and products that people need to survive?” (Doctors’ visits, food and water, clothing to keep them warm.)

- To support student understanding of relative clauses, consider using your hand to cover the relative clause **they need to survive**.

- Say:

“How would removing this relative clause change our understanding of the critical problem?” (We would not know which services and products the sentence was referring to; we would not understand why the services and products were so important; we might not understand that this is an issue of survival, which makes it very critical.)

(Bang).

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **(Bang).**

- Say:

“Whom is this chunk referring to?” (Avery Bang, the innovator behind Bridges to Prosperity.)

“Why is her last name in parentheses?” (Because the information in the sentence comes from her TED Talk.)

“Why doesn’t this sentence use quotation marks?” (Because the sentence does not directly quote Avery; instead, it paraphrases information from the text.)

This is a critical problem because one in seven people cannot safely access the services and products they need to survive (Bang).

Reconstruct

- Point to and read the entire sentence on display: **This is a critical problem <u>because one in seven people cannot safely access the services and products</u> they need to survive (Bang).**

- Say:

“What kind of information came before this sentence in the Model Problem-Solution Essay?” (A description of the problem.)

“What kind of information do you think will come after this sentence in the essay?” (Further explanation of the problem; description of a solution.)

- Say:

“Is it possible to remove the conjunction because and write this as multiple sentences?” (This is grammatically possible because there are enough nouns and verbs to form multiple sentences.)

- If time allows, invite students to practice separating this sentence into multiple sentences. Examples of this may include the following: This is a critical problem. One in seven people cannot safely access services and products. They need these to survive.

“Can you figure out why the writer chose to include all of this information in a single sentence?” (Responses may vary, but look for students to understand that this is a key sentence in the essay. It clarifies precisely why the problem discussed in the essay is critical. Including all of this information in a single, well-crafted sentence is good practice for problem-solution essays because it helps the reader understand exactly what the problem is and why it matters.)

“How can a sentence like this one help you to connect ideas in your own problem-solution essays?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to understand that this sentence helps the reader understand the importance of the problem and why a solution is necessary.)

“What other questions can we ask that will help us understand this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question how can design thinking help solve a critical problem?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to understand that this sentence provides a clear rationale for describing the problem of the essay as critical.)

Practice

- Display the sentence and sentence frame:

> **Around the world, 1.3 billion people do not have electricity. This is a critical  
> problem because** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

independent clause

(independent clause + conjunction + independent clause)

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Around the world, 1.3 billion people do not have electricity. That’s also about one in seven people. Use this frame to talk about why this is a critical problem. If it helps, think about what people cannot do without electricity. Use your own words with your partners.”
