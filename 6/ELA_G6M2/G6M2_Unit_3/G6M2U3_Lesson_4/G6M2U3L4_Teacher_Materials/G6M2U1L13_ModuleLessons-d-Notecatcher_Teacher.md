(For Teacher Reference)

Part I: Research Details

**Directions:** Use the organizer below to gather relevant information from the texts. Answer the guiding questions and detail how the stages of design process were evident in William’s movement from problem to solution. Refer to the Design Thinking graphic as needed. (RI.6.1, RI.6.7, W.6.8, SL.6.2)

**Note:** This is a sample of possible content. Students do not need to include all of these facts on their own note-catchers.
