Collaborative Essay

W.6.10, SL.6.3, SL.6.4

**Name:** **Date:**

**Directions:** You and your partner will be grouped with another pair who wrote about the other hidden figure for their collaborative essay. You will collaboratively complete this note-catcher while listening to their collaborative presentation of their essay.

Note: We will use this procedure again in Lesson 10 after writing your individual argument essays and then again during the End of Unit 3 Assessment presentations of the performance task.
