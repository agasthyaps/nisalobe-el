Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- SL.6.3 – Work Time A: Students delineate the arguments and specific claims presented by their classmates.

- SL.6.4 – Work Time A: Students present their arguments and claims to peers, sequencing their ideas logically; using relevant descriptions, facts, and details to highlight main ideas; and demonstrating appropriate eye contact, adequate volume, and clear pronunciation.

- SL.6.4 – Work Time B: Students give feedback to their peers about their presentation of their arguments and claims. Their feedback may include comments about the speakers’ logically sequenced ideas; their use of relevant descriptions, facts, and details to highlight main ideas; or their general presentation skills, including eye contact, volume, and pronunciation.

- SL.6.1d – Closing and Assessment A: Students participate in a discussion to review and reflect upon key learning from the Mary and Katherine argument essays.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners, persevering as they read and analyze a new text with partners.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Several words on the Present and Delineate Argument: Collaborative Essay note-catcher are reviewed during the lesson. Extend this work with vocabulary by also reviewing the meaning of *accentuate* from Part 1 of the activity. Encourage students to use different strategies to determine the meaning, to connect it to the work being done in this lesson, and to use it in their own sentences.

- Students who chose to complete the anchor text in its entirety and read about the fourth hidden figure, Christine Darden, should be encouraged to make connections to her work during the reflection discussion in Closing and Assessment A.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Students have been collaborating with a partner to write an argument essay focused on a hidden figure featured in the anchor text, either Mary Jackson or Katherine Johnson. In this lesson, partners pair up with a group who wrote their essay on a different individual to delineate the arguments and specific claims presented by their classmates.

Support All Students

- The Peer Assessment task of Work Time A invites students to evaluate their classmates’ presentations and identify general stars and steps. Some students might focus on presentation-related skills like pronunciation, which could feel threatening or alienating for ELLs, especially those who feel self-conscious about the way their English sounds. As needed, remind the whole group that “clear pronunciation” does not mean accent-free speech and that, as a matter of fact, accent-free speech does not exist! Everyone speaks with an accent, and accents are an important part of who we are. Provide suggestions and examples for evaluating presentations that do not disadvantage ELLs; for example, focus on logical sequence of ideas, eye contact, or enunciation. ▲

- Review the directions for the Present and Delineate Argument activity several times to ensure clarity. Remove extra rows or columns on the assignment matrix for students who may be overwhelmed by too much information.

- To support ELLs, this lesson guides students through an activity in which they present and delineate the arguments that they developed in their collaborative essays. Presenting their own arguments and interpreting their peers’ arguments prepares students to produce effective arguments in their independent argument essays. This multi-modal activity also combines speaking, listening, and writing; recognizing and maximizing connections across language skills is especially supportive of ELLs. Direct vocabulary instruction during Work Time A supports students’ understanding of key vocabulary terms on the note-catchers they use during the present and delineate activity.

- ELLs may find it challenging to delineate the arguments presented by their peers, as this activity requires listening and taking notes simultaneously. If productive, consider offering a jigsaw-like variation of the task at first. When listening to the first presenter, students can work in pairs to take notes (i.e., with one student taking notes on the accomplishment and the reasons presented and the other taking notes on evidence and reasoning) and then share them to complete the note-catcher. With the second presenter, students who need heavier support can either swap responsibilities or work independently without jigsaw support.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.4, 6.I.B.5, 6.I.B.7, 6.I.B.8, 6.I.C.9, 6.I.C.12, 6.II.A.2, 6.II.B.3, 6.II.B.4, 6.II.B.5, 6.II.C.6, and 6.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- During Work Time A, circulate among the groups, and use the appropriate Speaking and Listening Checklist (informal assessment) to formatively assess at least half of the students during this lesson for their ability to present an argument (SL.6.4). There is another opportunity to formatively assess the remaining students during Lesson 10, prior to the end of unit assessment in Lessons 15–16. Students can also be formatively assessed on SL.6.3 in this lesson by collecting and reviewing their completed Present and Delineate Argument: Collaborative Essay handout.

- During Closing and Assessment A, use the Speaking and Listening checklist (informal assessment) to formatively assess SL.6.1d. There is another opportunity to formatively assess any remaining students during Lesson 10, prior to the end of unit assessment in Lesson 17.

- Encourage students to apply what they learn from this lesson about effective arguments as they plan and write their independent argument essay for the mid-unit assessment.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students continue their research about their focus figure for their independent essay. They also share their learning from their independent reading research work.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare the groups for this lesson by pairing one Mary pair with one Katherine pair.

- Review the directions for the Present and Delineate Argument activity several times to ensure clarity. Choose students with whom to model the process. Display the groupings on chart paper or on an external monitor.

- Review the student tasks and example answers to get familiar with what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Prepare copies of handouts for students, including entrance ticket (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time A: Use recording technology to capture all students presenting. Recordings can then be accessed later by the students for self-assessment and reflection and/or for formative assessment after the lesson ends.

- Work Times A and B: Students can complete the Present and Delineate Argument: Collaborative Essay handout using an online word-processing tool, such as http://eled.org/0158, if preferred over handwritten notes.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.6.8 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as in previous lessons to distribute and review the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 5**. Students will need to have their **Collaborative Argument Essays** they completed for homework and during the previous lessons. They may also refer to the **Argument Writing checklist** for assistance.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as in previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons. Invite students to choose a habit of character focus for themselves for this lesson.

Work Time

A. Present and Delineate Argument – SL.6.3, SL.6.4 (20 minutes)

- Review the learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can present my argument about why Mary’s or Katherine’s accomplishments were remarkable.”

“I can delineate my peers’ arguments about why Mary’s or Katherine’s accomplishments were remarkable.”

- Distribute and display the **Present and Delineate Argument: Collaborative Essay** handout. Review the directions.

- Point to the word *delineate*.

- Ask:

“What root word to you see within this word?” (line)

“What part of speech is *delineate*? What part of speech is *delineation*? Use the suffixes to help you.” (*Delineate* is a verb; *delineation* is a noun.)

- Turn and Talk:

“Using the root word, the part of speech, and the context, how might you define *delineate*?” (to line things up in an orderly way)

- Invite one student to check the preliminary definition of *delineate* in a **print or online dictionary** (to sketch something out; to describe or portray in precise or vivid detail).

- Ask:

“Using our new understanding of the word *delineate*, explain how it pertains to the work we are doing in this activity.” (We are sketching out or describing in detail in an orderly way all of the parts of an argument our partners used in their essays.)

- Add *delineate* to the **academic word wall** as students add them to their **vocabulary logs**.

- Post the groupings, and direct students to find their group members. Clarify directions as needed. Direct them to begin the Present and Delineate Argument: Collaborative Essay task.

- As students work, circulate to informally assess the students as noted in the assessment guidance note above. Aim to listen in to at least half of the students during this lesson, if possible. Remind students to be mindful of time and to keep the rotation moving as they present and listen. Refer to the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart** as necessary, reminding students to show respect and compassion as they work with partners and evaluate their work.

- Refer to the **Collaborative Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer (example for teacher reference)** for examples of the types of responses students should be giving in their presentations and recording on their Present and Delineate Argument handouts.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- At the beginning of Work Time A, as students interpret the unfamiliar words on the Present and Delineate Argument: Collaborative Essay handout, invite students who need heavier support to use translation dictionaries to look up translations of the words in their home languages. Provide time as needed for students to add translations to their note-catchers and/or vocabulary logs.

Work Time

B. Share Peer Feedback – SL.6.4 (10 minutes)

- Direct students to share and discuss their feedback from listening to the presentations, including their stars and steps, with their group members.

- If students struggle to think of feedback, direct them to reference the Argument Writing checklist for ideas about what they should comment on. Prompt them with questions, such as “Do the reason and evidence support the main claim? Why or why not?” or “Was the relationship between the claim and reasons/evidence solid? How could it be improved?”

- Again, as students work, circulate to provide support or answer questions as needed. Refer to the **Work to Contribute to a Better World anchor chart** as necessary, reminding students to give kind, specific, and helpful feedback that helps their peers to grow.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Closing and Assessment

A. Reflection Discussion – SL.6.1d (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can paraphrase and reflect on our multiple perspectives about Mary’s and Katherine’s accomplishments.”

- Reconvene students, and facilitate a brief discussion in which they discuss the following questions:

“What did you notice about the different arguments about Mary and Katherine during today’s lesson?” (Responses will vary, but may include: The arguments about both women are similar. Both faced similar challenges in order to achieve amazing goals. There are more than two points that can be made to support the same argument—that each woman’s accomplishments were remarkable.)

“What did you learn about these two women and their experiences? What are some of the takeaways about these two women after today’s lesson?” (Responses will vary, but may include: Their work often relied on the design thinking process that we learned about in Module 3 to test, refine, and improve their work. Their accomplishments are remarkable on their own before even considering the racial and gender discrimination they faced. They likely did not think of themselves as remarkable at the time.)

“Why is it important that we know about these two women and the others from *Hidden Figures*?” (Responses will vary. Add pertinent answers to the Module Guiding Questions anchor chart under question 3: “Why is it important to study the accomplishments of the ‘hidden figures’ and of others whose stories have gone unrecognized?”)

- Use the **Grade 6 Speaking and Listening checklist (informal assessment)** to record students’ skills with paraphrasing and reflection (SL.6.1d). If you do not have the chance to formatively assess all of the students this time, there will be another opportunity in Lesson 10, before the end of unit assessment.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- During the reflection discussion of Closing and Assessment A, use strategic combinations of Conversation Cues to help students who need lighter support to expand the conversation and think about their own thinking:

- “Do you agree or disagree with what your classmate said?” (Goal 4)

- “Who can explain why your classmate came up with that response?” (Goal 4)

- “How is what \_\_\_\_\_ said different from what \_\_\_\_\_ said?” (Goal 3)

- “How does our discussion add to your understanding of the module guiding question?” (Goal 4)

For Heavier Support

- During the reflection discussion of Closing and Assessment A, use strategic combinations of Conversation Cues to help students who need heavier support to be understood and to understand others:

- “I’ll give you a minute to think.” (Goal 1)

- “Can you say more about that?” (Goal 1)

- “So, do you mean \_\_\_\_\_?”

- “Who can repeat what your classmate said?” (Goal 2)

- During the reflection discussion of Closing and Assessment A, students answer questions that connect to the module questions. To ensure that ELLs who need heavier support can access this thinking, consider alternative formats that incorporate more processing time or allow for private reflection (e.g., a Chalk Talk or a QuickWrite).

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
