Mid-Unit 3 Assessment: Write an Argument Essay

**Name:** **Date:**

**Argument Essay**

Beginning in Unit 2 and throughout this unit, you have worked with a partner to gather evidence and draft an argument essay about why either Mary Jackson’s or Katherine Johnson’s accomplishments are remarkable. You have also researched another hidden figure in space science, gathered evidence, and planned your own argument essay about why your focus figure’s accomplishments are remarkable. In the second half of this unit, you will use your research about the focus figure to compose one section of a children’s picture book celebrating all these incredible individuals.

In this two-day assessment, use your planner to draft the full argument essay to respond to the following prompt: **Why are my focus figure’s accomplishments remarkable?**

**REMEMBER:** A well-written argument essay

- introduces and clearly states your main claim,

- supports the main claim with clear points/reasons and evidence from the text,

- uses words and phrases to show the relationships among your claim and points/reasons,

- includes a conclusion that follows from the argument presented, and

- follows the rules of writing (spelling, punctuation, and grammar).

Use your writing planner to help guide your writing. Manage your time carefully so that you can do the following:

1.  Draft your introduction.

2.  Draft your first Proof Paragraph.

3.  Draft your second Proof Paragraph.

4.  Draft your conclusion.

5.  Use the Argument Writing checklist to revise and edit your draft.
