Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.6.3 – Opening A: Students analyze narrative nonfiction books for trends across titles and covers.

- W.6.5 – Opening A: With support and guidance from the teacher and their classmates, students plan the title and cover of the class picture book.

- W.6.3 – Work Time A: Students continue to draft their narrative nonfiction picture book pages, using effective narrative techniques.

- W.6.4 – Work Time A: Students work with their crewmates to develop clear and coherent writing with attention to task, purpose, and audience.

- SL.6.5 – Work Time A: Students continue develop illustrations to clarify information in their picture book pages.

- SL.6.4 – Work Time B: Students rehearse their performance task presentations. They practice delivering their claims, sequencing their ideas logically; using pertinent descriptions, facts, and details; and demonstrating effective presentation skills.

- SL.6.5 – Work Time B: Students rehearse their performance task presentations, referring to their illustrations to help clarify information.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners, collaborating with their crewmates, taking initiative, and showing responsibility as they continue drafting the text and illustrations for their performance task.

- Previous modules have given students a more formal opportunity to revise and edit their performance task products. In this module, the lessons have been written to embed revision and editing throughout the process.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Students can learn as much from non-examples as they do from exemplars. Invite some students to rehearse and present some non-examples of the presentation as a reminder of what not to do. Allow other students to watch and critique the presentations. Encourage humor to mitigate any anxiety students may be feeling on the eve of the End of Unit 3 Assessment.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Throughout the second half of this unit, students have worked in triads to compose the text and design the illustrations for their section of the class book on other hidden figures in space science. In this lesson, students finish their books and rehearse their presentations, keeping in mind the specific criterion on which they will be assessed—their ability to orally present their argument that their focus figure’s achievements are truly remarkable.

Support All Students

- Some students may feel nervous as they prepare and rehearse for the End of Unit 3 Assessment; this anxiety may be felt especially by ELLs, whose language abilities may make them feel uncomfortable speaking aloud for extended periods of time. Validate students’ feelings and concerns, if they come up. Remind students of how much they have prepared. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson provides substantial in-class time for students to rehearse their picture book presentations for the performance task. ELLs may find in-class presentations especially challenging and so are likely to benefit from the time to practice and prepare.

- ELLs may find it challenging or nerve-wracking to present their picture book pages aloud to classmates. Remind them that the purpose of today’s rehearsal and refinement time is to allow enough practice to calm the nerves. Consider working most closely with students who may need additional support with their speaking skills. Celebrate and emphasize stars and gently offer manageable steps that will improve the presentation overall (e.g., changes in posture, volume, or eye contact).

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.4, 6.I.B.5, 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.7, 6.I.C.9, 6.I.C.10, 6.I.C.12, 6.II.A.1, 6.II.A.2, 6.II.B.3, 6.II.B.4, 6.II.B.5, 6.II.C.6, and 6.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- In this lesson, students rehearse for the End of Unit 3 Assessment. Use the Speaking and Listening Informal Assessment: Presentation of Knowledge and Ideas checklist located on the Tools Page (http://eled.org/tools) to informally assess their presentations, using only the relevant categories.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students complete the End of Unit 3 Assessment, a two-part speaking and listening assessment. In Part I, student crews present the picture book pages that they produced for their performance task about the focus figures they researched. Students show the picture book pages, highlight the figure’s most important achievements, and convey their argument about why this person’s accomplishments are remarkable. Members of the audience provide feedback on their classmates’ presentations, delineating and assessing their argument, claims, reasoning, and evidence. In part 2, students participate in a final collaborative discussion to reflect on their learning throughout the module, revisit the module’s guiding questions, and reflect on the value of learning about multiple perspectives.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.6.3, W.6.5 (10 minutes)

- Lay out **several examples of narrative nonfiction picture books** from the Examples list on the **Characteristics of Narrative Nonfiction anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**. Invite students to choose two books to browse through. Inform students that they will be specifically focusing on the book covers and titles.

- Distribute two **sticky notes** to each student. Explain that as students browse through the books, they should record what they notice about the titles and covers of narrative nonfiction texts. Students can pass around their books to ensure they see several examples.

- Circulate and monitor as students browse. Push students to support their responses with examples from the texts (e.g., “Your sticky note says the titles often include subtitles that describe what the book is about. Can you show me some examples?”).

- Focus student attention on the **Characteristics of Narrative Nonfiction anchor chart**. Using a total participation technique, gather student responses to add to the anchor chart. Refer to the Characteristics of Narrative Nonfiction anchor chart (example for teacher reference) for guidance.

- Explain that each crew’s section will be compiled into a class book which will require a title with cover art. Using a total participation technique, invite students to share their ideas for the title and cover art. Determine who will be responsible for completing these parts of the book, though students should prioritize their crew’s section first.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as in previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons. Invite students to choose a habit of character focus for themselves for this lesson.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- If students have not had an opportunity to browse narrative nonfiction picture books written in their home languages, consider providing students with a list of titles and covers of these books (e.g., compiled through an online search) during Opening A. This list will support students in understanding common features of narrative nonfiction picture book titles and cover art, but does not require that the books actually be purchased.

Work Time

A. Draft Narrative Nonfiction Picture Book Pages – W.6.3, SL.6.5 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can finalize my narrative nonfiction text and accompanying visuals about my focus figure’s remarkable accomplishments.”

- Direct students to join their three-person crews. Ask students to retrieve their **Performance Task: Picture Book directions**.

- Focus students on step 3: “Present your crew’s pages of the picture book to the class, explaining why these particular achievements were highlighted.” Explain that students have one more work session before the assessment in the next lesson when they present their books. In this lesson, crews should be finalizing their pages of the picture book.

- Invite students to gather the following materials as needed:

- **Performance Task anchor chart for Module 4**

- **Independent Argument Evidence note-catcher**

- Characteristics of Narrative Nonfiction anchor chart

- Examples of narrative nonfiction picture books

- **Text:** *Hidden Figures (Picture Book)*

- Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**. Draw their attention to the habit of character *responsibility*. Remind students of what this means and what it looks like (this means I take ownership of my ideas, my work, my goals, and my actions).

- Provide students with **art supplies** they may need to create their illustrations, such as blank paper, construction paper, colored pencils or markers, and scissors, and **devices**.

- Direct students to websites where they can access free, high-quality stock photos and clip art, such as http://eled.org/0147 or http://eled.org/0181.

- Release crews to begin working.

- As students work, circulate to answer questions, push their thinking, and provide support as needed. Remind them to review the model picture books and the anchor chart to help them make decisions and to also use one another as thought-partners. Guide students to include the most effective and relevant information to demonstrate why the focus figure’s accomplishments were so remarkable.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

B. Rehearse Performance Task – SL.6.4, SL.6.5 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can practice my crew’s children’s books pages and argument about why my focus figure’s accomplishments are remarkable.”

“I can provide kind, specific, and helpful feedback to my peers to help them refine and improve their presentation.”

- Direct students to retrieve their **Performance Task Presentation checklist**.

- Group two crews, and direct them to take turns presenting their picture books, being sure to include all of the information on their checklists. The other crew should listen respectfully, using the checklist to prepare feedback.

- Focus students on the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart** before they share. Draw their attention to the habits of character of respect, empathy, and compassion, and remind them to keep these in mind as they work with their groups.

- Release crews to begin presenting and offering kind, specific, and helpful feedback.

- Once crews are done sharing, field any new questions about the specifics of the presentation and clarify the logistics of the next lesson, when they will present.

- Conclude by celebrating the students’ perseverance and initiative as they worked on creating their picture books and preparing their presentations for the End of Unit 3 Assessment.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- Before Work Time B, invite students to carefully review the language of SL.6.4, on which they will be assessed in the following lesson. Draw students’ attention to this part of the standard in particular: *use appropriate eye contact, adequate volume, and clear pronunciation*. Invite students who need lighter support to discuss these components of the standard and set goals for their presentations in the following lesson.

For Heavier Support

- Before Work Time B, invite students to carefully review the language of SL.6.4, on which they will be assessed in the following lesson. Draw students’ attention to this part of the standard in particular: *use appropriate eye contact, adequate volume, and clear pronunciation*. Invite students who need heavier support to use a translation dictionary to clarify the precise meanings of the words *appropriate* and *adequate*. Work with students to discuss what these components mean for them and their presentations.

- Before Work Time B, consider working with students who need heavier support to develop flashcards that they can use to help them rehearse. Students can create and use flashcards to help them remember the main points they wish to share. Encourage them to practice their presentations with their flashcards during Work Time B, and then practice again without them at home for homework in preparation for the presentations of the following lesson.

Closing and Assessment

A. Share Stars (5 minutes)

- Facilitate a quick round-robin sharing where each student shares something positive (a star) about the other crew’s picture book or rehearsal. For example, “Their illustrations are so artistic and creative!” or “The crew was really convincing. They gave a lot of evidence to show why their focus figure’s accomplishments were remarkable!”

- Conclude by celebrating the students’ perseverance and initiative as they worked on creating their picture book pages and preparing their presentations for the End of Unit 3 Assessment.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Rehearse Presentations

- Students rehearse for the End of Unit 3 Assessment presentation.
