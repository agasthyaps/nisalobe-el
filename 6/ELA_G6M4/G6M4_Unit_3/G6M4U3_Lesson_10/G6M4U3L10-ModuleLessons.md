Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- SL.6.3 – Work Time A: Students delineate the arguments and specific claims presented by their classmates.

- SL.6.4 – Work Time A: Students present their arguments and claims to peers, sequencing their ideas logically; using relevant descriptions, facts, and details to highlight main ideas; and demonstrating appropriate eye contact, adequate volume, and clear pronunciation.

- SL.6.4 – Work Time B: Students give feedback to their peers about their presentation of their arguments and claims, sequencing of ideas logically; using relevant descriptions, facts, and details to highlight main ideas; and demonstrating appropriate eye contact, adequate volume, and clear pronunciation.

- SL.6.1d – Closing and Assessment A: Students participate in a discussion to review and reflect upon key learning from the focus figure argument essays.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Students who chose to complete the anchor text in its entirety and read about the fourth hidden figure, Christine Darden, should be encouraged to make connections to her work during the reflection discussion in Closing and Assessment A.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Students have collaborated with a partner to write an argument essay focused on a hidden figure featured in the anchor text, either Mary Jackson or Katherine Johnson. They practiced presenting their own arguments and delineating and evaluating those of their groupmates. They then wrote an independent argument about the focus figure they researched. In this lesson, they present their independent arguments and delineate and evaluate their peers’ arguments.

Support All Students

- The Peer Assessment task of Work Time A invites students to evaluate their classmates’ presentations and identify general stars and steps. Some students might focus on presentation-related skills like pronunciation, which could feel threatening or alienating for ELLs, especially those who feel self-conscious about the way their English sounds. As needed, remind the whole group that “clear pronunciation” does not mean accent-free speech and that, as a matter of fact, accent-free speech does not exist! Everyone speaks with an accent, and accents are an important part of who we are. Provide suggestions and examples for evaluating presentations that do not disadvantage ELLs; for example, focus on logical sequence of ideas, eye contact, or enunciation. ▲

- Review the directions for the Present, Delineate, and Evaluate Argument activity several times to ensure clarity. Remove extra rows or columns on the assignment matrix for students who may be overwhelmed by too much information.

- To support ELLs, this lesson repeats a task from Lesson 5, in which students have the opportunity both to present an argument and delineate arguments presented by their classmates. This lesson features a gradual release of scaffolds: whereas in Lesson 5, students presented and delineated arguments collaboratively, students present and delineate arguments individually in this lesson. A gradual release of scaffolds increases the level of challenge incrementally, which reinforces learning and boosts ELLs’ confidence.

- As in Lesson 5, ELLs may find it challenging to delineate the arguments presented by their peers, especially without the support of their collaborative writing partners. Consider building additional time into Work Time A for students to ask clarifying questions of the presenter. This process will help ensure that ELLs understand their classmates’ arguments well enough to effectively delineate them.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.4, 6.I.B.5, 6.I.B.7, 6.I.B.8, 6.I.C.9, 6.I.C.12, 6.II.A.2, 6.II.B.3, 6.II.B.4, 6.II.B.5, 6.II.C.6, and 6.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- During Work Time A, circulate among the groups, and use the appropriate Speaking and Listening checklist (informal assessment) to formatively assess the students during this lesson for their ability to present an argument (SL.6.4) not already assessed during Lesson 5. Students can be formatively assessed on SL.6.3 in this lesson by collecting and reviewing their completed Present and Delineate Argument: Independent Essay handout.

- During Closing and Assessment A, use the Speaking and Listening checklist (informal assessment) to formatively assess SL.6.1d, especially for any students not assessed in Lesson 5.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students begin work on their performance task, working with their crewmates to create pages about their independent focus figures for a collaborative children’s book.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare the groups of four in advance. Ideally it would be good to mix the students so they are with three other students who researched a different focus figure than they did. Assign students to their roles as appropriate, rather than having them choose once in their groups.

- Also prepare the presentation order for each of the groups, and who will delineate for each presenter. Post this for student use during the lesson.

- Review the directions for the Present and Delineate Argument activity several times to ensure clarity. Choose students with whom to model the process. Display the groupings on chart paper or on an external monitor.

- Review the instructions for the Walk and Talk activity in Closing and Assessment A. Prepare music to play while students are mingling about the classroom.

- Review the student tasks and example answers to get familiar with what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Prepare copies of handouts for students, including entrance ticket (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time A: Use recording technology to capture all students presenting. Recordings can then be accessed later by the students for self-assessment and reflection and/or for formative assessment after the lesson ends.

- Work Times A and B: Students can complete the Present and Delineate Evaluate Argument: Independent Essay handout using an online tool such as http://eled.org/0158 if preferred over handwritten notes.

- Closing and Assessment A: Set up a device for playing music during the Walk and Talk activity.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.6.8 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as in previous lessons to distribute and review the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 10**. Direct students to sit with their writing partner. Students will also need to have their **Independent Argument Essays**, completed during the previous lessons. They can also refer to the **Argument Writing checklist** for assistance.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as in previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons. Invite students to choose a habit of character focus for themselves for this lesson.

Work Time

A. Present and Delineate Argument – SL.6.3, SL.6.4 (20 minutes)

- Review the learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can present an argument about why my focus figure’s accomplishments were remarkable.”

“I can delineate my peers’ arguments about why their focus figure’s accomplishments were remarkable.”

- Distribute and display the **Present and Delineate Argument: Independent Essay** handout. Review the directions. Remind students they completed a similar task with their collaborative essays in Lesson 5.

- Post the groupings, and direct students to find their group members and assignment for whom they’ll delineate arguments in the note-catchers. Direct them to begin, following the posted sequence for presenters and delineators in their group, using the Present and Delineate Argument: Independent Essay task.

- As students work, circulate to informally assess the students as noted in the assessment guidance note above. Aim to listen in to at least half of the students during this lesson, if possible. Remind students to be mindful of time and to keep the rotation moving as they present and listen. Reference the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart** as necessary, reminding students to show respect and compassion as they work with partners and evaluate their work.

Work Time

B. Share Peer Feedback – SL.6.4 (10 minutes)

- Direct students to share and discuss their feedback from listening to the presentations, including their steps and stars with their group members.

- Again, as students work, circulate to provide support or answer questions as needed. Reference the **Work to Contribute to a Better World anchor chart** as necessary, reminding students to give kind, specific, and helpful feedback that helps their peers to grow.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- Build more practice into Work Time B. As students listen to the stars and steps that their classmates offer them, challenge students who need lighter support to reiterate the feedback aloud back to their classmates, using their own words.

For Heavier Support

- Build more support into Work Time B. As students listen to the stars and steps that their classmates offer them, invite students who need heavier support to debrief their feedback comments with a trusted friend or home-language partner.

Closing and Assessment

A. Reflection Discussion – SL.6.1d (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can paraphrase and reflect on our multiple perspectives about our individual focus figures’ accomplishments.”

- Explain that students will debrief today’s learning with a Walk and Talk activity. Review the directions for this activity.

- Students move about the room safely and respectfully while music plays.

- On the teacher’s cue, students turn to the person closest to them and begin discussing the question.

- On the teacher’s cue, students finish their discussion and resume mingling about the classroom, waiting for the next cue and repeating the process until all questions are discussed.

- Discussion questions:

“What did you notice about the different arguments about the focus figures during today’s lesson?” (Responses will vary)

“What did you learn about these people and their experiences? What are some of the takeaways about these people after today’s lesson?” (Responses will vary)

“Why is it important that we know about these individuals?” (Responses will vary. Add pertinent answers to the Module Guiding Questions anchor chart under question 3: Why is it important to study the accomplishments of the ‘hidden figures’ and of others whose stories have gone unrecognized?)

- Use the **Grade 6 Speaking and Listening checklist (informal assessment)** to record students’ skills with paraphrasing and reflection (SL.6.1d).

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.
