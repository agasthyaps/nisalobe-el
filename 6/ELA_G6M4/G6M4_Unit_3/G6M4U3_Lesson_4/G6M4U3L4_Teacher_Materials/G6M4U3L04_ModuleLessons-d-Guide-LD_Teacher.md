Language Dive: Model Essay Conclusion  
Sentence Chunk Chart

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

The history of NACA and space science is incomplete **without acknowledgment of Dorothy Vaughan’s remarkable accomplishments.** (from conclusion paragraph of Model Argument Essay: “Dorothy”)

Launch

This Language Dive presents an example of an effective reflective statement from the conclusion of the model argument essay. It also invites students to examine a key feature of academic writing: the use of complex noun phrases separated by a simple verb (**is**). Students participated in a similar Language Dive in Module 3, Unit 3, Lesson 6; they analyzed a conclusion sentence from the model literary argument essay and noted there, too, the essay writer’s use of complex phrases and simple verbs. Invite students to revisit that Module 3 Language Dive before beginning this Language Dive. This will create an opportunity for students to activate background knowledge, reinforce past learning, and more efficiently build upon it during this Language Dive.

The history of NACA and space science is incomplete

Deconstruct

- Ask:

“What noun(s) do you see in this sentence? What verb(s) do you see? You can add these to your note-catcher, if you want.” (The nouns in this sentence are history, NACA, space, and science. The verb in this sentence is is.)  Step 2

“Where in the model argument essay about Dorothy can this chunk, and the rest of the sentence, be found?” (This chunk comes from the last sentence of the model essay.)

“How is Dorothy connected to the history of NACA and space science?” (Responses will vary, but may include: Dorothy was an important person at NACA. She contributed to projects at NACA that led to major advancements in space science.)

without acknowledgment of Dorothy Vaughan’s remarkable accomplishments.

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Ask:

“What nouns do you see in this chunk? What is similar about these nouns?” (The nouns in this chunk are acknowledgment and accomplishment. They both contain the affix  
-ment.)

- Note that students may point out that **Dorothy Vaughan** is also a noun. If productive, engage students in a discussion to remind them of the difference between common nouns (usually capitalized; refer to general people, places, and things) and proper nouns (capitalized; refer to specific things).

“Can you think of other nouns that contain the affix -ment?” (Responses will vary, but may include entertainment, encouragement, advertisement, embarrassment, and argument.)

“Using all of these nouns as examples, can you figure out the meaning and use of the affix -ment?” (The affix -ment is used to turn verbs into nouns. The noun describes the result of the verb, or action.)

- Point out that nouns formed from verbs, or “nominalizations,” are a common feature of academic writing.

“Why do you think nominalizations are common in academic writing?” (Responses will vary, but may include: nominalizations sound more objective than verbs; a lot of information can be packed into a single noun; nominalizations make writing more abstract and formal.)

- **Students can use Conversation Cues as they discuss. To provide heavier support, display a suggested sequence, such as the one below:**

- Let’s take time to think and write. (Goal 1)

- Can you say more about that? (Goal 1)

- Who can repeat what they said? (Goal 2)

- Who can add on to what they said? (Goal 4)

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Students can complete the sentence frame to discuss what is needed in their collaborative argument essays. They should use academic language, including nominalizations, to complete the frame.

> **My essay about Mary/Katherine is incomplete without \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**
>
> (My essay about Mary is incomplete without a detailed analysis of her most remarkable accomplishments).  Step 4

- To provide lighter support: Can you rearrange this sentence so that it begins with the word **without**?

- To provide heavier support: Provide students with examples of nominalizations that can be added to the frame (e.g., **recognition**, **description**, **analysis**).

The history of NACA and space science is incomplete without acknowledgment of Dorothy Vaughan’s remarkable accomplishments.

Reconstruct

- Ask:

“Besides the use of nominalizations, what about this sentence indicates that it is an example of academic writing?” (Responses will vary, but may include: this sentence is specific and clear; the sentence has a simple verb \[is\] and complex noun phrases; the sentence presents a strong position.)

“How does this sentence connect to the main claim in the model argument essay? How does this sentence move beyond the main claim?” (This sentence connects to the main claim because both this sentence and the claim say that Dorothy’s accomplishments were remarkable. This sentence moves beyond the main claim by saying why it is so important to recognize her remarkable accomplishments.)

“What is the purpose of this sentence in the overall essay? How does the position of the sentence at the end of the essay relate to its purpose?” (Responses will vary, but may include: The purpose of this sentence in the essay is to reflect on Dorothy’s accomplishments and say why it is important to remember them. This highlights the importance of the essay. By seeing this sentence at the end of the essay, readers are given something to think about and recognize why it matters that they just read about Dorothy’s accomplishments.)

“How can you include a similar sentence in the conclusions of your own argument essays?” (Responses will vary, but may include: in my argument essay about Mary/Katherine, I can point out the ways in which she has contributed to the advancement of space science and civil rights.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question: Why is it important to study the accomplishments of the ‘hidden figures’ and of others whose stories have gone unrecognized?” (Responses will vary.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice (Sentence)

- Students can complete the sentence frame with nominalizations that are complex and specific.

> **Mary Jackson’s/Katherine Johnson’s \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ deserve(s) \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**
>
> (Mary Jackson’s contributions to space science deserve celebration; Katherine Johnson’s talents deserve recognition.)  Step 5

- To provide lighter support: Invite students to write the sentence two ways: with nominalizations, and without (e.g., **Mary Jackson contributed to space science and that deserves to be celebrated**). Then, they can discuss which is more effective and why.

- To provide heavier support: provide students with verbs that can be turned into nouns and then added to the sentence frame (e.g., **accomplish**, **celebrate**, **recognize**, **contribute**, **achieve**).
