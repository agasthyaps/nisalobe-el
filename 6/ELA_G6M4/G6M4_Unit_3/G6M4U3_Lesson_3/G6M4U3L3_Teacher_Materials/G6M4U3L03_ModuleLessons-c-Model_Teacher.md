Mary Jackson was a woman of many talents. She was only twenty-six when she became one of NACA’s West Computers (76). Like her boss Dorothy Vaughan, Mary was a tremendous mathematician who was not intimidated by professional challenges. She helped the US government reach its goals in space science. In the face of harsh racial and gender discrimination—including racist acts by her own coworkers—Mary persevered and accomplished remarkable things. Mary’s accomplishments are particularly remarkable because of their impact in the field of space science and in the lives of other young black women in engineering.

Mary’s accomplishments made lasting contributions in space science. At the time of the Space Race, the United States was competing to build a military airplane that could fly faster than sound. The executive secretary of NACA said that this would help the United States maintain its “supremacy in the air” (81). Mary was one of the mathematicians working on this project with the Supersonic Pressure Tunnel (91). She had been given the assignment by one of the most respected managers at the laboratory (91). He trusted her with some of the most detailed work in the project. Mary produced very complicated calculations without errors (91). These “rocket planes” were the first step toward building aircraft that could fly high enough and fast enough to reach outer space (112). This helped the United States reach its incredible goals in space science.

Another reason why Mary’s accomplishments are remarkable is because they inspired other black women to pursue their engineering dreams. Mary always enjoyed her role as a mentor and leader for young women. She wanted women in her community to excel. To her, “life was a long process of raising one’s expectations” (79). In 1962, Mary gave a lecture with a white colleague called, “The Aspects of Engineering for Women” (159). The lecture took place at an all-black high school in Virginia, one of the worst places for segregation. Mary was a black woman, presenting alongside a white woman, about a future in engineering. As such, Mary was a part of breaking down barriers for black women. Mary’s accomplishments are remarkable because they helped to “make room for the women coming behind her” (159).

W.6.1b: Claims are supported with clear reasons and relevant evidence from the text.

W.6.1c, L.6.6: Words, phrases, and clauses are consistently used to clarify the relationships among claim(s) and reasons.

W.6.1e: Concluding statement follows from the argument presented.

RI.6.1, W.6.9b: Valid claim supported by logical reasons and evidence from the text demonstrates a clear understanding of the text.

L.6.2: Adequate use of the conventions of standard English capitalization, punctuation, and spelling is evident.

At a time of rampant discrimination against black women, Mary excelled. With less help and more obstacles than other people might have had, Mary accomplished remarkable things. These accomplishments are remarkable because of their impact. Her accomplishments led to big changes in space science and served as an important example for other young people who looked up to her. It is important that this Hidden Figure is hidden no longer. Her accomplishments deserve celebration.

Katherine Johnson was an exceptional mathematician. Even as a child, Katherine demonstrated special talents in math (94). These talents led Katherine to graduate school at West Virginia University. She was one of the very first black students to attend that school, which had been segregated for a long time (96). Her mathematical abilities, combined with her courage and perseverance, led Katherine to accomplish remarkable things. Her accomplishments are especially remarkable because they required tremendous courage and because they led to major advancements in the world of flight.

Katherine was a very courageous person. She was one of three black students, and the only female among them, to desegregate West Virginia University (96). She and the other two students had been specifically chosen to attend the university because they were “unusually capable” students (96). This accomplishment required incredible bravery. Desegregating the university could have been very dangerous. Katherine’s former principal gave her a set of math books in case the library wouldn’t let her use theirs (96). Katherine’s mother even moved with her to help in case Katherine was bullied. Katherine showed courage again once she was at Langley. At the laboratory, she fought for the right to attend important meetings of the Flight Research Division (142–143). These meetings had only been open to white men before Katherine spoke up. As these remarkable accomplishments show, Katherine’s courageous decisions helped pave the way for other black women.

Another reason why Katherine’s accomplishments were remarkable is because they led to big changes in flight research. One of Katherine’s assignments was to figure out why a certain plane had crashed (104). Her research led to major changes in air traffic regulations (105). As a result, there are now clear rules about how close together two planes can fly. Traveling by plane is common practice now and would be much more dangerous without this knowledge. Without Katherine’s mathematical talents, air travel would not be the same.

W.6.1e: Concluding statement follows from the argument presented.

RI.6.1, W.6.9b: Valid claim supported by logical reasons and evidence from the text demonstrates a clear understanding of the text.

L.6.2: Adequate use of the conventions of standard English capitalization, punctuation, and spelling is evident.

At a time of rampant discrimination against black women, Katherine excelled. With less help and more obstacles than other people might have had, Katherine accomplished remarkable things. These accomplishments are remarkable because they show incredibly bravery and intelligence. Her accomplishments paved the way for other young women and led to big changes in space science. It is important that this Hidden Figure is hidden no longer. Her accomplishments deserve celebration.
