Part I

**Directions:** As you read about Mary Jackson, keep track of her distinct accomplishments by adding each to the first column. Explain why this particular accomplishment is remarkable in the second column. Gather and cite specific evidence from the text as appropriate for both columns. You will be revising and adding to this note-catcher throughout Unit 2 to help you eventually be able to make a claim in response to the focus question.

**Focus Question:** Why are Mary Jackson’s accomplishments remarkable?

<p><strong>• Jackson was given an assignment by one of the lab’s top-ranking and most respected managers. Her work for him was flawless (91).</strong></p></td>
<td><p><strong>She supported America in the race to be the first to build an airplane that could fly faster than sound. This would help with the war effort.</strong></p>

<p><strong>• The US government wanted to use her research for military applications (116).</strong></p></td>

<td><p><strong>It took place in Virginia, considered the worst state for segregation. It also invited girls into the engineering field where few opportunities for women were available.</strong></p>
<p><strong>They demonstrated the importance of hard work, talent, and drive to overcome racial and gender discrimination. Jackson wanted to be part of breaking down barriers for other African American girls.</strong></p></td>

1.  Review your notes in the second column. What are two possible points/reasons you could use to support a claim about why Mary Jackson’s accomplishments are remarkable? Remember, you might have to look across the explanations in the second column for trends or ways to generalize from the specifics to find the wording for your reasons.

Responses will vary, but may include: impacted science and impacted other black woman engineers.

2.  Draft a possible claim statement by incorporating your two points/reasons:

Responses will vary, but may include: Mary Jackson’s accomplishments are remarkable because of their impact in the field of space science and in the lives of other young black women in engineering.

Part II

**Directions:** As you read about Katherine Johnson, keep track of her distinct accomplishments by adding each to the first column. Explain why this particular accomplishment is remarkable in the second column. Gather and cite specific evidence from the text as appropriate for both columns. You will be revising and adding to this note-catcher throughout Unit 2 to help you eventually be able to make a claim in response to the focus question.

<td><p><strong>Katherine Johnson was one of the first students to desegregate a graduate school in West Virginia.</strong></p>
<p><strong>• The Supreme Court ordered that if separate graduate schools for blacks weren’t created, then white schools had to be integrated. The president of Johnson’s former college chose Katherine as one of only three students to desegregate West Virginia University (96).</strong></p>
<p><strong>• Desegregating the school was potentially dangerous. Katherine’s mother moved with her to help in case Katherine was bullied. Also, Katherine’s former principal gave her a set of math books in case the library wouldn’t let her use theirs (96).</strong></p></td>
<td><strong>There were no graduate programs for black students at the time. Johnson had to be brave and pioneer this path for other black students.</strong></td>

<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>Her research led to changes in air traffic regulations that made air travel safer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>• After a plane fell out of the sky for no reason, Katherine’s analysis of the plane’s instruments revealed that air disturbance by a jet that flew past a half hour earlier caused the crash (104).</strong></p>
<p><strong>• Katherine’s research showed that planes have to keep a minimum distance from one another (105).</strong></p></td>
<td><p><strong>At the time, this was a revelation. Airplane passengers today are much safer as a result.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Traveling by plane is common practice now and would be much more dangerous without this knowledge.</strong></p></td>

<td><p><strong>She was finally allowed to attend the meetings and lectures of the Aerospace Mechanics Division of NASA.</strong></p>
<p><strong>• Women were routinely overlooked. Men were the head of divisions and controlled women’s salaries, promotions, and tasks (142).</strong></p>
<p><strong>• “The problem was that women had to get over the high hurdle of low expectations—they needed to prove that they were just as good as men and should be held to the same standards and given the same opportunities” (143).</strong></p></td>
<td><p><strong>Women were generally not allowed at these meetings. Going to the meetings meant she had access to the latest information about aeronautics.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Johnson was helping to make the materials for these lectures. The lectures were essentially the first textbook about outer space. Johnson fought for the opportunity to be part of the meetings where important information was being shared.</strong></p></td>

Remember, you might have to look across the explanations in the second column for trends or ways to generalize from the specifics to find the wording for your reasons.

Responses will vary, but may include: tremendous courage and important to flight technology.

4.  Draft a possible claim statement by incorporating your two points/reasons:

Responses will vary, but may include: Katherine Johnson’s accomplishments are remarkable because they required tremendous courage and because they led to major advancements in the world of flight.
