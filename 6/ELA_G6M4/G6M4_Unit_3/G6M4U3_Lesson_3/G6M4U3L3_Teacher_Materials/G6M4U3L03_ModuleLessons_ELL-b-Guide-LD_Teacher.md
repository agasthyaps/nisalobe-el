5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

RI.6.1, W.6.1a, W.6.1d, SL.6.1

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

Dorothy’s skills and hard work were very important **in helping change the face of air travel.** (from Proof Paragraph 1 of the Model Argument Essay: “Dorothy”)

**Lesson 1 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after students analyze Proof Paragraph 1 of the model argument essay in Work Time A.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students respond to the daily learning target (**I can introduce a claim and support that claim with clear reasons and relevant evidence drawn from informational texts**) and address W.6.1a by restating the first reason why Dorothy Vaughan’s accomplishments were remarkable. The sentence also helps students address W.6.1d by containing a prepositional phrase that gives additional information in a formal way. Supporting standards: RI.6.1, SL.6.1.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it includes a prepositional phrase (**in helping change the face of air travel**), which helps clarify why Dorothy’s skills and hard work are important.

- Transfer: Students can use the Practice frame in the Proof Paragraphs of their collaborative and independent essays about the hidden figures.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **Dorothy’s skills and hard work were very important  
  <u>in helping change the face of air travel.</u>**

- Ask:

“What is this sentence about?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **in helping change the face of air travel.**

- Ask:

“What do you notice about the structure of this chunk?” (Responses will vary, but may include: this chunk begins with a preposition; this chunk has a gerund.)

“What does this chunk tell us about Dorothy’s skills and hard work?” (Responses will vary, but may include: This chunk tells us more about why her skills and hard work were important. It points out what they were important for.)

- If productive, point out that prepositional phrases, like the one in this chunk, can be useful for providing this kind of additional information.

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **Dorothy’s skills and hard work were very important <u>in helping change the face of air travel.</u>**

- Ask:

“Why do you think the writer starts the Proof Paragraph 1 with this sentence?” (This sentence introduces the first reason, which is then supported with evidence and reasoning throughout the Proof Paragraph.)

“How does this sentence relate to the main claim presented in the introduction paragraph?” (The main claim included the reason that Dorothy’s accomplishments are remarkable because they led to major advancements in air travel. This sentence restates that main reason.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target:  
I can introduce a claim and support that claim with clear reasons and relevant evidence drawn from informational text?” (Responses will vary.)

“How can you use a sentence with a similar structure in your own argument essays?” (Responses will vary, but may include: I can use a sentence with a similar structure to explain why Katherine Johnson’s or Mary Jackson’s skills and qualities were important.)

Practice

**-ing** phrase
