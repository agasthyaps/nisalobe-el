**Focus Question: Why are <u>Mary Jackson’s</u> accomplishments remarkable?**

**Introduction**

How will you catch the reader’s attention? (Consider using facts, statistics, quotations, or anecdotes.)

Emphasize how young Jackson was when she joined NASA.

Explain her connection to Dorothy Vaughan.

What context about the text or topic does your reader need in order to make sense of the rest of your essay?

Explain the historical time period (post-World War II during the Space Race).

Explain the social context (rampant discrimination against African Americans and limited opportunities for women).

Write your main claim. Include the name of your assigned hidden figure and the two specific points you are using to support the main claim.

Mary’s accomplishments are particularly remarkable because of their impact in the field of space science and in the lives of other young black women in engineering.

**Proof Paragraph 1 for Point 1**

What is the first point that supports your claim?

Mary’s accomplishments made lasting contributions in space science.

**Evidence**

What evidence from the text(s) supports this point?

Worked on a project with the Supersonic Pressure Tunnel to build airplanes that could fly faster than sound (91).

Given the assignment by one of the most respected managers at the laboratory (91); he trusted her with some of the most detailed work in the project.

Mary produced very complicated calculations without errors (91).

**Reasoning**

How does this evidence support this point?

These “rocket planes” were the first step toward building aircraft that could fly high enough and fast enough to reach outer space (112).

Helped the United States reach its incredible goals in space science.

**Proof Paragraph 2 for Point 2**

What is the second point that supports your claim?

Inspired other black women to pursue their engineering dreams.

**Evidence**

What evidence from the text(s) supports this point?

In 1962, Mary gave a lecture with a white colleague called, “The Aspects of Engineering for Women” (159).

Lecture took place at an all-black high school in Virginia, one of the worst places for segregation. Presented alongside a white woman about girls’ future in engineering.

**Reasoning**

How does this evidence support this point?

Helped break down barriers for black women.

Helped to “make room for the women coming behind her” (159).

Conclusion

Restate your claim from the introduction.

Mary’s accomplishments are remarkable because of their impact. Her accomplishments led to big changes in space science and served as an important example for other young people who looked up to her.

What are your further reflections on this topic?

- Why does this argument/claim matter?

- What would happen if this claim were not acted upon?

- Who is likely to benefit from this?

It is important that this hidden figure is hidden no longer. Her accomplishments deserve celebration.

**Focus Question: Why are <u>Katherine Johnson’s</u> accomplishments remarkable?**

**Introduction**

How will you catch the reader’s attention? (Consider using facts, statistics, quotations, or anecdotes.)

Emphasize Katherine’s extraordinary talent for math.

What context about the text or topic does your reader need in order to make sense of the rest of your essay?

Explain the historical time period (post-World War II during the Space Race).

Explain the social context (rampant discrimination against African Americans and limited opportunities for women).

Write your main claim. Include the name of your assigned hidden figure and the two specific points you are using to support the main claim.

Katherine’s accomplishments are especially remarkable because they required tremendous courage and because they led to major advancements in the world of flight.

Proof Paragraph 1 for Point 1

What is the first point that supports your claim?

Katherine was very courageous in the face of discrimination.

**Evidence**

What evidence from the text(s) supports this point?

Katherine was one of three black students, and the only female among them, to desegregate West Virginia University (96).

She and the other two students had been specifically chosen to attend the university because they were “unusually capable” students (96).

Former principal gave her a set of math books in case the library wouldn’t let her use theirs (96).

Mother moved with her to help in case Katherine was bullied.

At Langley, she fought for the right to attend important meetings of the Flight Research Division (142–143).

**Reasoning**

How does this evidence support this point?

Katherine’s fight against segregation could have been dangerous for her but helped pave the path for other black women.

Proof Paragraph 2 for Point 2

What is the second point that supports your claim?

Katherine Johnson’s research led to big changes in flight research.

**Evidence**

What evidence from the text(s) supports this point?

One assignment was to figure out why a certain plane had crashed (104).

Research led to major changes in air traffic regulations (105). Now there are clear rules about how close together two planes can fly.

**Reasoning**

How does this evidence support this point?

Traveling by plane is common practice now and would be much more dangerous without this knowledge.

Without Katherine’s mathematical talents, air travel would not be the same.

Conclusion

Restate your claim from the introduction.

Katherine’s accomplishments are remarkable because they show incredible bravery and intelligence. Her accomplishments paved the way for other young women and led to big changes in space science.

What are your further reflections on this topic?

- Why does this argument/claim matter?

- What would happen if this claim were not acted upon?

- Who is likely to benefit from this?

It is important that this hidden figure is hidden no longer. Her accomplishments deserve celebration.
