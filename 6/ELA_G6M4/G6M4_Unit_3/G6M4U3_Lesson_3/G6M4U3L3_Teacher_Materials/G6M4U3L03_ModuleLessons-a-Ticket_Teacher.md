**Directions:** As you enter class, read the learning targets. Next, read the sample student introductions below. Using the Argument Writing checklist, write kind, specific, helpful feedback to help the authors improve their introductions.

> It’s totally not fair that history often overlooks Dorothy Vaughan. She, along with the other awesome women of the segregated West Area Computing Unit, worked on projects that made airplanes faster and more stable. This helped the United States during World War II!!! Victory!!! Then she was promoted to supervisor of the West Computers. She led the women whose work would make space travel possible, and, as you know, women never get the recognition they deserve. As one of the first black women to work for NASA as a “computer” (not the kind of computer you’re thinking of, tho), Dorothy’s accomplishments deserve to be remembered. Her accomplishments were remarkable because they led to major advancements in air travel and because they took place despite tremendous obstacles. I want to be just like Dorothy Vaughan!

Responses will vary, but may include: The introduction includes relevant information but does not use formal language. Remove personal pronouns that refer to the author or the reader directly. Take out extra exclamation points and other language that is more conversational, such as “Victory!!!” Remember to also spell all words correctly (e.g., “tho”) to give the writing a more academic tone.

> When recalling America’s race to put an astronaut on the moon, history often overlooks Dorothy Vaughan. She, along with the other women, worked on projects that made them faster and more stable, which helped the United States win the war. Then she was promoted to supervisor of the West Computers. She led those whose work would make space travel possible. As a brilliant mathematician and one of the first black women to work for NASA as a “computer,” her accomplishments deserve to be remembered. Her accomplishments were remarkable because they led to major advancements and because they took place despite obstacles.

Responses will vary, but may include: The spelling and punctuation of the introduction are correct, but the writing is often vague. Use specific nouns to clarify any vague pronouns (e.g., swapping “Dorothy Vaughan” for “she.” Clarify other places where the writing is vague by including specific evidence, such as listing the actual “advancements” that Vaughan’s work led to or naming the “other women” with whom Vaughan worked.
