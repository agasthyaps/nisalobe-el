> It’s totally not fair that history often overlooks Dorothy Vaughan. She, along with the other awesome women of the segregated West Area Computing Unit, worked on projects that made airplanes faster and more stable. This helped the United States during World War II!!! Victory!!! Then she was promoted to supervisor of the West Computers. She led the women whose work would make space travel possible, and, as you know, women never get the recognition they deserve. As one of the first black women to work for NASA as a “computer” (not the kind of computer you’re thinking of, tho), Dorothy’s accomplishments deserve to be remembered. Her accomplishments were remarkable because they led to major advancements in air travel and because they took place despite tremendous obstacles. I want to be just like Dorothy Vaughan!
