Note-Catcher

RI.6.1, RI.6.3, W.6.1, W.6.9b, W.6.10

(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you read about Dorothy Vaughan, keep track of her distinct accomplishments by adding each to the first column. Explain why this particular accomplishment is remarkable in the second column. Gather and cite specific evidence from the text as appropriate for both columns. You will be revising and adding to this note-catcher throughout Unit 3 to help you eventually be able to make a claim in response to the focus question.

1.  Review your notes in the second column. What are two possible reasons/points you could use to support a claim about why Dorothy Vaughan’s accomplishments are remarkable? Remember, you might have to look across the explanations in the second column for trends or ways to generalize from the specifics to find the wording for your reasons.

Responses will vary, but may include: major advancements in air travel; overcame major obstacles to success.

2.  Draft a possible claim statement by incorporating your two reasons/points:

Responses will vary, but may include: Dorothy Vaughan’s accomplishments are remarkable because they led to major advancements in air travel and because they took place despite tremendous obstacles.
