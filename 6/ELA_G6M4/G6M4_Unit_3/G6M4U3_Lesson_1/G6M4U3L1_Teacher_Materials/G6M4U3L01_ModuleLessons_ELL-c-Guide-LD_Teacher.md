5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

RI.6.1, W.6.1a, W.6.1c, SL.6.1

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

Her accomplishments were remarkable **because they led to major advancements in air travel and because they took place despite tremendous obstacles.** (from the introduction of the Model Argument Essay: “Dorothy”)

**Lesson 1 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after students analyze the model argument essay in Work Time A.

**Rationale**

- Guiding Question and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students respond to the guiding question (**What were the accomplishments of the “hidden figures” at NACA, and why were they remarkable?**) and address W.6.1a by presenting two reasons to support the claim that Dorothy Vaughan’s accomplishments were remarkable. This sentence also helps students address W.6.1c by featuring conjunctions (**because**) to clarify the relationship between the model essay’s main claim and its reasons. Supporting standards: RI.6.1, SL.6.1.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it features multiple clauses and because it uses conjunctions and prepositions (**despite**).

- Transfer: Students can use the Practice frame to develop the focus statements for their collaborative essays about the hidden figures and for their independent essays about their focus figures.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **Her accomplishments were remarkable <u>because they led to major advancements in air travel and because they took place despite tremendous obstacles.</u>**

- Ask:

“What is this sentence about?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **because they led to major advancements in air travel and because they took place despite tremendous obstacles.**

- Ask:

“What do you notice about this chunk?” (Responses will vary, but may include: this chunk presents two reasons to support the main claims; the word because is used twice; there are two dependent clauses separated by and.)

- Underline the two uses of the word **because** in the sentence, and invite students to do the same on their note-catchers.

“What does the word because tell us about what comes next?” (The word because tells us that what comes next is a reason or an explanation.)

“Can you figure out why the word because would likely be found in an argument essay like this one?” (Argument essays feature a main claim, and claims require reasons to prove that the claims are true. The word because signals that a reason is going to be given, so it follows that because would be used to introduce reasons in an argument essay.)

“What do you notice about the structures that follow the word because in this sentence?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to notice that complete sentences, or independent clauses, follow each use of the word because. As needed, remind students that independent clauses can stand alone and contain a subject \[e.g., they\] and a verb \[e.g., led to; took place\].)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **Her accomplishments were remarkable <u>because they led to major advancements in air travel and because they took place despite tremendous obstacles.</u>**

- Ask:

“What adjectives do you see in this sentence? Underline them on your note-catcher.” (remarkable, major, tremendous)

“How do these adjectives add to the idea that Dorothy’s accomplishments were remarkable?” (These adjectives show how big and important Dorothy’s work was. Her accomplishments were remarkable because they were challenging and had an impact. These adjectives make it clear that Dorothy’s work was important and remarkable.)

“How can you use meaningful adjectives in your own focus statements to highlight how remarkable Mary or Katherine’s accomplishments were?” (Responses will vary.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question:

What were the accomplishments of the ‘hidden figures’ at NACA, and why were they remarkable?” (Responses will vary, but may include: This sentence includes specific reasons that explain why the accomplishments were remarkable. In Dorothy’s case, her accomplishments were remarkable because of their impact on airplanes and because of their context.)

“How can you use a similar structure in your own argument essays?” (Responses will vary, but may include that in our own argument essays, we can use the word because to introduce the two reasons that we will use to support our main claims.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_’s accomplishments were remarkable because \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

hidden figure’s name independent clause

**and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

independent clause

- Say:

“Use this frame to talk about the remarkable accomplishments of either Mary Jackson or Katherine Johnson. Use your own words and work with your collaborative writing partners.”

- Responses will vary, but may include:

> **<u>Katherine</u>’s accomplishments are remarkable because <u>they required profound courage</u> and <u>because they led to huge advancements in the world of flight</u>**.
