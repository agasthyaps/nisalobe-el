**Part II**

**Remarkable Accomplishments**

**Directions:** As you read about your focus figure from your research sources, keep track of their distinct accomplishments by adding each to the first column. Explain why this particular accomplishment is remarkable in the second column. Gather and cite specific evidence from the text as appropriate for both columns. You will be revising and adding to this note-catcher in Units 2 and 3 to help you eventually be able to make a claim in response to the focus question. (RI.6.1, RI.6.7, W.6.8, SL.6.2)

<td><p><strong>broke widely accepted gender stereotypes</strong></p>
<p><strong>born into a family that valued education even though women at the time were not educated; father and grandfather taught her astronomy and math (Ignotofsky)</strong></p>
<p><strong>By age sixteen, she was independently studying advanced math and astronomy, for example, reading Euclid’s <em>Elements</em> (<a href="http://massivesci.com/">massivesci.com</a>).</strong></p>
<p><strong>acted as a tutor for male students—unheard of for a woman! (<a href="http://massivesci.com/">massivesci.com</a>)</strong></p>
<p><strong>learned poetry from her grandmother, published books of her original poetry (<a href="http://massivesci.com/">massivesci.com</a>)</strong></p>
<p><strong>She wrote twelve books, most on math topics such as the Pythagorean Theorem, trigonometry, and the movement of the moon (<a href="http://massivesci.com/">massivesci.com</a>).</strong></p></td>
<td><p><strong>Born in China in 1768 during the Qing dynasty; women’s rights were limited, especially in terms of education.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Because her family supported her education, Zhenyi became a famous mathematician, astronomer, and poet. She proved that women were just as deserving of an education and could be as successful academically as men.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This is especially remarkable because it happened in the eighteenth century, hundreds of years before modern-day women’s rights movements.</strong></p>
<p><strong>She also died at age twenty-nine, so she contributed a lot to academics in a relatively short lifespan.</strong></p></td>

<td><p><strong>learned to calculate equinoxes and eclipses</strong></p>
<p><strong>created a model to understand eclipses using a lamp as the sun, a mirror as the moon, and a table for the earth; she proved that lunar eclipses are a natural occurrence, not a supernatural one, as previously believed (Ignotofsky)</strong></p>
<p><strong>measured the stars and studied the Chinese calendar to understand the movement of the solar system (Ignotofsky)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Her goal was to make science easier for others to understand. For example, she rewrote <em>Principles of Calculation</em> by Mei Wending and <em>The Simple Principles of Calculation</em> so they would be easier for beginner mathematicians to read (<a href="http://massivesci.com/">massivesci.com</a>).</strong></p>
<p><strong>believed in replacing the lunar calendar used in China with the Western solar calendar (<a href="http://massivesci.com/">massivesci.com</a>)</strong></p></td>
<td><p><strong>This is remarkable because she was one of the first to understand the movement of the Earth, the moon, and the sun, and she did this with only eighteenth-century technology.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Little was known about the movement of stars and planetary bodies at the time.</strong></p>
<p><strong>found ways to teach this to others in ways they could easily understand</strong></p>
<p><strong>It also remarkable that she wanted to share education with others; her contributions to math and science allowed other people to have access to information they may not have understood previously.</strong></p></td>

1.  Review your notes in the second column. What are two possible reasons/points you could use to support a claim about why your focus figure’s accomplishments are remarkable? Remember, you might have to look across the explanations for trends or ways to generalize from the specifics to find the wording for your reasons.

broke gender stereotypes and traditional roles; significant discovery about space science

2.  Draft a possible claim statement by incorporating your two reasons/points:

Wang Zhenyi’s accomplishments are remarkable because she was able to break out of traditional gender roles and because she was the first to understand the movement of Earth, which allowed much of later space research to occur.
