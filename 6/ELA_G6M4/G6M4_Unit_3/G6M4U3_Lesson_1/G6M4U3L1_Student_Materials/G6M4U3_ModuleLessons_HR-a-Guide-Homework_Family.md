Why is it important to study the accomplishments of the “hidden figures” and of others whose stories have gone unrecognized?

- *Hidden figures are often “hidden” due to discrimination in the way history is written.*

- *Our study of history is most accurate when we celebrate the contributions of all involved.*

- *The accomplishments of hidden figures are remarkable, especially because they are achieved in the face of adversity.*

What will your student be doing at school?

As the anchor text is concluded, students are prepared with overwhelming text evidence that the accomplishments of each of the “hidden figures” are truly remarkable. They craft their evidence and reasoning into an argument essay, collaborating with their peers as they practice their writing skills to answer the following prompt: why are the hidden figures’ accomplishments remarkable? To continue their work of revealing the contributions of those who have not received the credit they deserve, students will also conduct research on another hidden figure in space science from a given list of options. They practice the research skills they learned earlier in the school year to gather relevant and accurate information about why this person’s accomplishments are also remarkable. They synthesize their research, writing, and argument skills in an argument essay about their focus figure, written independently for the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment.

Finally, working in a “crew” of three, students take the roles of authors, illustrators, and editors to create a picture book version of their focus figure, just as the author of *Hidden Figures* did when she adapted her story into a young readers edition as well as a picture book edition for primary school learners. This task is designed to bring the stories of these previously overlooked figures into the mainstream and share them with a younger audience. Each crew will present their stories, using effective presentation techniques such as appropriate eye contact, volume, and pacing. This unit serves to help students answer one of the module’s guiding questions: **Why is it important to study the accomplishments of the “hidden figures” and of others whose stories have gone unrecognized?** This question, though rooted in evidence from the texts studied in this module, allows students a foundation from which they can continue the conversation about the ways that discrimination continues to shroud the accomplishments of marginalized populations.

Central to the EL Education curriculum is a focus on “habits of character” and social-emotional learning. Students work to become effective learners, developing mindsets and skills for success in college, career, and life (e.g., initiative, responsibility, perseverance, collaboration); work to become ethical people, treating others well and standing up for what is right (e.g., empathy, integrity, respect, compassion); and work to contribute to a better world, putting their learning to use to improve communities (e.g., citizenship, service).

Students work to become effective learners by exhibiting initiative, responsibility, and collaboration throughout the collaborative essay writing process and the picture book creation process. Students will be guided to give kind, helpful, and specific feedback when working with their peers and pushing each other toward a high-quality final product. Students work to become ethical people through the respect and integrity they show during their research process on their focus figure. Students are given voice and choice in choosing their focus figure; an interest in this person’s work should foster a level of respect and integrity that motivates the students’ research. The students will be contributing to a better world by educating others about the remarkable accomplishments of women who have themselves contributed to a better world through their work in space science.

How can you support your student at home?

Encourage your child to write every day, whether in a journal or for daily tasks, like making a grocery list. Provide opportunities for daily reading as well with frequent trips to the library and a time in the schedule to enjoy reading. Model these literacy practices by indulging in a good book or magazine yourself.

Read and discuss nonfiction articles about current events. Talk to your child about the point of view being presented by the author, how the point of view is conveyed, and what other perspectives on the topic someone else might have.

Ask your students about the focus figure they are researching for their picture book. Help your student compose the text by orally processing what they might write and the best way to make the story interesting for a younger audience. Ask to see the final pages upon completion of the story!

Act as the audience while your student rehearses the presentation of their book and the argument for why their focus figure’s accomplishments are remarkable. Students are taught to use the language “stars” and “steps” for offering kind, helpful, and specific feedback. Offer your student stars and steps on their presentation and/or their picture book.

Discuss the module guiding questions with your student, especially the focus of this unit: why is it important to study the accomplishments of the “hidden figures” and of others whose stories have gone unrecognized?

Unit 3: Homework

In Unit 3, students continue research on their focus figure, complete assigned portions related to their collaborative argument essay, and complete assigned portions related to their children’s book pages.

**Research reading:** Your student is expected to independently research the topic of study in this module, Remarkable Accomplishments in Space Science, by reading topic-related books of his or her choice. Research reading will be assigned on evenings when students are not already reading the anchor text. Students will be expected to read for approximately 20 minutes each day and respond to a prompt of choice in the front of the independent reading journal.

**Choice reading:** If your student would also like to independently read and respond to a book of free choice, he or she may use the back of the independent reading journal.

Independent Reading

**Directions:** Remember to record responses to research reading in the front of your independent reading journal and responses to choice reading in the back. Try to choose a different prompt each time.

Record any new vocabulary in your vocabulary log. Underline vocabulary found during independent reading.

**Record:**

- Date

- Title and author of your reading book

- Pages you have read

- Prompt

- Response

**Example:**

<u>Date</u>: 05/20/2019

<u>Book Title and Author</u>: *Hidden Figures* (Young Readers’ Edition) by Margot Lee Shetterly

<u>Pages Read</u>: 153–158

<u>Prompt</u>: Which habits of character are demonstrated in the text? Explain.

<u>Response</u>: Mary Jackson used her strengths to help her son build a car for the soap box derby. Being an engineer and having extensive knowledge of aerodynamics, Mary was able to use her expertise to guide her son. Mary and Levi worked tirelessly to figure out the best design for the soap box car. Mary and Levi used the habit of collaboration to build the best car. They made sketches, took measurements, tested different designs, and searched their garage for materials to use to build the car.

**Consider using the following independent reading prompts.**[^1]

- How does this text add to your understanding of one of the guiding questions of the module?

- Which habits of character are demonstrated in the text? Explain.

- Which habits of character are NOT demonstrated in the text? Explain.

- Record two or three facts in your own words that you learned from the text.

- Summarize your research reading today in no more than five sentences.

- Explain a way in which you connect to the text.

- Explain how the text connects to another text you’ve read.

- Explain how the text connects to something currently happening in the world.

- Explain how the text connects to *Hidden Figures* (Young Readers’ Edition).

- Explain how the text relates to the topic of Remarkable Accomplishments in Space Science.

- Explain how excerpts from the text represent accurate historical context.

- Choose one new word from your reading today, and analyze it on a vocabulary square.

| **Definition in your own words**                  | **Synonyms** (words with the same meaning) |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Words with the same affix or root**             | **Sketch**                                 |
| **Translation in home language** (if appropriate) |                                            |

Vocabulary

**Directions:** In the classroom, you have been recording words from your texts in your vocabulary log. Throughout this unit, you have been research reading topic-related books at home to build your knowledge of the Space Race and recording words in your independent reading journal.

Choose a word from your research reading or from a text you’ve read in class and add the word to your vocabulary log. Try to choose a different word to add and to practice a different vocabulary strategy each time. For each word, be sure to add the following:

1.  The definition, or meaning, of the word

<!-- -->

2.  The vocabulary strategy you used to figure out the meaning of the word

3.  A sketch or diagram that helps you to better understand the meaning of the word

Record new vocabulary in vocabulary logs and mark academic vocabulary with a symbol, for example a star:

- Academic vocabulary: words you might find in informational texts on many different topics. For example, the words **evidence** and **rationale** are words that could be found in books on any topic.

- Domain-specific vocabulary: words about a particular topic. For example, the words **rocket**, **velocity**, and **orbit** are some that would be found on the topic of space science.

Vocabulary Strategies

As a reminder, the vocabulary strategies we’ve been working on in class are listed below:

- Context: read the sentence around the word.

- Look at the affixes for clues.

- Look at the root of the word for clues.

- Use a dictionary.

- Discuss the word with another person (after attempting some of the above strategies).

[^1]: Some of the prompts will not be appropriate for the text students are reading. Invite students to choose a prompt that works for the text they have just read.
