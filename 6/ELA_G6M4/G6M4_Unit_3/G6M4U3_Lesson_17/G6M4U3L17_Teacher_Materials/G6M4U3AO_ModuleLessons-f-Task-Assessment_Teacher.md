End of Unit 3 Assessment Part II: Collaborative Discussion

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** This assessment has two parts. In Part I, you will complete a QuickWrite to help you prepare for the discussion. In Part II, you will participate in a collaborative discussion. (W.6.10, SL.6.1)

**Part I**

**QuickWrite**

To prepare for this discussion, QuickWrite in response to the following questions (these were our module guiding questions):

- What were the main events of the Space Race, and in what scientific, political, and social context did it take place?

- What were the accomplishments of the “hidden figures” at NACA, and why were they remarkable?

- Why is it important to study the accomplishments of the “hidden figures” and of others whose stories have gone unrecognized?

Remember to use details and examples from the unit texts and/or your own research to support and explain your thinking.

What were the main events of the Space Race, and in what scientific, political, and social context did it take place?

> • The Space Race was an international competition of space exploration that began with the Soviet Union launching the Sputnik satellite and culminated with the United States sending the first human being to the moon in 1969 during the Apollo 11 mission.
>
> • Scientifically, sending a human being to the moon seemed an impossible undertaking that required deep understanding of many scientific phenomena  
> (e.g., wind tunnels, supersonic flight, trajectories, advanced aircraft).
>
> • Politically, the United States and the Soviet Union were at odds, and the Space Race became a symbol of innovation and power.
>
> • Socially, the Space Race took place at a time of rampant discrimination against black Americans in the United States. At that time, women of all races were also generally excluded from well-paying jobs in math and science.

What were the accomplishments of the “hidden figures” at NACA, and why were they remarkable?

> • The West End Computers at NACA, or the “hidden figures,” impacted scientific progress by using their exceptional talents in math and science to advance key projects in space science.
>
> • The “hidden figures” impacted social progress by serving as the first black women to take on positions at NACA, including leadership positions.
>
> • The “hidden figures” used their personal strength and professional talents to help themselves, their families, their communities, NACA, and the United States, thus contributing to a better world.

Why is it important to study the accomplishments of the “hidden figures” and of others whose stories have gone unrecognized?

> • Hidden figures are often “hidden” due to discrimination in the way history is written.
>
> • Our study of history is most accurate when we celebrate the contributions of all involved.
>
> • The accomplishments of hidden figures are remarkable, especially because they are achieved in the face of adversity.

**Part II**

**Collaborative Discussion**

You will participate in a collaborative discussion to discuss the above guiding questions and some additional reflection questions.
