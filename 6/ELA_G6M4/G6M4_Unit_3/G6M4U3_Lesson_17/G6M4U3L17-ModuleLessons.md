Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Work Times A and B: Students complete Part II of the End of Unit 3 Assessment. In Part II, students participate in a final collaborative discussion to reflect on their learning throughout the module, revisit the module’s guiding questions, and reflect on the value of learning about multiple perspectives (W.6.10, SL.6.1).

- In this lesson, the habit of character focus is on working to become an ethical person. The characteristics that students practice are respect, empathy, and compassion as they participate in a text-based discussion.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- One aim of this performance task is to help students make heard and known the stories of women in space science whose contributions have gone unsung. To heighten the impact of students’ work and broaden the audience who will benefit from the students’ work, make the books available as a resource for other students (e.g., by providing copies of the books in the school library or sharing them with a local historical organization).

- Extend the module reflection discussion by asking students what implications their learning has on their everyday lives. This serves as an opportunity to make a personal connection between the concepts and habits of characters learned throughout the module to the students’ lives.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Students have created and presented with their crewmates their picture book pages and completed the work of the module.

Support All Students

- To create a more manageable grading situation for the assessment, split the class in half. As one half of the class is participating in the discussion, the other half of the class can be independently working on another assignment unrelated to the assessment.

- If the class size is too large to facilitate a manageable discussion, use the Fishbowl protocol.

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment.

- Some students may require more than the time allotted to complete the assessment.

- To support ELLs, this lesson features Part II of the end of unit assessment, during which students participate in a culminating, collaborative discussion to respond to the guiding questions of the module. Before participating in the discussions, students have the opportunity to write a QuickWrite in response to the guiding questions, allowing ELLs time to put their thoughts and ideas to words.

- ELLs may find it challenging to respond to the module guiding questions, which are wide in scope and whose responses pull from learning across the module. Remind students of all they have accomplished over the course of the module. Point out the value of reflecting on large-scale ideas at the end of a module. Invite students to imagine how they felt on the first day of the module guiding questions, when the module was first introduced, as a way to highlight the growth that has taken place since then.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.2, 6.I.A.3, and 6.I.A.4.

Assessment Guidance

- The End of Unit 3 Assessment is included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback to students on this assessment, use End of Unit 3 Assessment Part II Recording Sheet to assess each student’s progress toward SL.6.1d, which has not been assessed previously is any module. Feel free to assess the remaining SL.6.1 substandards as appropriate.

Down the Road

- This is the final lesson of Module 4.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare the End of Unit 3 Assessment (see Assessment Overview and Resources).

- If splitting the class to create a more manageable discussion, prepare an independent assignment for students to complete as they are waiting to participate in the discussion.

- Gather students’ Track Progress folders, and organize for distribution.

- Count out stacks of seven sticky notes for each student to use on their Track Progress form.

- Review the student tasks and example answers to get familiar with what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Prepare copies of handouts for students, including entrance ticket (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time A: Use recording technology to capture all student discussion. Recordings can then be accessed later by the students for self-assessment and reflection and/or for summative assessment after the lesson ends.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – SL.6.1 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as in previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons. Invite students to choose a habit of character focus for themselves for this lesson.

- Focus students on the **Discussion Norms anchor chart**. Invite students to Turn and Talk to an elbow partner and share one criterion they want to focus on during their discussion today, and why.

Work Time

A. QuickWrite – W.6.10 (10 minutes)

- Distribute and display **End of Unit 3 Assessment Part II: Collaborative Discussion**.

- Read aloud the directions for the assessment as students follow along silently. Ensure all students understand the assessment directions. Answer their questions, refraining from supplying answers to the assessment questions themselves.

- Invite students to begin composing their QuickWrite. Refer to the **End of Unit 3 Assessment Part II: Collaborative Discussion (example for teacher reference)**.

- After 5 minutes have passed, refocus students whole group.

For Lighter Support

- Before the assessment of Work Time A, underline key vocabulary in the assessment directions and prompt (e.g.*, two parts, collaborative discussion, QuickWrite, module guiding questions*). Read the directions aloud together as a class to ensure that students understand each task included in the assessment. Invite students who need lighter support to restate or clarify information for students who need heavier support.

For Heavier Support

N/A

Work Time

B. End of Unit 3 Assessment Part II: Collaborative Discussion – SL.6.1 (20 minutes)

- Direct students back to the Discussion Norms anchor chart, specifically on the cues and responses. Remind students that a discussion is not just about saying what we want to say. Effective participation is about listening to others and asking and answering questions. Questions help us to be completely clear about what others are saying and to clarify our own points. Inform students that it’s important they build off one another’s ideas and ask questions of their peers to deepen their understanding throughout the discussion.

- Remind students that a focus standard for this discussion is SL.6.1: Review the key ideas expressed and demonstrate understanding of multiple perspectives through reflection and paraphrasing.

- Focus students on the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**. Remind students that it is not easy for everyone to participate in a discussion. Uplift the habits of respect, compassion, and empathy in preparation for the discussion.

- Begin the discussion, using the guiding questions. Use the **End of Unit 3 Assessment Part II Recording Sheet** to assess students as they participate for SL.6.1d (and any additional SL.6.1 substandards as desired).

“What were the main events of the Space Race, and in what scientific, political, and social context did it take place?” (Responses will vary, but may include any or all of the following:

- The Space Race was an international competition of space exploration that began with the USSR launching the Sputnik satellite and culminated with the United States sending the first human being to the moon in 1969 during the Apollo 11 mission.

- Scientifically, sending a human being to the moon seemed an impossible undertaking that required deep understanding of many scientific phenomena (e.g., wind tunnels, supersonic flight, trajectories, advanced aircraft).

- Politically, the United States and the USSR were at odds, and the Space Race became a symbol of innovation and power.

- Socially, the Space Race took place at a time of rampant discrimination against black Americans in the United States. At that time, women of all races were also generally excluded from well-paying jobs in math and science.)

“What were the accomplishments of the ‘hidden figures’ at NACA, and why were they remarkable?” (Responses will vary, but may include any or all of the following:

- The West End Computers at NACA, or the hidden figures, impacted scientific progress by using their exceptional talents in math and science to advance key projects in space science.

- The hidden figures impacted social progress by serving as the first black women to take on positions at NACA, including leadership positions.

- The hidden figures used their personal strength and professional talents to help themselves, their families, their communities, NACA, and the United States, thus contributing to a better world.)

“Why is it important to study the accomplishments of the ‘hidden figures’ and of others whose stories have gone unrecognized?” (Responses will vary, but may include any or all of the following:

- Hidden figures are often “hidden” due to discrimination in the way history is written.

- Our study of history is most accurate when we celebrate the contributions of all involved.

- The accomplishments of hidden figures are remarkable, especially because they are achieved in the face of adversity.)

- If the conversation wanes, use some of the following prompts to spark new ideas:

“What connections can you see between and among the four modules this year?”

“How has your thinking changed, grown, evolved, been challenged, been extended throughout our studies this year?”

“What surprised you the most this year in terms of something you learned about the content we studied, the world, about yourself, about your abilities, about your peers?”

Closing and Assessment

A. Track Progress: Collaborative Discussion – SL.6.1 (10 Minutes)

- Give students specific positive feedback on their completion of the End of Unit 3 Assessment (e.g., “I was pleased to see a lot of you referring to your note-catchers to find details”).

- Distribute **Track Progress: Collaborative Discussion** and **Track Progress folders**. Tell students that successful learners keep track of and reflect on their own learning.

- Distribute the **Writing Record**. Explain that this form can help students to keep track of all of the writing they complete this year. Direct students to fill in the next row of the Writing Record about the children’s book pages and the QuickWrite they just completed for the End of Unit 3 Assessment.

- Invite students to place the form in their Track Progress folder, and collect students’ folders.

- Congratulate students on successfully completing the performance task, Module 4, and the year.
