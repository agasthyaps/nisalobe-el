**Sentence**

**“Tell me where you want his spaceship to land, and I’ll tell you where to launch it,”** Katherine told her boss. (from *Hidden Figures* \[Picture Book\] by Margot Lee Shetterly)

Launch

Before beginning the Language Dive, make sure students can easily access the Characteristics of Narrative Nonfiction anchor chart. Students may wish to refer to the anchor chart to help them answer questions during the Language Dive.

“Tell me where you want his spaceship to land, and I’ll tell you where to launch it,”

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Ask:

“What do you notice about this chunk?” (Responses will vary, but may include that it has quotation marks, which means that it is a direct quote, spoken by one person to another.)

“Who said this quote? To whom was she speaking? If you need to, you can look at the picture book to help you find the answer.” (Katherine Johnson said this quote. She was speaking to her boss.)

“Most likely, Katherine did not say this exact quote. Can you figure out why the writer presented this exchange as dialogue rather as a typical description?” (Responses will vary, but may include: the writer probably presented this exchange in dialogue because the direct quote helps give the reader a clear sense of who Katherine is.)

- Invite students to make connections to the section of the Characteristics of Narrative Nonfiction anchor chart that describes dialogue in narrative nonfiction. Remind students that the dialogue presented in narrative nonfiction might not be exact. Instead, it is often representative of what historical figures <u>might</u> have said, based on the information that the writer has researched.

- **Tell me . . . and I’ll tell you**

“Can you figure out why Shetterly and Freeman might have included this parallel structure in the sentence?” (Responses will vary, but may include: Sentences with parallel structure can be clearer or have a better rhythm. In this case, the parallel structure helps emphasize the idea that Katherine had a strong idea about what work she should be doing and what work her boss should be doing.)

- If necessary, tell students that **parallel structure** describes a repeated grammatical in a sentence; alternatively, challenge students to make an educated guess about what **parallel structure** is based on their understanding of the words **parallel** and **structure**.

“What does this chunk illustrate about Katherine’s personality?” (Responses will vary, but may include: This quote illustrates that Katherine is confident in her math skills. She believes in what she can do and she shows initiative. This chunk also suggests that she might feel impatient with the way her boss treats her. She wants to be trusted and given responsibility at work.)

- **Students can use Conversation Cues as they discuss. To provide heavier support, display a suggested sequence, such as the one below:**

- I’ll give you time to discuss this with a partner. (Goal 1)

- Who can tell us what your classmate said in your own words? (Goal 2)

- Do you agree or disagree with what your classmate said? Why? (Goal 4)

- How does this discussion add to your understanding of narrative nonfiction writing?  
  (Goal 3)

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Students can complete the sentence frame to practice the parallel structure in the sentence. Tell students that variations of this frame are common in familiar sayings (e.g., Tell me who your friends are, and I will tell you who you are). These sayings suggest that there are certain behaviors that are revealing of a person’s humanity.

> Tell me \_\_\_\_\_\_, and I will tell you who you are. (Tell me what you like to read, and I will tell you who you are.)  Step 3

- To provide lighter support: Challenge students to make their sentences more unique by using the following frame: Tell me \_\_\_\_\_\_, and I will tell you \_\_\_\_\_\_.

- To provide heavier support: Show additional examples to support student comprehension of the frame and spark creativity. Examples might include: **Tell me what you do when you are alone, and I will tell you who you are. Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you who you are. Tell me how you feel on a rainy day, and I will tell you who you are.**

> “What do you think will follow this chunk in the sentence?” (Responses will vary, but may include: what might follow is a description of who was speaking and to whom.)

Katherine told her boss.

Deconstruct

- Ask:

“Why is it important to include a chunk like this in sentences that contain dialogue?” (It is important because the reader needs to know who is speaking and to whom.)

“What other verbs could the writer have used instead of told? How would the structure and tone of the chunk change if you used these synonyms?” (Responses will vary, but may include: The writer could have used words like said, exclaimed, or shouted. Each of these verbs would require a preposition \[e.g., Katherine said to her boss\].)

“Tell me where you want his spaceship to  
land, and I’ll tell you where to launch it,” Katherine told her boss.

Reconstruct

- Ask:

“What characteristics of narrative nonfiction are featured in this sentence?” (This sentence conveys factual information in a story-like format. The sentence uses dialogue, which is a technique of literary storytelling. The sentence portrays Katherine more like a character in a story.)

“What if this event were described in an informational text? How might the writing or author’s methods be different?” (Responses will vary, but may include: If this event were described in an informational text, there probably would not be a quote. The text might use inner thoughts or description instead. Katherine might feel like less of a character as a result.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence? I’ll give you a minute to sketch the meaning of this sentence on your note-catchers.”  Step 4 (Responses will vary.)

- Alternatively, invite students to role-play the sentence, with one student playing Katherine and the other playing the boss. Students can imagine the boss’s response and use body language and facial expressions to suggest how both people feel during this exchange. Students can do this in pairs, or half the class could be Katherine and half the boss, standing across from one another, and all role-play as two groups.

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target I can identify the characteristics of narrative nonfiction writing?” (Responses will vary.)

“How can you use similar characteristics of narrative nonfiction in the picture books you are writing about your focus figures?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice (Sentence)

- Students can use this sentence frame to write a quote that their focus figure might have really said. Remind students that they should include who said the quote and, if necessary, to whom they said it. Students can also use the frame to make a quote that the focus figure might have said to him/herself.

> **“\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_,”\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**
>
> (“I wonder if I can make my <u>own</u> eclipse,” Wang Zhenyi thought to herself.)  Step 5

- To provide lighter support: challenge students to use an **as** clause at the end of the frame, to give more information about what the focus figure was doing when the quote was uttered (e.g., “I wonder if I can make my <u>own</u> eclipse,” Wang Zhenyi thought to herself as she looked into the sky).

- To provide heavier support: offer a list of verbs that students can use to complete the sentence frame (e.g., **thought**, **wondered**, **said**, **added**, **clarified**, **exclaimed**).

Language Chunk Wall Suggestions

- Language to connect words, phrases, clauses: **“Tell me where you want his spaceship to land, <u>and</u> I’ll tell you where to launch it,”**

- Language to make references: **Katherine told <u>her</u> boss.**

- Language to capture a reader’s imagination or attention: **“Tell me where you want his spaceship to land, and I’ll tell you where to launch it,”**
