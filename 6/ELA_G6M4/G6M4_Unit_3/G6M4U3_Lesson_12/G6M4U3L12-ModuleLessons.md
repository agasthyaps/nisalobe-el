Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.6.7 – Opening A: Students examine the illustrations in narrative nonfiction picture books. They integrate information presented in the illustrations and in the text to develop a more coherent understanding of the narrative nonfiction genre overall.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time A: Students participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from the *Hidden Figures* picture book (*Hidden Figures: The True Story of Four Black Women and the Space Race*). They use textual evidence to support their analysis of the sentence and the text.

- RI.6.3 – Work Time A: During the Language Dive, students analyze the way in which Katherine Johnson’s character is illustrated in the picture book.

- W.6.3 – Work Time A: During the Language Dive, students examine the features of narrative nonfiction writing that are present in the sentence.

- W.6.3 – Work Time B: Students work with their crewmates to draft their narrative nonfiction picture book pages, using effective narrative techniques.

- W.6.4 – Work Time B: Students work with their crewmates to develop clear and coherent writing with attention to task, purpose, and audience.

- W.6.5 – Work Time B: With support from their crewmates, students develop and strengthen writing through the process of planning and drafting their narrative nonfiction picture book pages.

- SL.6.5 – Work Time B: Students develop illustrations to clarify information in their picture book pages.

- RI.6.7 – Closing and Assessment A: Students analyze the illustrations of model performance tasks, integrating the visual information provided by the illustrations with the information provided in the text.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners, collaborating with their crewmates, taking initiative, and showing responsibility as they continue drafting the text and illustrations for their performance task.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Among the characteristics of narrative nonfiction students may notice in the model texts is the use of text features, such as a foreword, timeline, glossary, author’s note, and primary source photographs of the historical events and people depicted in the story. Challenge students to go beyond writing and illustrating their own section of the class story by enhancing the class book with these additional text features.

- If possible, collaborate with the art teacher to provide some basic lessons on illustrating picture books or manipulating computer-generated images, as students begin adding visuals to their picture books.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students launched the performance task by examining the characteristics of narrative nonfiction. They examined several models of children’s picture books in the narrative nonfiction genre, including the picture book version of *Hidden Figures*, and compiled an anchor chart of common characteristics. Crews began planning and drafting the text of their own children’s picture book about another hidden figure in space science. This lesson extends that learning by examining, specifically, the illustrations in narrative nonfiction picture books and how they add meaning to the story. Students continue drafting their story with their crews and begin creating the illustrations (either hand-drawn or computer-generated).

Support All Students

- Support students as they incorporate illustrations into their picture books. This also provides a more manageable workload for some ELLs, for whom writing is especially challenging. ▲ Point students toward free resources that provide high-quality images, such as http://eled.org/0181 or http://eled.org/0147, for students who are not inclined toward original illustrations. Remind students that it is the thinking and presentation skills that are being practiced; students are not being assessed on their artistic talents.

- It may be challenging for some students to stay on task for an extended period of time. Help students break up the time by encouraging them to set a series of small goals to track their progress and maintain their pace. Group those who will find this challenging to work with support.

- ELLs may be especially concerned that the language of their performance task materials is used correctly. Help students locate and remedy language errors that affect overall clarity of ideas, while also reminding students that language errors are okay and that they will not be formally assessed on this assignment. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson features a Language Dive that centers around a sentence from the *Hidden Figures* picture book, which includes several elements that are typical of narrative nonfiction writing. In examining these elements, students reinforce their learning from the previous lesson and feel more prepared to generate their own narrative nonfiction writing in their picture book pages. Also in this lesson, students collaborate to write text and draw illustrations for their picture book pages. Because these picture books are meant for an audience of younger readers and have a strong visual component, the demands of the assignment do not disadvantage ELLs who need heavier support with writing.

- ELLs may find it challenging to create their narrative nonfiction picture book pages in a limited amount of time. Remind students that their homework is devoted to continued preparation of their illustrations and text. Check in with students who may benefit from additional time to develop a plan for maximizing their homework time.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.2, 6.I.A.4, 6.I.B.6, 6.I.C.10, 6.I.C.12, 6.II.A.1, 6.II.A.2, 6.II.B.3, 6.II.B.4, 6.II.B.5, 6.II.C.6, and 6.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- The performance tasks at the end of every module are neither formative nor summative assessments. For these reasons, it is recommended that performance tasks be evaluated only through the lens of the attributes of high-quality student work (authenticity, complexity, and craftsmanship). View the Performance Task Overview for specific criteria related to each attribute.

- Remind students that they are not being assessed on the quality or content of their contribution to the class anthology of focus figures. Rather the End of Unit 3 Assessment requires students to trace and evaluate the arguments being made through the narrative nonfiction stories. Students practice these skills in Lessons 5 and 10, using the same note-catchers they will use during the assessment in Lessons 15–16.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue drafting and illustrating their narrative nonfiction contribution to the class picture book about other hidden figures in space science. Models and structured work time ensure students have the materials and time necessary to produce high-quality work. Students will also begin thinking about how they will present the argument in their narrative nonfiction text, as their presentation of this argument is how they will be assessed for the End of Unit 3 Assessment.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.6.7 (5 minutes)

- Lay out **several examples of narrative nonfiction picture books** from the list on the **Characteristics of Narrative Nonfiction anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**. Invite students to retrieve the two books they browsed through in the last lesson. Remind students that these books represent the narrative nonfiction genre. Inform students that they will be specifically focusing on the illustrations in the two books.

- Distribute several **sticky notes** to each student. Explain that as they browse through the books, they should record their answers to the following question: “How do the illustrations enhance a reader’s experience with the book?”

- Circulate and monitor as students browse. Push students to support their responses with examples from the texts (e.g., “Your sticky note says the books often include highly detailed illustrations. Can you show me where you saw that in the texts?”)

- Focus student attention on the displayed **Characteristics of Narrative Nonfiction anchor chart**. Using a total participation technique, gather student responses to add to the anchor chart. Refer to the Characteristics of Narrative Nonfiction anchor chart (example for teacher reference) for guidance.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as in previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons. Invite students to choose a habit of character focus for themselves for this lesson.

Work Time

A. Language Dive: *Hidden Figures* Picture Book – W.6.3, SL.6.1 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify the characteristics of narrative nonfiction writing.”

- Tell students they will now participate in a Language Dive to examine a sentence from *Hidden Figures (Picture Book)*. Students will identify the characteristics of narrative nonfiction writing that are featured in the sentence.

- Tell students they will now begin the Language Dive. Reread aloud the excerpt from *Hidden Figures (Picture Book)* that begins “The people at the laboratory had to work together from morning to night to figure out how to send astronaut John Glenn into space . . . .” Finish at the end of the page.

- Focus students on the sentence:

- “Tell me where you want his spaceship to land, and I’ll tell you where to launch it,” Katherine told her boss.

- Use the **Language Dive Guide: *Hidden Figures*** **Picture Book (for teacher reference)** and the **Language Dive: *Hidden Figures*** **Picture Book Sentence Chunk Chart (for teacher reference)** to guide students through a Language Dive conversation about the sentence. Distribute and display the **Language Dive: *Hidden Figures*** **Picture Book note-catcher**, and the **Language Dive: *Hidden Figures*** **Picture Book sentence chunk strips**. Refer to the **Language Dive: *Hidden Figures*** **Picture Book note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- As an extension to the Language Dive of Work Time A, challenge students who need lighter support to rewrite the Language Dive sentence for different genres of writing. For example, instead of using narrative nonfiction writing techniques, students can rewrite the sentence to include characteristics of informational writing. This remediation exercise may help clarify expectations of the narrative nonfiction writing assignment.

For Heavier Support

- As an extension to the Language Dive of Work Time A and to reinforce work with RI.6.7, invite students who need heavier support to closely examine the illustration that accompanies the Language Dive sentence in the picture book. Students can discuss how the illustration adds to their understanding of the text and vice versa.

Work Time

B. Draft Narrative Nonfiction Picture Book – W.6.3, W.6.5 (20 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can draft a narrative nonfiction text about my focus figure’s remarkable accomplishments.”

- Invite students to join their three-person crews. Ask students to retrieve their **Performance Task: Picture Book directions**. By now students should have already completed steps 1 and 2 under Mission Objectives.

- Focus students on step 3: “Collaborate on the completion of the narrative nonfiction picture book, sharing duties as authors, illustrators, and editors with the rest of your crew.”

- Explain that this one step requires several smaller tasks to be completed.

- Turn and Talk with crews:

“What smaller tasks need to be completed before moving on to step 4?” (Write the text; type the text; edit the text; draw the illustrations or find them online; check that the illustrations match the action; lay out the book pages with the text and illustrations; check for proper grammar and conventions; publish the book either on paper or online.)

- Explain that, just like the astronaut crews, each person in the student crews will take responsibility for their specific and specialized tasks. Crews should decide who will take the lead on writing the text, creating the illustrations, and editing and formatting both. Each member of the crew should circle their role on the directions sheet and jot down their specific responsibilities.

- Encourage students to think metacognitively about what kinds of planners might work best for their team (e.g., storyboard, graphic organizer, T-chart with text ideas on one side and illustration ideas on the other). Make clear that students are being trusted to take responsibility and initiative for completing this task.

- Invite students to refer to the following materials as needed:

- **Performance Task anchor chart**

- **Independent Argument Evidence note-catcher**

- Characteristics of Narrative Nonfiction anchor chart

- Examples of narrative nonfiction picture books

- **Text: *Hidden Figures (Picture Book)***

- Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**. Draw their attention to the habit of character *initiative*. Remind students of what this means and what it looks like (I see what needs to be done and take the lead on making responsible decisions; doing things without being asked).

- Provide students with **art supplies** they may need to create their illustrations, such as blank paper, construction paper, colored pencils or markers, and scissors, and **devices**.

- Direct students to websites where they can access free, high-quality stock photos and clip art, such as http://eled.org/0147 or http://eled.org/0181.

- Release crews to begin working.

- As students work, circulate to answer questions, push their thinking, and provide support as needed. Remind them to review the model picture books and the anchor chart to help them make decisions and to also use one another as thought-partners. Guide students to include the most effective and relevant information to demonstrate why the focus figure’s accomplishments were so remarkable.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Closing and Assessment

A. Compare and Contrast Illustrations of Model Performance Tasks – RI.6.7 (5 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can create effective visuals to accompany my narrative nonfiction text about my focus figure’s remarkable accomplishments.”

- Display the **Model Performance Task: Mae Jemison**, and read it aloud.

- Display the **Model Performance Task: Wang Zhenyi** as well.

- Ask:

“How do the illustrations in each text differ?” (The illustrations in the Wang Zhenyi text are computer generated; the illustrations in the Mae Jemison text are hand drawn.)

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What are the benefits and drawbacks of each type of illustration?” (Responses will vary, but may include: The computer-generated illustrations are more precise and professional, but they are hard to customize for our texts. The hand-drawn illustrations are exactly what we want them to be, but drawing takes more time and there may not be a crewmate who feels comfortable drawing the pictures by hand.)

- Remind students that both options are acceptable. Students are not being assessed on their narrative nonfiction stories or the quality of their illustrations. They are encouraged to aim for high-quality craftsmanship but they should have fun with the process, hone new skills, and take risks.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Prepare Narrative Nonfiction and Illustrations

- Students continue to prepare the illustrations and text for their contribution to the children’s picture book about other hidden figures in space science.
