Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.6.8 – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they practice recording basic bibliographic information for sources that they have used in their focus figure research.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time A: Students conduct research for their independent argument essays about their focus figures. They add textual evidence to their Independent Argument Evidence note-catchers.

- RI.6.3 – Work Time A: Students analyze the way in which writers illustrate and elaborate on the accomplishments of their focus figure in the sources they find, and they add notes to their note-catchers.

- W.6.1 – Work Time A: Students add relevant evidence to their note-catchers, which they will use to write arguments that support claims about their focus figures.

- W.6.7 – Work Time A: Students conduct research about a focus figure, who will serve as the subject of their independent argument essays.

- W.6.8 – Work Time A: As students conduct research, they gather relevant information from multiple sources. They paraphrase data to avoid plagiarism and provide bibliographic information for each source.

- W.6.9b – Work Time A: Students gather relevant evidence from multiple sources to write arguments that support claims about their focus figures.

- W.6.7 – Work Time B: Students participate in a debrief about their focus figure research.

- The research reading that students complete for homework helps build both their vocabulary and knowledge pertaining to space science. By participating in this volume of reading over time, students will develop a wide base of knowledge about the world and the words that help describe and make sense of it.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- The entrance ticket requires students to practice citing a research source using proper MLA formatting. Teach students to also include in-text citations in their essays using proper MLA formatting.

- Encourage students to express what they have learned from their independent research reading task using multimodalities. Students could create a collage, podcast, poem, or game to synthesize their learning.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students analyzed a model argument essay about hidden figure Dorothy Vaughan and then wrote practice argument essays with partners about one of the other hidden figures featured in the anchor text. In this lesson, students continue to conduct research about their chosen focus figures in preparation for planning and composing their independent argument essays over three lessons.

Support All Students

- Revisit some of the research mini lessons in Module 2 for students who seem overwhelmed by the research task.

- Without strategies in place for screening out irrelevant information and staying focused on the purpose for research, students may struggle to efficiently conduct independent research in class. Brainstorm simple strategies for effective online reading, and post these for students to reference. Some of these strategies may include:

- Click on relevant hyperlinks, but wait to read the linked site until you have finished with the original site.

- Bookmark all URLs as you read, or copy and paste them in a separate document, so that you can easily find them again later.

- Do not have more than three tabs open at one time.

- As students research their focus figures during Work Time B, monitor their progress and use Goal 3 Conversation Cues to help students deepen their thinking and improve their metacognition:

- What strategies have helped you succeed in your research?

- How does your research add to your understanding of your focus figure and of the argument essay?

- Display a timer to count down the 20 minutes during Work Time A. Remind students that this is the last research session they have before they write their essays for the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment; staying on task is critical.

- To support ELLs, this lesson includes built-in research time that will help students develop the claims and reasons of their independent argument essays, which they plan during the following lesson and write during the mid-unit assessment. After independent research time, students have the opportunity to debrief with their crewmates to share findings. These processes are important for all students, including ELLs, who may especially benefit from the opportunity to collaborate and have clarifying questions addressed.

- ELLs may find it challenging to complete their independent research about their focus figures, and since this is the last research opportunity students will have before they plan and write their essays, it is important that this session is a productive one. Before Work Time A, consider checking in with individuals or small groups of ELLs who need heavier support to gauge their research progress and help them develop goals for the research session.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1 and 6.I.B.6.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ entries on their Independent Argument Evidence note-catcher to ensure that recorded textual evidence is appropriate, relevant, and comprehensive. Remind students that this note-catcher serves as preparation for the independent essays they will write in the next three lessons; the more effort they put into the note-catcher now, the easier the writing task will be later.

- Circulate and monitor during the independent research reading share to help students make connections between their independent reading and their learning about the module topic.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will plan their independent argument essays, based on the research they have been gathering. Students will be given two lessons to compose their independent essay for the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Gather computers or tablets necessary for students to begin research online during Work Time A. Ensure computers are logged in and in good working order. Provide plenty of research texts as well; a resurgence of interest in this topic has led to a number of newly published books that uncover hidden figures as students will be doing for the performance task.

- Become familiar with several of the focus figures from the Focus Figures Options List; be prepared to direct students toward resources that will help them complete their research about their chosen focus figure.

- Prepare for the research reading share using the Independent Reading Sample Plans document (see the Tools page: http://eled.org/tools), or use another independent reading routine for students to reflect on and share what they have learned about the module topic from their independent work.

- Review the student tasks and example answers to get familiar with what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Prepare copies of handouts for students, including entrance ticket (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time B: Provide computers or tablets for students to conduct online research.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.6.8 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as in previous lessons to distribute and review the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 6**. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 6 (example for teacher reference)** for possible responses. Students will also need their **Independent Argument Evidence note-catcher**.

- Turn and Talk:

“Why is it important to properly cite our sources when conducting research?” (To give credit to the authors who have provided the information. To help readers who want to know more about our topic to access our original sources. To avoid plagiarism.)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as in previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons. Invite students to choose a habit of character focus for themselves for this lesson.

Work Time

A. Research Focus Figure – W.6.7, W.6.8 (20 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can conduct a short research project, draw on several sources, and gather relevant information about my focus figure.

- Students will now have an opportunity to continue researching their focus figure. Pause to have students review the research they have already completed and consider the best place to resume their research. Have students mark the places where they need additional information on their note-catchers. Remind students that this is the last research session they have before they write their essays for the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment; staying on task is critical.

- Distribute **devices for online research**. Remind students that when working on technology, it is important to uplift the habit of integrity by only accessing the relevant information needed for their research. As necessary, use the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart** to review *integrity*.

- Invite students to begin individually researching their focus figure, gathering information on the Independent Argument Evidence note-catcher. Circulate and monitor student activity. Refer to **Independent Argument Evidence note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time A, as students research their focus figures, consider seating students who need heavier support near one another and monitoring their progress.

Work Time

B. Debrief: Focus Figure Research – W.6.7 (5 minutes)

- Move students back together with their crewmates. Invite them to share what they learned during their research time. Crewmates should update their Independent Argument Evidence note-catcher accordingly. Remind students that they will write their essays independently, but they will work together to create their children’s book pages.

- Remind students to indicate the sources they used and connect which pieces of evidence come from which sources.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time B, as crewmates share what they learned during research time, it may be challenging for students who need heavier support to quickly and concisely relay their findings to crewmates. Invite groups to use equity sticks, Brain Balls, or some other mechanism for tracking contributions and ensuring that each student has a chance to share ideas aloud.

Closing and Assessment

A. Share Independent Research Reading – RL.6.10, RI.6.10 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can share my independent research reading with my peers.”

- Refer to the **Independent Reading Sample Plans** to guide students through a research reading share, or use another routine.

- Remind students that this is the final sharing of independent research reading for the unit and that the purpose of research reading is to build their content knowledge, domain-specific vocabulary, and achievement on reading complex texts. Praise students for demonstrating integrity by keeping up with their independent research reading even though it might have been challenging.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their habit of character focus for this lesson.

Homework

A. Research Focus Figure

- Students continue to research their focus figure and document information on the Independent Argument Evidence note-catcher.
