Performance Task Presentation Checklist

**Name:** **Date:**

**Directions:** Rehearse the presentation of your Performance Task: Hidden Figures in Space Science Picture Book, checking to ensure that all of the following criteria are included in your presentation. Check off whether the criterion needs improvement (Still in Liftoff) or if it has been successfully incorporated into the presentation (Mission Accomplished!).

Put the initials of the crewmate next to the task(s) for which they are responsible, in the **Designated Crewmate** column. Each crewmate should be responsible for at least one of the four main parts of the presentation: introduction, reason 1, reason 2, or conclusion. *Note:* All crewmates should initial the final criterion on the list!
