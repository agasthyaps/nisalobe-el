Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- SL.6.3 – Opening A: Students examine the Performance Task Presentation checklist. They prepare to delineate the arguments and specific claims of their classmates during the performance task.

- SL.6.4 – Opening A: Students prepare to present the claims and findings of their focus figure research.

- W.6.3 – Work Time A: Students participate in a mini lesson aimed at helping them use appropriate and effective narrative writing techniques in their picture book pages.

- W.6.3 – Work Time B: Students continue to draft their narrative nonfiction picture book pages, using effective narrative techniques.

- W.6.4 – Work Time B: Students work with their crewmates to develop clear and coherent writing with attention to task, purpose, and audience.

- W.6.5 – Work Time B: With support from their crewmates, students continue to develop and strengthen writing through the process of planning and drafting their narrative nonfiction picture book pages.

- SL.6.5 – Work Time B: Students continue develop illustrations to clarify information in their picture book pages.

- W.6.3 – Closing and Assessment A: Students participate in a peer share of their narrative nonfiction picture book pages, noting the strengths and places for improvement in their classmates’ narrative nonfiction writing.

- W.6.5 – Closing and Assessment A: With guidance and support from their peers during the peer share, students strengthen their writing through revising and polishing.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners, collaborating with their crewmates, taking initiative, and showing responsibility as they continue drafting the text and illustrations for their performance task.

- Previous modules have given students a more formal opportunity to revise and edit their performance task products. In this module, the lessons have been written to embed revision and editing throughout the process.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Time in this lesson has been allotted for a mini lesson on narrative techniques. Rather than reviewing one technique, set up stations with activities that review several narrative techniques. Invite students to rotate through the different stations to brush up on practice with punctuating dialogue, developing character traits, incorporating sensory language and descriptive detail, and/or “show, don’t tell.”

- Some students may experience frustration working with crewmates if they are used to taking the lead and have a specific vision of what the end product should be. Validate their feelings, and coach them to communicate with their peers in a way that motivates others, such as asking questions rather than making demands. Assign them other parts of the book creation process over which they can have full control, such as adding a timeline, foreword, photographs, or cover art.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Throughout the second half of this unit, students have been analyzing model narrative nonfiction texts and incorporating the elements of this genre into their original stories about a key individual in space science who is worthy of recognition. Students have worked in triads to compose the text and design the illustrations for their section of the class book on this topic. In this lesson, students continue this work, keeping in mind the specific criteria on which they will be assessed—their ability to orally present their argument that their focus figure’s achievements are truly remarkable.

Support All Students

- Encourage a sense of celebration around the creation of the performance task. Students may lose momentum as they reach the conclusion of the module. Remind them that the purpose of this activity is not to earn a grade but rather learning for learning’s sake. Emphasize the authenticity of the task by making connections to professions that require the skills students are honing by working on this task.

- ELLs may be especially concerned that the language of their performance task materials is used correctly. Help students locate and remedy language errors that affect overall clarity of ideas, while also reminding students that language errors are okay and that they will not be formally assessed on this assignment. ▲

- Encourage students to set small, individualized goals for their performance in the presentation of their books, specifically in the argument they are proposing through their narrative nonfiction text. Provide index cards or sticky notes for them to record their personal stars and steps for their portion of the assignment.

- To support ELLs, this lesson features additional time for students to complete their narrative nonfiction picture book pages. A guided mini lesson offers further instruction in narrative nonfiction techniques. A peer share at the end of the lesson gives students a supportive and low-stakes way of giving and receiving feedback that can help them improve their pages for the picture book.

- ELLs may continue to find it challenging to complete their narrative nonfiction pages and preserve enough time to adequately revise and polish their work. Work with students to divide final responsibilities (e.g., coloring the final illustrations, proofreading the pages, comparing the narrative features of the pages against the Characteristics of Narrative Nonfiction Writing anchor chart) to complete during the work time of the following lesson.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.4, 6.I.B.6, 6.I.C.10, 6.I.C.12, 6.II.A.1, 6.II.A.2, 6.II.B.3, 6.II.B.4, 6.II.B.5, 6.II.C.6, and 6.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- The performance tasks at the end of every module are neither formative nor summative assessments. For these reasons, it is recommended that performance tasks be evaluated only through the lens of the attributes of high-quality student work (authenticity, complexity, and craftsmanship).

- Remind students that they are not being assessed on the quality or content of their contribution to the class anthology of focus figures. Rather, the End of Unit 3 Assessment requires students to trace and evaluate the arguments being made through the narrative nonfiction stories. Students will practice these skills in Lessons 5 and 10, using the same note-catchers they will use during the assessment in Lessons 15–16.

- To demonstrate evidence of SL.6.4, each student will need to take responsibility for at least one of the four main parts of the presentation: introduction, reason 1, reason 2, or conclusion.

- Require students to use at least one of the sentence frames provided in Closing and Assessment A to assess SL.6.2.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will finish their books and rehearse their presentations in preparation for the End of Unit 3 Assessment, for which students will present their arguments and claims to peers, sequencing their ideas logically; using relevant descriptions, facts, and details to highlight main ideas; and demonstrating appropriate eye contact, adequate volume, and clear pronunciation. While each crew is presenting, students in the audience will delineate their classmates’ arguments, citing the textual evidence used to support their claims.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Determine a narrative technique to be the focus of the mini lesson in Work Time A. Identify an aspect of narrative writing in which students need additional practice, such as punctuating dialogue, developing character traits, incorporating sensory language, or embellishing with descriptive details. Review the standards for narrative writing (W.6.3) and the Narrative Writing checklist (introduced in Module 1) for guidance. As needed, refer back to lessons in Module 1, Unit 3 where these techniques were first introduced.

- Gather art supplies and computers/tablets students will need to create their illustrations (see Materials list).

- Gather several examples of narrative nonfiction picture books. Several options are listed on the Characteristics of Narrative Nonfiction anchor chart (example for teacher reference).

- Provide devices with word-processing capability for crews to type their texts.

- Review the student tasks and example answers to get familiar with what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Prepare copies of handouts for students, including entrance ticket (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time B: Prepare materials and technology for students to access online resources for high-quality photographs, illustrations, and clipart, such as http://eled.org/0147 or http://eled.org/0181, for their visuals if they do not want to create their own. Choose the level of technology that is appropriate for the students and school resources, and guide students accordingly.

- Work Time B: Provide devices with word-processing capabilities for students to type their narrative nonfiction texts.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – SL.6.3, SL.6.4 (5 minutes)

- Distribute the **Performance Task Presentation checklist**. Remind students that they are not being assessed on their actual picture books but on their ability to present the argument conveyed via the picture book—why their focus figure’s accomplishments are remarkable.

- Read each item on the checklist aloud.

- Clarify that, as they did in Lessons 5 and 10, speakers will present their arguments and claims to peers, sequencing their ideas logically; using relevant descriptions, facts, and details to highlight main ideas; and demonstrating appropriate eye contact, adequate volume, and clear pronunciation. Listeners will delineate their classmates’ arguments, citing the textual evidence used to support their claims.

- Each crewmate should be responsible for at least one of the four main parts of the presentation: introduction, reason 1, reason 2, or conclusion.

- Explain that students will have time to rehearse their presentation in the next lesson. During their work time today, they should review their narrative nonfiction text to ensure that a clear argument with relevant evidence is being conveyed about their focus figure.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as in previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons. Invite students to choose a habit of character focus for themselves for this lesson.

Work Time

A. Mini Lesson: Narrative Writing Techniques – W.6.3 (10 minutes)

- Conduct a teacher-generated mini lesson on a narrative technique essential for students’ success in writing their narrative nonfiction texts. Determine an appropriate focus for this mini lesson based on students’ needs.

Work Time

B. Draft Narrative Nonfiction Picture Book Pages – W.6.3, W.6.5 (20 minutes)

- Review the learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can draft a narrative nonfiction text about my focus figure’s remarkable accomplishments.”

“I can create effective visuals to accompany my narrative nonfiction text about my focus figure’s remarkable accomplishments.”

- Direct students to join their three-person crews. Ask students to retrieve their **Performance Task: Picture Book directions**. Remind students that, in the previous lesson, they determined the tasks needed to complete step 3 under Mission Objectives and assigned themselves roles within the group. Students should continue in those roles during the work time in this lesson.

- Invite students to gather together the following materials as needed:

- **Performance Task anchor chart for Module 4**

- **Independent Argument Evidence note-catcher**

- **Characteristics of Narrative Nonfiction anchor chart**

- **Examples of narrative nonfiction picture books**

- **Text: *Hidden Figures (Picture Book)***

- Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**. Draw their attention to the habit of character *responsibility*. Remind students of what this means and what it looks like (this means I take ownership of my ideas, my work, my goals, and my actions).

- Provide students with **art supplies** they may need to create their illustrations, such as blank paper, construction paper, colored pencils or markers, and scissors, and **devices**.

- Direct students to websites where they can access free, high-quality stock photos and clip art, such as http://eled.org/0181 or http://eled.org/0147.

- Release crews to begin working.

- As students work, circulate to answer questions, push their thinking, and provide support as needed. Remind them to review the model picture books and the anchor chart to help them make decisions and to also use one another as thought-partners. Guide students to include the most effective and relevant information to demonstrate why the focus figure’s accomplishments were so remarkable.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Closing and Assessment

A. Peer Share: Narrative Nonfiction Picture Book – W.6.3, W.6.5 (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can provide kind, specific, and helpful feedback to my peers to help them refine and improve their picture book.”

- Direct crews to pair up and share their in-progress picture books for feedback. Each crewmate will give one star and one step to help improve the other crew’s story, illustrations, or strength of the argument being presented.

- Explain that feedback is often best presented in the form of a question that guides the presenters to elaborate on their response to the question and add more clarity for the audience.

- Post and read aloud the following sentence frames:

- “Can you say more about . . . ?”

- “Will you explain what you mean by . . . ?”

- “I found myself wondering . . . .”

- Direct students to use at least one of the sentence frames when giving feedback to the other crew. Students can also reference the Performance Task: Picture Book directions for the specific criteria about which they should be commenting. Invite students to begin.

- Once crews are done sharing, field any new questions about the specifics of the picture book or the presentations. Clarify that, in the next lesson, they will have time to finish their books and rehearse the presentation of their books to ensure they have included all of the details on which they will be assessed in Lessons 15–16.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- During the Peer Share of Closing and Assessment A, use strategic combinations of Conversation Cues to help students who need lighter support to challenge their thinking and listen carefully to their classmates:

- “Why do you think that?” (Goal 3)

- “Can you figure out why your classmates did it that way?” (Goal 3)

- “Can you repeat what your classmate said in your own words?” (Goal 2)

For Heavier Support

- During the Peer Share of Closing and Assessment A, use strategic combinations of Conversation Cues to help students who need heavier support to be understood and to understand the comments of others:

- “Can you say more about that?” (Goal 1)

- “Can you give an example?” (Goal 1)

- “Can you repeat what your classmate said?” (Goal 2)

Homework

A. Prepare Narrative Nonfiction and Illustrations

- Students continue to prepare the illustrations and text for their contribution to the children’s picture book about other hidden figures in space science.
