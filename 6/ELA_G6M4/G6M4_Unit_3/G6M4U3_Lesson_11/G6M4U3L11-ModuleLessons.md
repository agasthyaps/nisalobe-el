Remarkable Accomplishments in Space Science

Grade 6: Module 4: Unit 3: Lesson 11

Lesson Overview

Lesson Summary

For the final lessons of the module, students work with their crews to craft a children’s picture book version of their focus figure’s story. Each crew is responsible for contributing one section to the class anthology of stories about these focus figures. This lesson launches that work by examining the characteristics of narrative nonfiction for primary school readers to ensure students compose their own stories using these genre features.

Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.6.3 – Opening A: Students examine narrative nonfiction texts and record notices and wonderings about the genre of narrative nonfiction. This process prepares students to generate their own narratives about real events.

- W.6.3 – Work Time A: Students participate in a genre study of narrative nonfiction. They identify the techniques and characteristics that are typical of narrative nonfiction and determine the extent to which a picture book (*Hidden Figures: The True Story of Four Black Women and the Space Race*) contains the characteristics of narrative nonfiction.

- SL.6.2 – Work Time A: Students analyze a model narrative nonfiction text, interpreting information presented in diverse formats and explaining why the included information is effective.

- W.6.3 – Work Time B: Students work with their crewmates to draft their narrative nonfiction picture book pages. The narratives they produce describe real events using effective techniques, relevant descriptive details, and well-structured event sequences.

- W.6.5 – Work Time B: With support from their crewmates, students strengthen their writing through drafting, revising, and rewriting their narrative nonfiction picture book pages.

- W.6.3 – Closing and Assessment A: Students examine a model performance task, evaluating its use of narrative nonfiction writing and identifying the extent to which it demonstrates the criteria for the performance task.

- SL.6.2 – Closing and Assessment A: Students analyze a model performance task, interpreting information presented in diverse formats and explaining why the included information is effective.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners, collaborating with their crewmates as they begin drafting the text and illustrations for their performance task.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Among the characteristics of narrative nonfiction students may notice in the model texts is the use of text features, such as a foreword, timeline, glossary, author’s note, and primary source photographs of the historical events and people depicted in the story. Challenge students to go beyond writing and illustrating their section of the class story by enhancing the class book with these additional text features.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Students have been researching another underrepresented individual in space science, their focus figure. For the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment, they composed an essay about why that individual’s accomplishments were remarkable. For the final lessons of the module, students work with their crews to craft a children’s picture book version of their focus figure’s story. Each crew is responsible for contributing one section to the class anthology of stories about these focus figures. This lesson launches that work by examining the characteristics of narrative nonfiction for primary school readers to ensure students compose their own stories using these genre features.

Support All Students

- Help ELLs better understand the principles of narrative nonfiction writing by bringing in (or inviting them to bring in) examples of narrative nonfiction written in their home languages. Students can examine these texts in home-language pairs, reflect in writing on the key features of the text, and/or compare and contrast their home-language texts with *Hidden Figures (Picture Book)*. These activities both support ELLs’ understanding of the expectations of narrative nonfiction writing and highlight the value of their home languages as a resource for taking on new assignments in class. ▲

- Provide an optional writing planner or story board to aid students in mapping out the arc of their narratives before beginning to compose their narratives.

- Encourage students to carefully manage their time and delegate tasks. Break down the steps of the performance task into checklist form. Provide an estimated amount of time for each step. Include a line for crewmates to initial next to the steps for which they will be responsible.

- To support ELLs, this lesson prepares students for the Module 4 performance task, which involves creating pages for a whole-class picture book that celebrates the achievements of their focus figures. The focus figures that students base their picture book pages on are the same that students researched and wrote about in their independent argument essays. Remediating the information about their focus figures in multiple contexts and for multiple purposes is beneficial for all students, but especially for ELLs, for whom multiple exposures to the same content is likely to lead to major gains in comprehension.

- ELLs may find it challenging to identify features of narrative nonfiction quickly and thoroughly enough to contribute meaningfully to the Characteristics of Narrative Nonfiction anchor chart. It is important that this anchor chart is well-developed enough for students to measure their work against it in this and later lessons. Offer additional support as needed to ensure that contributions to the anchor chart are accurate and comprehensive.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.4, 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.7, 6.I.B.8, 6.I.C.10, 6.I.C.12, 6.II.A.1, 6.II.A.2, 6.II.B.3, 6.II.B.4, 6.II.B.5, 6.II.C.6, and 6.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- The performance tasks at the end of every module are neither formative nor summative assessments. They are not formative since they come at the end of the module, concluding students’ learning about the module topic and the literacy skills they have built over eight or nine weeks. However, they are also not summative because they are heavily scaffolded to help students create high-quality work and so are not a strong measure of what students can do independently. For these reasons, it is not recommended that performance tasks are analyzed with the same lens used to analyze assessments. Look at students’ performance tasks through the lens of the attributes of high-quality student work (authenticity, complexity, and craftsmanship).

- Students may be overwhelmed by the amount of work shown in the model presentation. Assure students that they will have plenty of time in class to work toward the final product, drafting and revising each step.

- Remind students that they are not being assessed on the quality or content of their contribution to the class anthology of focus figures. Rather, the End of Unit 3 Assessment requires students to trace and evaluate the arguments being made through the narrative nonfiction stories. Students practice these skills in Lessons 5 and 10, using the same note-catchers they will use during the assessment in Lessons 15–16.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue to draft and prepare their pages of the picture book, focusing specifically on how the illustrations add to the meaning of the text. Models and structured work time ensure students have the materials and time necessary to produce high-quality work.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Review the Performance Task Overview.

- Prepare the Characteristics of Narrative Nonfiction anchor chart, which will be co-created during Work Time A. Review the Characteristics of Narrative Nonfiction anchor chart (example for teacher reference).

- Gather several examples of narrative nonfiction picture books. Several options are listed on the Characteristics of Narrative Nonfiction anchor chart (example for teacher reference).

- Gather six copies or more of *Hidden Figures (Picture Book)*. Students do not need their own copy; rather, copies will be shared among several small groups. Preread *Hidden Figures (Picture Book)* to ensure a fluent reading.

- If time is a concern, excerpt the text instead of reading it in its entirety. Place sticky notes on pages that best highlight the features of narrative nonfiction students need to see modeled. Focus on these pages during Work Time A.

- Gather copies of the standard version of *Hidden Figures* as well to provide a side-by-side comparison of the adult, young adult, and picture book versions of the same story.

- Gather art supplies (blank paper, construction paper, colored pencils or markers, scissors) for students to begin constructing their books.

- Provide devices with word-processing capability for crews to type their texts.

- Determine the format in which the anthology of focus figure stories will be published. Crews could contribute to a physical book made from paper bound together into one larger book, or the class could compile their contributions to an ebook using an online tool, such as http://eled.org/0145.

- Preread the Model Performance Task: Wang Zhenyi to ensure a fluent reading.

- Review the student tasks and example answers to get familiar with what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Prepare copies of handouts for students, including entrance ticket (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.6.3 (10 minutes)

- Lay out **several examples of narrative nonfiction picture books** from the list on the **Characteristics of Narrative Nonfiction anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**. Invite students to choose two books to browse through. Explain that these books represent the narrative nonfiction genre. Tell students they will try to infer some general characteristics of this genre by looking at models.

- Distribute several **sticky notes** to each student. Explain that as they browse through the books, they should record their notices and wonderings about the genre of narrative nonfiction.

- Circulate and monitor as students browse, encouraging all responses. Push students to support their notices with examples from the texts (e.g., “Your sticky note says the books often include an author’s note. Can you show me where you saw that in the texts?”).

- Remind students that they are not reading both books cover to cover, simply scanning and browsing to get a sense of the books’ style, features, and tone. Ask students to hold on to their notes until later in the lesson.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as in previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons. Invite students to choose a habit of character focus for themselves for this lesson.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- If possible during Opening A, include examples of narrative nonfiction texts written in students’ home languages. This will help students who need heavier support to identify and name features of narrative nonfiction.

Work Time

A. Genre Study Narrative Nonfiction – W.6.3, SL.6.2 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify the characteristics of effective narrative nonfiction writing.”

- Ask students to retrieve the **Performance Task: Picture Book directions**, which they received in a previous lesson, and allow students time to review it silently. Remind students that they will be turning their research about their focus figure into a section of a children’s picture book to create an anthology, or collection, of stories.

- Explain that crews will be writing their section in narrative nonfiction style like the models they examined.

- Display a blank **Characteristics of Narrative Nonfiction anchor chart**. Using a total participation technique, gather student responses from their sticky notes to add to the anchor chart. Affirm correct inferences about the genre, and clarify misunderstandings. Refer to the **Characteristics of Narrative Nonfiction anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** for guidance. Note that there are a wide range of texts that fit this genre; the models won’t necessarily include all of the characteristics listed. Remind students that narrative nonfiction can be written for any age group; our focus is on picture books for primary school learners.

- Display and distribute **Text: *Hidden Figures (Picture Book)***. (Small groups of students can look at one of the class copies.) Explain that there are actually three versions of the *Hidden Figures* text—an adult, a young adult, and a picture book version written in narrative nonfiction style.

- Say:

“As I read the book aloud, think about which of the characteristics of narrative nonfiction you notice in this example.”

- Inform students that if they need to take notes as they listen to the text, they may document their thoughts on scrap paper, an index card, or a sticky note.

- Read aloud *Hidden Figures (Picture Book)*.

- At the end of the reading, ask:

“Which characteristics of narrative nonfiction did you see evidence of in this book?” (It included factual information but told the story using narrative techniques, like dialogue, description, and character development. It featured key historical individuals during a momentous historical time period. It included text features that emphasize the nonfiction aspects of the text, like a timeline. It was written with attention to the audience, adjusting the style and tone to appeal to primary school readers. The illustrations were engaging, detailed, and accurately depict the real people and settings being portrayed.)

- Ask:

“How does this book represent craftsmanship?” (The book was written at an appropriate level for its intended audience. The illustrations were detailed, aesthetically pleasing, and accurate representations of the text. The text included researched, factual information about the individuals of focus in the text.)

- Ask:

“How will what we write for the performance task differ from what we wrote for the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment?” (The assessment was an essay; it was written to be formal and academic. The picture book will be narrative and will have a different tone and text features, including illustrations.)

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time A, students examine the extent to which *Hidden Figures (Picture Book)* meets the characteristics of narrative nonfiction picture books. Consider repeating this questioning using other picture books from Opening A. Comparing multiple texts against the anchor chart will help students develop a more sophisticated understanding of what narrative nonfiction can look like.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time A, students examine the extent to which *Hidden Figures (Picture Book)* meets the characteristics of narrative nonfiction picture books. Consider slowing down this activity and offering ways for students to more deeply analyze the characteristics of the text. One way to do this would be to write the characteristics from the anchor chart on sentence strips and providing time for students to review the picture book multiple times, focusing on one characteristic at a time.

Work Time

B. Draft Narrative Nonfiction Picture Book Pages – W.6.3, W.6.5 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can draft a narrative nonfiction text about my focus figure’s remarkable accomplishments.”

- Invite students to join their three-person crews. Remind students that they are not each writing their own story, but they will work together to create one story together as a crew. Writing a book involves many people, such as the author, illustrator, editor, and publisher; encourage students to collaborate to share big ideas but also divvy up tasks as needed.

- Ask students to retrieve their Performance Task: Picture Book directions. Point out that students have already completed step 1 under Mission Objectives.

- Focus students on step 2: “Determine which accomplishments should be highlighted, keeping in mind that each crew will be responsible for three pages of content.”

- Explain that this should be their first objective as they begin the planning process today. Once students have chosen the accomplishments and details they want to include in their book, they should begin planning the text. Encourage students to think metacognitively about what kinds of planners might work best for their team (e.g., storyboard, graphic organizer, T-chart with text ideas on one side and illustration ideas on the other).

- Invite students to refer to the following materials as needed:

- **Performance Task anchor chart**

- **Independent Argument Evidence note-catcher**

- Characteristics of Narrative Nonfiction anchor chart

- Examples of narrative nonfiction picture books

- Text: *Hidden Figures (Picture Book)*

- Provide students with **art supplies** they may need to create their illustrations, such as blank paper, construction paper, colored pencils or markers, and scissors, and **devices**.

- Direct students to websites where they can access free, high-quality stock photos and clip art, such as http://eled.org/0147 or http://eled.org/0181.

- Release crews to begin working.

- As students work, circulate to answer questions, push their thinking, and provide support as needed. Remind them to review the model picture books and the anchor chart to help them make decisions and to also use one another as thought-partners. Guide students to include the most effective and relevant information to demonstrate why the focus figure’s accomplishments were so remarkable.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Closing and Assessment

A. Evaluate Model Performance Task: Wang Zhenyi – W.6.3, SL.6.2 (5 minutes)

- Display the **Model Performance Task: Wang Zhenyi**, and read it aloud.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“How does the model demonstrate the criteria for the performance task?” (The text is written in narrative nonfiction style. It includes three pages of information about the focus figure. The text is accompanied by thoughtfully crafted illustrations. The text incorporates a lot of factual information from the crew’s research.)

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Prepare Narrative Nonfiction and Illustrations

- Students continue to prepare the illustrations and text for their contribution to the children’s picture book about other hidden figures in space science.
