**Sample Proficient Response:** Scorepoint 3, for Teacher Reference:

When recalling America’s race to put an astronaut on the moon, history often overlooks Dorothy Vaughan. She, along with the other women of the segregated West Area Computing Unit, worked on projects that made airplanes faster and more stable, which helped the United States during World War II. Then she was promoted to supervisor of the West Computers. She led the women whose work would make space travel possible. As a brilliant mathematician and one of the first black women to work for NASA as a “computer,” Dorothy’s accomplishments deserve to be remembered. Her accomplishments were remarkable because they led to major advancements in air travel and because they took place despite tremendous obstacles.

Dorothy’s skills and hard work were very important in helping change the face of air travel. When Dorothy first started working at Langley, the laboratory was doing extensive research in aerodynamics. Langley was trying to help the United States military by developing airplanes that were stronger, faster, and more stable than any planes in other countries (52). Dorothy was inspired by this work. She took an engineering physics course, participated in training, and did much independent studying and homework (51). She thought all day about what made planes fly (51). Her calculations and data were sent directly to engineers, “who used them to improve airplane designs” (56). Dorothy’s mathematical brain and her commitment to learning were outstanding, and her work had a direct impact on the future of airplanes and aeronautics.

Dorothy achieved all this despite major obstacles, which makes her accomplishments even more remarkable. In the early 1940s, when Dorothy began her work at Langley, black women were horribly discriminated against. They were given fewer educational and professional opportunities. In 1940, only two percent of black women earned college degrees, and sixty percent of those graduates became teachers (41). Teaching was one of the few professions available to women of any color. The few women able to find math jobs outside of teaching were not considered “mathematicians.” Instead they were labeled “sub-professionals” and were paid less than men who did the same work (13). At this time in history, “it was unthinkable for a man to report to a woman” (74). Black women like Dorothy were not even allowed to eat in the same cafeteria as the white women with the same job (42). Nonetheless, in 1949, Dorothy was promoted to supervisor of the West Area computing pool. She was the first black woman to ever have a supervisor role at the laboratory (74). To get a leadership position at a time of such discrimination against black women is a remarkable accomplishment, and Dorothy was a remarkable woman.

W.6.1a: The second reason and its evidence is organized clearly.

W.6.1b: Claims are supported with clear reasons and relevant evidence from the text.

W.6.1c, L.6.6: Words, phrases, and clauses are consistently used to clarify the relationships among claim(s) and reasons.

W.6.1e: Concluding statement follows from the argument presented.

RI.6.1, W.6.9: A clear understanding of the text is demonstrated by developing a valid claim supported by logical reasons and evidence from the text.

As an employee of NASA and a member of the West Area Computers, Dorothy was part of an exclusive group of black women who were pioneers in space science. Dorothy’s work led to major advancements in a new, exciting field. Her scientific and mathematical accomplishments are truly remarkable. The fact that she was able to accomplish such things despite such cruelty and discrimination against her makes her accomplishments even more worthy of admiration. The history of NACA and space science is incomplete without acknowledgment of Dorothy Vaughan’s remarkable accomplishments.
