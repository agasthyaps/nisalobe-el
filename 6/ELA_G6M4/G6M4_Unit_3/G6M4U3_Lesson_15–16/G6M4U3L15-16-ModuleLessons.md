Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Work Time A: Students complete Part I of the End of Unit 3 Assessment. In Part I, student crews present the picture book pages that they produced for their performance task about the focus figures they researched. Students show the picture book pages, highlight the figure’s most important achievements, and convey their argument about why this person’s accomplishments are remarkable. Members of the audience provide feedback on their classmates’ presentations and delineating their argument, claims, reasoning, and evidence. (SL.6.3, SL.6.4, SL.6.5, SL.6.6, L.6.6)

- In Opening A, students’ Mid-Unit 3 Assessments are returned with feedback. This allows students the opportunity to see how they performed in order to improve in their next assessment and to ask questions if they don’t understand the feedback.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Create an air of celebration around the performance task presentations. Invite outside audience members, such as administrators, parents, or other students for either this lesson or the next.

- One aim of this performance task is to help students make heard and known the stories of women in space science whose contributions have gone unsung. To heighten the impact of students’ work and broaden the audience who will benefit from the students’ work, make the books available as a resource for other students (e.g., by providing copies of the books in the school library or sharing them with a local historical organization).

- Students who excel at graphic design could be tasked with creating promotional materials for the presentations, such as fliers, posters, and programs. Allow students to experiment with a free online design tool, such as http://eled.org/0254, to create these materials.

- Students could discuss or compose a written reflection on the similarities and/or differences among the presentations they viewed and the contributions by the focus figures featured in those presentations.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Students have practiced presenting and delineating arguments in Lessons 5 and 10 of this unit. They have also created and rehearsed with their crewmates their presentation for today’s lesson.

Support All Students

- Students may need additional support reading aloud their presentations and showing visuals. Support students with their presentations as needed.

- Students who are unable to present to a larger audience could video record their presentation, and this could be played to the audience instead of being presented live.

- ELLs may find the assessment challenging, despite the days spent preparing and practicing their presentations. Allow students to practice their presentations one last time before visitors arrive. ▲

- To support ELLs, these lessons invite students to complete assessment tasks that draw from past learning in the unit. After multiple lessons devoted to preparation and rehearsal, students deliver presentations of their picture book pages, making an argument as to why their focus figure’s accomplishments are remarkable. The listeners delineate the arguments they hear, using a note-catcher that is identical to the note-catchers of early lessons that centered on similar tasks. The familiarity of the tasks involved in the end of unit assessment sets ELLs up for success.

- ELLs may find it challenging to independently complete the end of unit assessment without scaffolding. Nurture students’ confidence by pointing out that this assessment is very similar to the activities students have successfully completed in class across multiple lessons. Encourage students to do their best, and assure them that they will continue learning together after the assessment.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.4, 6.I.B.5, 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.7, 6.I.B.8, 6.I.C.9, 6.I.C.12, 6.II.A.1, and 6.II.A.2.

Assessment Guidance

- The End of Unit 3 Assessment is included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback to students on this assessment, use the provided Assessment checklist for each student. Prioritize listening in on students with less data regarding their speaking and listening skills.

- Display a schedule that identifies when students are presenting and when students are assessing others’ presentations and delineating others’ arguments. This preparation will promote a balance of peer viewers and presenters. See the In Advance section for important additional information.

- Utilize a timer to keep presentations on track.

- Encourage students to give one another a word of congratulations or a nonverbal cue of congratulations after viewing one another’s presentations.

- If possible, video record students’ presentations, and watch the videos with students afterward to evaluate their volume, eye contact, intonation, and clarity of responses to the presentation prompts.

- Though the performance tasks are the content students will work with, the End of Unit 3 Assessment is focused on their presentation, listening, and argument delineation skills. The quality of their performance task should not impact the End of Unit 3 Assessment scores.

- The performance tasks at the end of every module are neither formative nor summative assessments. They are not formative since they come at the end of the module, concluding students’ learning about the module topic and the literacy skills they have built over eight or nine weeks. However, they are also not summative because they are heavily scaffolded to help students create high-quality work, and so are not a strong measure of what students can do independently. For these reasons, we do not recommend analyzing performance tasks with the same lens used to analyze assessments. Look at students’ performance tasks through the lens of the attributes of high-quality student work (authenticity, complexity, and craftsmanship).

Down the Road

- The next lesson is the final lesson of this module. Students participate in a collaborative discussion to bring the module and the year to a close. Students may also share their children’s book pages with a wider audience, depending on the opportunities available at the specific school site.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare the End of Unit 3 Assessment (see Assessment Overview and Resources).

- The assessment can be arranged in different ways, depending on the schedule, location, and number of teachers available to complete the Assessment checklist. It is recommended that each crew presents to the entire class, allowing the teacher to fill in the first part of the Assessment checklist, focusing on just one crew at a time. Presentations could also be recorded and revisited to fill in the Assessment checklist later.

- Students will be assessed both on their presentation and their ability to delineate an argument. Decide which students will delineate which crew’s presentations. Each student only needs to complete one, but two note-catchers have been provided in case students would benefit from two attempts at delineating. List the order of presentations, and have students delineate the argument of whichever crew is presenting just before them.

- Decide if students will also complete the optional peer assessment and for how many of their peers. This is provided as an option if students would benefit from having an additional task while listening to ensure accountability while also providing their peers with feedback on their presentation skills. If the peer assessment is being used, it is not recommended that students delineate and peer-assess at the same time; divide the tasks so a student is only doing one at a time for a presentation.

- Create and post the presentation order and the listener responsibilities based on the decisions above.

- Review the student tasks and example answers to get familiar with what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Prepare copies of handouts for students, including entrance ticket (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time A: Use a recording device to capture all students presenting. Recordings can then be accessed later by the students for self-assessment and reflection and/or for summative assessment after the lesson ends.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.6.10 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as in previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lessons 15–16**. Students will also need **their Mid-Unit 3 Assessment with feedback**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as in previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

Work Time

A. End of Unit 3 Assessment Part I: Present and Delineate Argument: Picture Book Presentation (80 minutes)

- Review the learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can present my crew’s children’s book pages and argument about why my focus figure’s accomplishments were remarkable.”

“I can delineate my peers’ arguments about why their focus figure’s accomplishments were remarkable.”

- Focus students on the **Performance Task anchor chart**, and remind them of where this work has all been leading. Explain that, in this lesson, they will present to a live audience.

- Focus students on the **Presentation checklist**. Invite students to Turn and Talk to an elbow partner and share one criterion they want to focus on during their presentation today, and why.

- Invite students to meet with their crew and take out their **Performance Task: Children’s Picture Book directions** and **Performance Task Picture Books**.

- Distribute the **End of Unit 3 Assessment Part I: Present and Delineate Argument: Picture Book Presentation**. Review the directions. Remind students they completed similar tasks with their collaborative essays in Lesson 5 and the independent essays in Lesson 10. Clarify any questions students may have.

- Post the argument delineation assignments so students know for whom they will complete this task. If applicable, distribute the optional **Peer Assessment: Picture Book Presentation** handouts and post the peer presentation assignments.

- Explain the procedures and expectations both when the students are presenters and when they are audience members. Remind students to check the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart** before they listen to their peers’ presentations, focusing on the characteristics of respect and empathy.

- Begin the presentations. Use the **End of Unit 3 Assessment Part I: Present and Delineate Argument: Picture Book Presentation Assessment checklist (for teacher reference)** to assess the presenters argument presentation and speaking skills and to assess the listeners’ argument delineation skills.

- After the allotted time for presentations has expired, invite audience members to join in a show of appreciation for all presenters. Invite students to join in a gesture of appreciation for all the audience members.

For Lighter Support

- After reading the directions for Part I of the end of unit assessment, invite students who need lighter support to repeat in their own words what the expectations are for the assessment (i.e., who does what and when).

For Heavier Support

- After reading the directions for Part I of the end of unit assessment, invite students who need heavier support to produce some sort of visual, like a sketch or diagram, that shows the expectations for the assessment (i.e., who does what and when).

Closing and Assessment

A. Reflection – SL.6.4 (5 minutes)

- Refocus whole group. Focus students on the Presentation checklist. Invite students to Turn and Talk to an elbow partner and share if they were successful at the one criterion they wanted to focus on during their presentation today. Remind students to report at least one piece of evidence that supports their success.

- Give students specific, positive feedback on their presentations (e.g., “I heard a lot of you speaking at an appropriate pace and volume to be clearly understood”).
