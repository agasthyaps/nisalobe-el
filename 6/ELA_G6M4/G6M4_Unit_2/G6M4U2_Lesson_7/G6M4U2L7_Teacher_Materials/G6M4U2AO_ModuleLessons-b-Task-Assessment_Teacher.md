**Part B**

Provide two pieces of evidence from the excerpt along with reasoning to support the claim selected in Part A. (RI.6.1, RI.6.3, W.6.1b, W.6.10)

**Evidence 1:**

“When the laboratory operated on a twenty-four-hour schedule during the war, Dorothy had worked the 3:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. shift, taking care of her family by day and crunching numbers at night” (66).

**Reasoning:**

This piece of evidence shows that Vaughan was willing to do whatever was necessary to be successful. She both cared about and took care of her family, and she also did a great job at work. She sacrificed her own needs and worked hard. As a result, everyone around her at home or work got what they needed.

**Evidence 2:**

“Dorothy loved staying home to take care of the new babies, but there was never a question that she would return to work as soon as possible after the children were old enough to stay with a babysitter” (65).

**Reasoning:**

This piece of evidence shows that Vaughan made sure that her children had good care, even when she was working. The decisions she made gave her the ability not only to advance her career, but also allowed her to continue to grow her family and provide a bright future for them and herself.

**Evidence 1:**

“This was the first time an African-American woman had been assigned a management role at Langley” (74).

**Reasoning:**

**Evidence 2:**

“Many of the women in West Computing knew she was the best candidate, and so did many engineers. In time her bosses realized it, too” (75).
