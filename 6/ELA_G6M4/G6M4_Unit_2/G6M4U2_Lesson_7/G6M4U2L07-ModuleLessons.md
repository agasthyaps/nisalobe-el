Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Work Time A: Students complete the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment. The Module 4, Mid-Unit 2 Assessment is a reading assessment. Students will read two short sections of chapter 9 in their anchor text, *Hidden Figures*, and answer selected response and short answer questions about the argument the author makes in the text, as well as the author’s point of view toward Dorothy. (RI.6.1, RI.6.3, RI.6.6, RI.6.8, W.6.1b, W.6.10)

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners by reading and answering questions independently for the mid-unit assessment. Prompt students’ perseverance by reminding them that assessments are meant to inform instruction. Use assessment data to make choices about what should be retaught and how to adjust the pacing. Encourage students not to be afraid of making mistakes; an accurate assessment is crucial for tailoring lessons to students’ needs.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Some students may not need extensive review of the assessment directions. Release them to begin working on the assessment while clarification is provided to other students who need more support.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the first half of this unit, students read several chapters of *Hidden Figures*, focusing on the life and achievements of Dorothy Vaughan. They analyzed the author’s point of view and traced the author’s claims. This lesson continues those routines in an assessment, asking students to apply their learning to a new chapter of *Hidden Figures*.

Support All Students

- As with any assessment, students may feel nervous to read new passages independently and answer questions about them. Point out all the preparation they have had through activities, homework, and in-class reading time. Also, remind them there will be other opportunities throughout Module 4 to demonstrate what they have learned.

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment.

- For some students, this assessment may require more than the 35 minutes allotted. Provide time over multiple days if necessary.

- An opportunity to track their progress after the assessment helps students reflect on and celebrate their growth.

- To support ELLs, this lesson invites students to complete assessment tasks similar to the classroom tasks in Lessons 1–6. In this assessment, students read short excerpts from the anchor text and answer selected response questions to identify claims about Dorothy Vaughan that can be supported by information in the excerpt. They also locate evidence within the excerpt to support the claims they choose. Finally, students answer selected response questions about the author’s point of view toward Dorothy.

- ELLs may find it challenging to independently complete the mid-unit assessment without scaffolding. Point out that the excerpts students read during the assessment are from the anchor text and about a familiar figure, Dorothy Vaughan. It may assuage students’ concerns to know that they are already acquainted with the writing style, organization, and content of the assessment passages. Encourage students to do their best on the assessment, and assure them that they will continue learning together throughout the remainder of the unit.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.7, 6.I.C.11, and 6.II.A.1.

Assessment Guidance

- All assessment materials for Mid-Unit 2 Assessment: Analyze Dorothy Vaughan: *Hidden Figures*, Chapter 9 (student and teacher versions) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback on this assessment, use the answer key and sample student responses (see Assessment Overview and Resources) to help complete students’ Track Progress recording form.

- Using information from this assessment, students are tracking progress toward anchor standards:

- R.1: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.

- R.10: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Read and comprehend complex literary and informational texts independently and proficiently.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students compare and contrast two authors’ presentations of the same event.

- Students’ Mid-Unit 2 Assessments will be returned in Unit 2, Lesson 16 with feedback.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.6.10 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as in previous lessons to distribute and review the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 7**. Students will also need their **Module 4 End of Unit 1 Assessment with feedback**. Once all students are ready, invite them to share their stars and steps with a partner. Remind students that everyone is working toward individual goals and that learning is about continued growth and development.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as in previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons. Invite students to choose a habit of character focus for themselves for this lesson.

Work Time

A. Mid-Unit 2 Assessment: Analyze Dorothy Vaughan: *Hidden Figures*, Chapter 9 (35 minutes)

- Review the learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze the claim, evidence, and reasoning in an excerpt of *Hidden Figures*.”

“I can analyze the author’s point of view toward Dorothy Vaughan and how it’s conveyed in the text.”

- Distribute **Mid-Unit 2 Assessment: Analyze Dorothy Vaughan: *Hidden Figures***, **Chapter 9**.

- Tell students that for this assessment, they will read two short sections of a new chapter of the anchor text, *Hidden Figures*. Students will identify the author’s claims about Dorothy, develop evidence and reasoning to support those claims, and determine the author’s point of view toward Dorothy.

- Read the directions for each part of the assessment aloud as students follow along, reading silently. Ensure students understand the directions; paraphrase some instructions, if needed. ▲ Answer students’ questions, but refrain from supplying answers to the assessment questions themselves.

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence. Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**, and review what perseverance looks and sounds like. Remind students that because they will be reading and answering questions independently for the assessment, they may need to practice perseverance.

- Invite students to begin the assessment.

- While they are taking the assessment, circulate to monitor and document their test-taking skills. After the assessment is complete, distribute **Synopsis: *Hidden Figures***, **Chapter 9**.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- Display a “map” of the assessment to reference while explaining directions to the mid-unit assessment. This will reduce ambiguity and give students a clearer picture of what they can expect so that they can better allocate their time and attentional resources. An example is given below:

- Read a short excerpt from chapter 9 of *Hidden Figures*. Then,

- Choose a claim that is supported by the excerpt.

- Provide two pieces of evidence that support that claim.

- Read another short excerpt from chapter 9 of *Hidden Figures*. Then,

- Choose a claim that is supported by the excerpt.

- Provide two pieces of evidence that support that claim.

- Choose a statement that best describes the author’s point of view in the two excerpts. Then,

- Provide two pieces of evidence that support your answer.

Closing and Assessment

A. Track Progress – RI.6.10 (5 minutes)

- Give students specific, positive feedback on their completion of the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment. Provide students with Synopsis: *Hidden Figures*, Chapter 9 if students need clarification on the chapter they read for the assessment.

- Distribute **Track Progress folders**; **Track Progress: Read, Understand, and Explain New Text**; and **sticky notes**.

- Tell students the sticky notes are for them to find evidence of the following criterion:

- RI.6.1

- Guide students through completing the form. The row for RI.6.4, L.6.4 will not apply to this assessment and should be left blank. Encourage students to orally paraphrase the meaning of the Track Progress criteria, self-assess, and discuss the evidence with a partner before they begin writing.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their habit of character focus for this lesson.

Homework

A. Preread Anchor Text

- Students finish reading chapter 9 in *Hidden Figures* in preparation for studying the chapter in the next lesson.
