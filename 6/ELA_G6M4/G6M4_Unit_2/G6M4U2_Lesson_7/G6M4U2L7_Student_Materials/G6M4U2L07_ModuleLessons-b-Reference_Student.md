Synopsis: *Hidden Figures*, Chapter 9

**Name:** **Date:**

- Dorothy and Howard Vaughan had two more children. Dorothy stayed at home to take care of the new babies, but she was determined to go back to work at Langley because her job provided financial stability for the family.

- Even though Dorothy and her children missed their family in Farmville, the West Computing Pool served as a family for Dorothy and her children. The West Computing Pool families began a tradition of having a picnic at Log Cabin Beach, which was a beach specifically for black people.

- During the war, Langley Lab was open twenty-four hours a day. Dorothy was able to take care of her family during the day and work at night from 3 p.m. to 11 p.m.

- Dorothy made a good salary but she also had six kids, so Dorothy was very responsible with her money and she made sacrifices to ensure that her children were taken care of.

- The Hampton Roads economy did not collapse after World War II. Quite the contrary, the area became a military capital; however, Langley employment dropped significantly after the war.

- Many women working at Langley decided to return home to take care of their families. Other women married men with whom they had worked. Some women figured out the balance of working and taking care of their families.

- The airplane continued its importance to the US economy, so Langley still needed talented computers.

- Langley closed the East Computing pool in 1947 and reassigned the women to work in wind tunnels. The West Computing pool remained intact and began to receive the assignments from the East Computing pool. Work was plentiful for the West Computers.

- Dorothy was promoted to shift supervisor and managed a group of computers.

- Computers rarely received recognition for their contributions to a successful project.

- Langley had the hope of crafting an airplane that would fly faster than the speed of sound. A team of thirteen people was sent into the Mojave desert to establish a high-speed flight research center.

- Chuck Yeager flew the experimental plane, the Bell X-1, on October 14, 1947, and reached Mach 1.

- Everyone received credit for the achievement. The former East Computers who were a part of the team in the Mojave Desert gained the titles of junior engineer and had their names published on reports for the project.

- Dorothy became the temporary head of the entire West Computing pool. Dorothy’s bosses were hesitant to permanently place Dorothy in the position because an African American woman had never been assigned a management position at Langley.

- January 1951, Dorothy Vaughan’s permanent position as the head of the West Area Computers unit was officially announced.
