<p>In 1943, Americans thought constantly about what they could do to help with the war effort. At the time, Dorothy Vaughan was teaching at R.R. Moton High School. She added a new unit to her curriculum called Wartime Mathematics. She centered her lessons around practical knowledge to help students learn to manage finances. She instructed students on how to follow a budget and use ration books (27).</p>

<p>In 1943, NACA began recruiting African American women as mathematicians. Vaughan felt conflicted about applying for this job. She was a wife and a mother. Taking the job meant moving away from her family and working long hours. But Dorothy knew this was a particularly good job and that her increased salary would make life better for her children. In November 1943, Dorothy Vaughan accepted a position with NACA as a mathematician (14, 28).</p>

<p>Vaughan believed in the idea of the “Double V,” or double victory. She, along with many African Americans, believed in fighting for freedom of the oppressed in World War II. They also believed in fighting for their own civil rights as citizens of the United States. Vaughan believed that her work at NACA could contribute to both causes. She could help with the calculations that would make airplanes faster, safer, and more powerful, while also demonstrating that race and gender had nothing to do with her intelligence (35–36).</p>

<p>Vaughan and her colleagues in the West Computing pool knew that their race and gender meant that their work was more likely to be criticized. They knew that they “needed to be twice as good to get half as far as their white counterparts.” So they formed close bonds, double-checking each other’s work and holding each other to high standards in regards to their appearance and behavior. They knew that if they worked together, they could challenge the negative stereotypes they faced for being black and female (46).</p>
