Chalk Talk Directions: Dorothy Vaughan

- At each piece of chart paper:

- Read the excerpt from *Hidden Figures* posted on the chart paper.

- On your sticky note, respond to the focus question posted on the chart.

- Place the sticky note on the chart paper.

- Wait for the signal to move to the next station.

- Move quietly and carefully.

- At the next piece of chart paper, read the excerpt, the focus question, and all other student responses on sticky notes. Consider the other student responses as you add your own. Build on a peer’s response, respectfully challenge an idea presented, or add an original response.

- Continue until you have traveled to each piece of chart paper.
