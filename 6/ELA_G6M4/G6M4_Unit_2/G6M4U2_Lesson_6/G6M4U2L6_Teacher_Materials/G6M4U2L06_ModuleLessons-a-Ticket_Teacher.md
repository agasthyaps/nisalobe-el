RI.6.1, RI.6.8, W.6.1b, W.6.10

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, read the learning targets. Then, read an excerpt from chapter 5 of *Hidden Figures*, starting on page 30 (the beginning of the chapter) and ending on page 31  
(“. . . subdivision known as Newsome Park“). Then, answer the following questions.

1.  Which sentence best represents a claim that could be supported from this excerpt? (RI.6.8)

2.  <u>The impact of World War II was felt in the Hampton Roads community and resulted in many positive changes in the area.</u>

3.  The women in the Hampton Roads community had few opportunities for employment due to the war efforts in the area.

4.  The government of Hampton Roads did nothing to address the changing needs of the people in its community.

5.  Landlords took advantage of the African American population in Hampton Roads by charging high rents for poor housing.

6.  Provide one piece of evidence from the excerpt along with reasoning to support the claim. (RI.6.1, W.6.1b, W.6.10)

Evidence: Responses will vary, but may include:

“With men off to fight on the front lines, womanpower picked up the slack” (31).

“The government addressed the shortage by building 5,200 new homes in the East End of Newport News” (31).

Reasoning:

This piece of evidence shows that one of the positive changes of the war was the women had more opportunities for employment and were allowed more freedom to do jobs and tasks they weren’t previously. This piece of evidence shows that another of the positive changes of the war was increased population in the communities surrounding Langley. This population growth was supported by the government, which ensured the employees had adequate and quality housing that enabled them to move their families to the area. Another result of this development was that it built communities of which the Langley employees could feel a part.
