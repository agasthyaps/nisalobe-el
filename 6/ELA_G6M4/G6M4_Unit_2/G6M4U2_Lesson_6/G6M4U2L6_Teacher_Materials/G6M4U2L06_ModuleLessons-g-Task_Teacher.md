Chalk Talk Text Chunks: Dorothy Vaughan

(Example for Teacher Reference)

1.  After attending Wilberforce University, one of her professors recommended that she attend graduate school at Howard University for more education. However, the country was in a depression. Dorothy’s parents were struggling financially. Dorothy turned down graduate school and took a job as a teacher instead. The money she earned went to help her family.

Focus Question: Which habit of character does Vaughan display through her choices in this part of the text? Briefly explain your choice.

Responses will vary, but may include: Choosing to help her family shows compassion. Even though Vaughan intended to go to graduate school, she saw a greater need within her family and came up with a solution—becoming a teacher. She showed compassion by putting her family’s needs above her own desires.

2.  In 1943, Americans thought constantly about what they could do to help with the war effort. At the time, Dorothy Vaughan was teaching at R.R. Moton High School. She added a new unit to her curriculum called Wartime Mathematics. She centered her lessons around practical knowledge to help students learn to manage finances. She instructed students on how to follow a budget and use ration books (27).

Focus Question: Which habit of character does Vaughan display through her choices in this part of the text? Briefly explain your choice.

Responses will vary, but may include: Vaughan applied her learning to help her school community. She connected the math skills she was required to teach to the practical knowledge students would need to survive during wartime.

3.  In 1943, NACA began recruiting African American women as mathematicians. Vaughan felt conflicted about applying for this job. She was a wife and a mother. Taking the job meant moving away from her family and working long hours. But Dorothy knew this was a particularly good job and that her increased salary would make life better for her children. In November 1943, Dorothy Vaughan accepted a position with NACA as a mathematician (14, 28).

Responses will vary, but may include: By applying for and accepting the position at NACA, Dorothy was taking initiative. She saw what needed to be done, and she took the lead on making a responsible decision.

4.  Vaughan believed in the idea of the “Double V,” or double victory. She, along with many African Americans, believed in fighting for freedom of the oppressed in World War II. They also believed in fighting for their own civil rights as citizens of the United States. Vaughan believed that her work at NACA could contribute to both causes. She could help with the calculations that would make airplanes faster, safer, and more powerful, while also demonstrating that race and gender had nothing to do with her intelligence (35–36).

Focus Question: Which habit of character does Vaughan display through her choices in this part of the text? Briefly explain your choice.

Responses will vary, but may include: Vaughan was determined to use her strengths to help others grow. She was a talented mathematician, which could help the war effort, specifically the production of aircraft. But she could also use her strengths as a confident, black woman to be a pioneer and a role model for other women of color to break into segregated organizations.

5.  Vaughan and her colleagues in the West Computing pool knew that their race and gender meant that their work was more likely to be criticized. They knew that they “needed to be twice as good to get half as far as their white counterparts.” So they formed close bonds, double-checking each other’s work and holding each other to high standards in regards to their appearance and behavior. They knew that if they worked together, they could challenge the negative stereotypes they faced for being black and female (46).

Responses will vary, but may include: By banding together with her colleagues, Vaughan demonstrated collaboration. The West Computers worked well together to accomplish their goals. Together they worked toward professional goals (completing accurate calculations) as well as personal goals (breaking down racial and gender biases).
