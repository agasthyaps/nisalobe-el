Synopsis: *Hidden Figures*, Prologue and Chapter 1

**Name:** **Date:**

**Prologue**

- The author, who is also the narrator, grew up in Hampton, Virginia.

- The community was full of African American mathematicians, scientists, and engineers.

- The narrator attended NASA family gatherings, such as the NASA carnival and NASA holiday party.

- The narrator did not realize until she was much older how extraordinary it was that African American women were working at NASA.

**Chapter 1**

- Dorothy Vaughan, Mary Jackson, Katherine Johnson, and Christine Darden were exceptional at math, and they all studied mathematics in college.

- These women worked as teachers then worked at NACA as “computers” (mathematicians).

- Vaughan, Jackson, Johnson, and Darden stood out because of their talents and hard work.

- 1943 was the first year NACA began hiring African American women as computers. Dorothy Vaughan began working at NACA in 1943. She was also the first African American woman to move into a managerial position. Dorothy helped other computers further their careers as well.

- Mary Jackson was the first African American woman at NACA to become an engineer. Her work aided in the progress of supersonic aircraft.

- Katherine Johnson’s calculations helped send the first men into space and bring them back to Earth safely.

- Christine Darden produced groundbreaking research on the prediction of sonic booms.

- The accomplishments of these women happened during a time in US history when racial discrimination was a part of daily life in the South.

- Even though the government ended slavery, granted full citizenship, and gave voting rights to African Americans after the Civil War, many state governments passed laws that kept black people and white people separated. These laws were most common in the South.

- During the Great Depression of the 1930s, African Americans struggled to find work, so World War II was an opportunity to secure jobs and provide for their families.

- World War II opened the door for men and women to join the armed forces. The war also created jobs at NACA, which presented the chance for Vaughan, Jackson, Johnson, and Darden to become professional mathematicians.
