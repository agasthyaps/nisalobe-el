What were the accomplishments of the “hidden figures” at NACA, and why were they remarkable?

- *The West End Computers at NACA, or the hidden figures, impacted scientific progress by using their exceptional talents in math and science to advance key projects in space science.*

- *The hidden figures impacted social progress by being the first black women to assume positions at NACA, which, like many institutions of the time, had long enforced discriminatory hiring policies.*

- *The hidden figures used their personal strength and professional talents to help themselves, their families, their communities, NACA, and the United States, thus contributing to a better world.*

What will your student be doing at school?

In Unit 1, students built background knowledge about the historical context of the Space Race and the Apollo missions featured in the anchor text, *Hidden Figures* (Young Readers’ Edition). As students segue into Unit 2, they begin to recognize that many others contributed to the success of the lunar landing beyond those most commonly recognized in history. This is made clear by reading selections from the anchor text. This nonfiction text tells the story of Dorothy Vaughan, Mary Jackson, and Katherine Johnson, just a few of the first African American women to be hired as computers, or mathematicians, at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, which later evolved into NASA. Through their stories, students understand that the contributions of these women and the other West Computers to math and science were extraordinary in their own right, but made even more laudable when considering the racial and gender discrimination they faced at the time. Vaughan, Jackson, and Johnson leveraged their intelligence and courage to pioneer a path for the US space research program and other women interested in this field. Students will be assessed on their ability to read a new chapter in their anchor text and answer questions about the argument the author makes in the text, as well as the author’s point of view toward Dorothy.

Paired with several supplemental texts, students examine the same event from multiple perspectives and reflect on the different ways that an author might choose to convey that event. Students also examine different arguments presented through the texts and evaluate the evidence and reasoning provided by the authors. A second assessment will measure their ability to compare and contrast two texts that describe similar events in Katherine Johnson’s life, focusing on similarities and differences in the content conveyed, the authors’ methods used to convey that content, and points of view. These skills are key to helping students become critical consumers of information, to closely and attentively read in a way that helps them understand and evaluate complex works. Students also compose their own arguments about why the accomplishments of the hidden figures were remarkable. Students must support these arguments with credible evidence and sound reasoning. Their written responses will help them to answer one of the module’s guiding questions: What were the accomplishments of the “hidden figures” at NACA, and why were they remarkable?

Central to the EL Education curriculum is a focus on “habits of character” and social-emotional learning. Students work to become effective learners, developing mindsets and skills for success in college, career, and life (e.g., initiative, responsibility, perseverance, collaboration); work to become ethical people, treating others well and standing up for what is right (e.g., empathy, integrity, respect, compassion); and work to contribute to a better world, putting their learning to use to improve communities (e.g., citizenship, service).

In this unit, students work to become effective learners by collaborating with a small group of students in an activity called a jigsaw, for which each member becomes an expert on one small piece of a larger topic and shares their learning with the group. Students work to become ethical people by showing empathy and compassion toward one another while reading the anchor text, which, at times, presents sensitive topics that may affect each person differently. Students have concrete examples of what it looks like to contribute to a better world in *Hidden Figures*. Vaughan, Jackson, and Johnson used their strengths to support people around them as well as to support their community.

How can you support your student at home?

Read news articles with your student. Ask your student to determine the central idea of the articles. Also ask your student to identify evidence in the articles that contribute to the central idea.

Read articles of current global events with your student. Try to read articles that present the same event. Talk to your student about the point of view of each article. How are the points of view of the authors different from each other? How does the author’s point of view change how the event is conveyed?

Gently pose questions to your student about his/her stance on different issues. Ask how they know what they know, where they found their evidence, how they know that evidence is sound and credible, and what other perspectives someone else might have about that same issue. Model this process by examining aloud your own stance on a particular issue.

Show your student a video of a really important event in your life. Talk to your student about how he/she thinks it felt to be a part of that important event. If possible, talk to someone who was alive at the time of the Space Race. Ask that person to share their experience of watching the Apollo 11 lunar landing.

Discuss your student’s talents. Ask your student how his/her talents can be used to positively contribute to the world around him/her, like the women in *Hidden Figures*.

Talk to your student about historical figures often studied. Participate in a family research project that uncovers people “behind the scenes” who supported that historical figure and helped the figure be successful.

Watch the *Hidden Figures* (2016) film together. Ask your student to share which scenes of the book are depicted in the film and which are new.

Point out “hidden figures” in your daily life. Who are the people in your home/neighborhood/local government/place of worship who contribute greatly to the community but receive little recognition? Think of ways to show appreciation for these individuals.

Unit 2: Homework

The focus of homework in this unit is prereading the anchor text and completing independent research reading.

**Research reading:** Your student is expected to independently research the topic of study in this module, Remarkable Accomplishments in Space Science, by reading topic-related books of his or her choice. Research reading will be assigned on evenings when students are not already reading the anchor text. Students will be expected to read for approximately 20 minutes each day and respond to a prompt of choice in the front of the independent reading journal.

**Choice reading:** If your student would also like to independently read and respond to a book of free choice, he or she may use the back of the independent reading journal.

Independent Reading

**Directions:** Remember to record responses to research reading in the front of your independent reading journal and responses to choice reading in the back. Try to choose a different prompt each time.

Record any new vocabulary in your vocabulary log. Underline vocabulary found during independent reading.

**Record:**

- Date

- Title and author of your reading book

- Pages you have read

- Prompt

- Response

**Example:**

<u>Date</u>: 05/20/2019

<u>Book Title and Author</u>: *Hidden Figures* (Young Readers’ Edition) by Margot Lee Shetterly

<u>Pages Read</u>: 153–158

<u>Prompt</u>: Which habits of character are demonstrated in the text? Explain.

<u>Response</u>: Mary Jackson used her strengths to help her son build a car for the soap box derby. Being an engineer and having extensive knowledge of aerodynamics, Mary was able to use her expertise to guide her son. Mary and Levi worked tirelessly to figure out the best design for the soap box car. They made sketches, took measurements, tested different designs, and searched their garage for materials to use to build the car. Mary and Levi used the habit of collaboration to build the best car.

**  
Consider using the following independent reading prompts.**[^1]

- How does this text add to your understanding of one of the guiding questions of the module?

- Which habits of character are demonstrated in the text? Explain.

- Which habits of character are NOT demonstrated in the text? Explain.

- Record two or three facts in your own words that you learned from the text.

- Summarize your research reading today in no more than five sentences.

- Explain a way in which you connect to the text.

- Explain how the text connects to another text you’ve read.

- Explain how the text connects to something currently happening in the world.

- Explain how the text connects to *Hidden Figures* (Young Readers’ Edition).

- Explain how the text relates to the topic of Remarkable Accomplishments in Space Science.

- Explain how excerpts from the text represent accurate historical context.

- Choose one new word from your reading today, and analyze it on a vocabulary square.

| **Definition in your own words**                  | **Synonyms** (words with the same meaning) |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Words with the same affix or root**             | **Sketch**                                 |
| **Translation in home language** (if appropriate) |                                            |

**Vocabulary**

**Directions:** In the classroom, you have been recording words from your texts in your vocabulary log. Throughout this unit, you have been research reading topic-related books at home to build your knowledge of the Space Race and recording words in your independent reading journal.

Choose a word from your research reading or from a text you’ve read in class, and add the word to your vocabulary log. Try to choose a different word to add and to practice a different vocabulary strategy each time. For each word, be sure to add the following:

1.  The definition, or meaning, of the word

<!-- -->

2.  The vocabulary strategy you used to figure out the meaning of the word

3.  A sketch or diagram that helps you to better understand the meaning of the word

Record new vocabulary in vocabulary logs and mark academic vocabulary with a symbol, for example a star:

- Academic vocabulary: words you might find in informational texts on many different topics. For example, the words **evidence** and **rationale** are words that could be found in books on any topic.

- Domain-specific vocabulary: words about a particular topic. For example, the words **ballistic missile**, **trajectory**, and **lunar** are some that would be found on the topic of space science.

**Vocabulary Strategies**

As a reminder, the vocabulary strategies we have been working on in class are listed below:

- Context: read the sentence around the word.

- Look at the affixes for clues.

- Look at the root of the word for clues.

- Use a dictionary.

- Discuss the word with another person (after attempting some of the above strategies).

[^1]: Some of the prompts will not be appropriate for the text students are reading. Invite students to choose a prompt that works for the text they have just read.
