**Sentence**

The contributions made by these African American women have never been heralded, but they deserve to be remembered**—and not as a side note in someone else’s account, but as the center of their own story.** (from pages 2–3 in *Hidden Figures* \[Young Readers’ Edition\] by Margot Lee Shetterly)

The contributions made by these African American women

Deconstruct

- **these African American women**

“Who is Margot Lee Shetterly referring to in this chunk?” (She is referring to the first black women who worked for Langley Research Center at NASA as computers.)

- **contributions**

“What does contributions mean? What do you know about its part of speech or related words?” (Contributions refers to things that are given or done, usually to help a situation or to cause something to happen. This word is a noun; it ends in -tion and it is plural. One related word is the verb contribute. \[noun\])

“What contributions do you think the hidden figures made? Hint: This is what our book will teach us about!” (Responses will vary, but may include: The hidden figures contributed to space science. They used their math skills to help solve huge problems. They also contributed to social progress in the United States. They were pioneers, and they excelled in jobs that had excluded black women in the past.)

have never been heralded,

Deconstruct

- **heralded**

“What do you think the word heralded means? What strategies can you use to make a guess about its meaning?” (Responses will vary, but may include: Based on context, I can guess that heralded might mean something like recognized or celebrated. The prologue is explaining why the hidden figures are considered hidden, and one reason for this might be because their contributions have never been recognized or acknowledged by others. \[verb\])

- Some students might recognize the word from the carol “Hark! The Herald Angels Sing.” If they are familiar with this song, they may also derive some contextual information from its lyrics.

- Students should compare their guess against the two meanings (A and B) of **heralded** and select the meaning that is appropriate for this sentence (B).

1.  to be a sign of something that is beginning to happen or will happen soon

2.  to praise enthusiastically and publicly

but they deserve to be remembered

Deconstruct

- **they**

“In what ways is the pronoun they in this chunk vague or ambiguous? You can look at the sentence in the text, if you need to.” (It isn’t clear what the antecedent for this pronoun is. It is probably these African American women, but it could also be \[t\]he contributions. Both are plural nouns that came earlier in the sentence. The former makes more sense, but the latter was the focus of the first half of the sentence, so it could remain the focus of the second half. \[pronoun\])

- On their note-catchers, students can rewrite this chunk to remove the vague pronoun and replace it with a clear plural noun.  Step 2

—and not as a side note in someone else’s account, but as the center of their own  
story.

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- **—**

“What does this punctuation mark tell us about the rest of the chunk?” (Responses will vary, but may include: The dash tells us that this is an extra, and probably important, piece of information. It is not part of the core sentence, but it provides additional content that might be useful to understand the context or the impact of the sentence overall.)

- **not as . . . but as . . .**

“What does this structure tell us about the relationship between the ideas in this chunk?” (Responses will vary, but may include that Shetterly is signaling a contrast; she is correcting a misconception.)

- **as a side note in someone else’s account**

“What other accounts, or stories, do you think Shetterly is referring to in this chunk?” (Responses will vary, but may include: She could be referring to more popular stories in space science, like stories about famous astronauts like Neil Armstrong or Buzz Aldrin. In those stories, the hidden figures might be treated as just a side note, rather than as the focus of the story.)

“What does it mean if the hidden figures are a side note in these other stories?” (It means that they are not the focus. The stories are not about them.)

“Can you say this chunk in your own words?” (Responses will vary, but may include: the accomplishments of the hidden figures are worthy of being written about, studied, and celebrated on their own.)

- **Students can use Conversation Cues as they discuss. To provide heavier support, display a suggested sequence, such as the one below:**

- I’ll give you time to discuss this with a partner. (Goal 1)

- Can you say more about that? (Goal 1)

- Who can explain why your classmate came up with that response? (Goal 4)

- Who can add on to what your classmate said? (Goal 1)

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Students can complete this sentence frame to talk about something that they want to do someday. After the dash, students can include additional information that clarifies your role in that activity.

> **Someday, I want to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_—and not as \_\_\_\_\_\_\_, but as \_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**
>
> (Someday, I want to be on a Broadway stage—and not as a backup dancer, but as the star.)  Step 4

- To provide lighter support: “Can we divide this sentence into two or more sentences? What do we have to remove or change?”

- To provide heavier support: Provide options for students to select from to fill in the first blank (e.g., graduate from high school, work for NASA, play professional soccer).

The contributions made by these African American women have never been heralded, but they deserve to be remembered—and not as a side note in someone else’s account, but as the center of their own story.

Reconstruct

- Ask:

“What does this sentence tell us about Shetterly’s purpose for writing Hidden Figures?” (Responses will vary, but may include that this sentence tells us that Shetterly’s purpose for writing Hidden Figures is to create a space to center the stories of the black women who worked at Langley.)

“If the final chunk—after the dash—were removed, how might Shetterly’s purpose be less clear?” (Responses will vary, but may include: The final chunk tells us specifically that the women deserve to be at the center of their own story. This clarifies that her purpose is to write that story that has been missing and share information about these women with the world. Without that final chunk, the purpose is still implicit, but it would be stated less clearly.)

What does this sentence tell us about Shetterly’s point of view toward the women she describes? What words help convey her point of view?” (Responses will vary, but may include: This sentence tells us that Shetterly admires the women and believes that they have accomplished remarkable things, worthy of praise and recognition. Words like heralded and deserve help convey this point of view.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question: Why is it important to study the accomplishments of the hidden figures and of others whose stories have gone unrecognized?” (Responses will vary, but may include that this sentence highlights the idea that people who accomplish remarkable things deserve praise and recognition.)

Practice (Sentence)

- Students can complete the following sentence to address the module guiding question. Include parenthetical information that provides an additional explanation of why it is important to study the accomplishments of the hidden figures.

> **It is important to study the accomplishments of the hidden figures because they were pioneers in the field of space science—and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**
>
> (It is important to study the accomplishments of the hidden figures because they were pioneers in the field of space science—and they persevered in the face of discrimination.)  Step 5

- To provide lighter support: “Can you write another sentence that addresses the first module guiding question: **What was the Apollo 11 mission, and in what scientific, political and social context did it take place,** and includes another dash to introduce additional information?”

- To provide heavier support: Invite students to discuss the meaning of the sentence frame, and brainstorm possible ways to complete the frame, in home language groups.
