English Language Learners: Grade 6: Module 4: Unit 2: Teaching Notes

Remarkable Accomplishments of the Hidden Figures

Teaching Notes for Unit 2

Prioritize Lessons for Classrooms with Many English Language Learners

In Unit 2, students begin the anchor text, *Hidden Figures* (Young Readers’ Edition). They also read several supplemental texts that support their understanding of *Hidden Figures* and invite deeper thinking (e.g., through compare and contrast activities). In preparation for the mid-unit assessment of Lesson 7, consider prioritizing Lessons 3 and 5, during which students read and then revisit the supplemental text “Moon Dust and Black Disgust.” The central ideas of this text (examined in Lesson 3) inform students’ understanding of the anchor text and the module as a whole. Additionally, a close read of this same text in Lesson 5 guides students through the process of tracing an argument, understanding its main claim, and identifying evidence that supports the claim. Students will complete similar work with a chapter from the anchor text during the mid-unit assessment. To prepare students for the end of unit assessment, during which students compare and contrast multiple authors’ presentations of the same events, prioritize instruction in Lessons 8 and 10, which feature similar compare and contrast tasks with different texts. Also, Lessons 1, 4, and 11 contain Language Dives, which support reading abilities for students at all proficiency levels, though are particularly critical for ELLs, as these approaches accelerate language development through a close look at structure and vocabulary. These Language Dives target key standards assessed on the mid-unit and end of unit assessments.

Language Dives

In Lessons 1, 4, and 11, students participate in Language Dives that use sentences from *Hidden Figures*. In Lesson 1, students analyze a sentence from the prologue and discuss Margot Lee Shetterly’s purpose for writing the text, as well as her point of view toward the hidden figures. This sentence and Dive are also deeply connected to one of the module guiding questions: why is it important to study the accomplishments of the “hidden figures” and of others whose stories have gone unrecognized? In Lesson 4, students examine a sentence for its pronoun use and for its presentation of an important idea in the text. The Practice section of this Language Dive provides students with a sentence frame that can be integrated into their collaborative and independent argument essays during Unit 3. In Lesson 11, students explore Shetterly’s use of commas to set off a nonrestrictive element in the sentence. This Language Dive also previews work with a Grade 7 Language standard by introducing the concept of dangling modifiers.

Module 4 Language Dives continue to follow a modified process that was introduced in Module 3. Modules 3 and 4 Language Dives provide options for questions and activities that continue to teach students how English works. This process allows students to take more of the lead in the conversation and build greater independence by taking an inquiry-based approach to language in general, and the selected sentence in particular. Although students should briefly discuss all chunks in each Language Dive sentence, the new format invites them to slow down during one chunk, called the focus structure, to investigate and practice a particularly compelling language structure.

Most Language Dives implicitly address a wide range of Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening, and Language standards. Once comfortable with Language Dives, supplement the focus standards in a particular Language Dive with additional standards to meet their students’ needs. Note that the Rationale section of each Language Dive also identifies supporting standards that are explicitly addressed but are not the main focus of the Language Dive.

Language Chunk Wall

Continue to develop a “Language Chunk Wall” to extend student capacity to use Language Dive structures. The Language Chunk Wall, first introduced in Module 2, is an area in the classroom where students can display and categorize the academic phrases discussed in each Language Dive. At the end of each Language Dive, students are invited to place the Language Dive sentence chunk strips on the Language Chunk Wall into corresponding categories, such as “Nouns and Noun Phrases” or “Linking Language.” See each Language Dive for suggested categories. Consider color-coding each category for additional support, for example, blue for nouns, pronouns, and subjects; red for predicates and verbs; yellow for adjectives; and green for adverbs, prepositions, and conjunctions. Students can then refer to the wall during subsequent speaking and writing tasks.

Mini Language Dives

Mini Language Dives have the same overall purpose and follow the same general process as full Language Dives, but are condensed to 5 minutes, narrowing students’ attention on deconstructing the focus structure, reconstructing the sentence, and practicing the focus structure. Mini Language Dives give ELLs additional support in building language and literacy skills, as well as habits of mind. Mini Language Dives are most often optional and can be found in the corresponding lessons within this guide. When required for all students, Mini Language Dives are built into the body of the lesson in the Teacher Guide. Note that, in this unit, there are optional Mini Language Dives in Lessons 3 and 10.

Diversity and Inclusion

Investigate the routines, practices, rituals, beliefs, norms, and experiences that are important to ELLs and their families. Integrate this background into the classroom as students engage with texts. Create a supportive and inclusive classroom environment by reminding students that everyone is working toward improvement. Be sure to highlight and praise growth and development rather than relative performance. Check in with students at strategic points during the unit to invite students to connect their personal experiences to the topic or text. Note that *Hidden Figures* describes the rampant racial discrimination of the world in which the hidden figures lived. The experiences of the hidden figures may be challenging for students to read about, perhaps especially if they or their families have personally experienced discrimination. Carefully review the Support All Students sections of the lessons to better prepare for difficult passages and for the impact these passages may have on students. Consult with a guidance counselor, school social worker, or ESL teacher for further investigation of diversity and inclusion.

Conversation Cues

Encourage productive and equitable conversation with Conversation Cues, which are questions to ask students that help achieve four goals:

- (Goal 1) encourage all students to talk and be understood;

- (Goal 2) listen carefully to one another and seek to understand;

- (Goal 3) deepen thinking; and

- (Goal 4) think with others to expand the conversation (adapted from Michaels, Sarah, and Cathy O’Connor. *Talk Science Primer*. TERC, 2012. http://inquiryproject.terc.edu/shared/pd/TalkScience_Primer.pdf. Based on Chapin, S., O’Connor, C., and Anderson, N. \[2009\]. *Classroom Discussions: Using Math Talk to Help Students Learn, Grades K–6*. Second Edition. Math Solutions Publications).

Refer to the Tools Page (http://eled.org/tools) for the complete set of cues. Goal 1 Conversation Cues are introduced in Lesson 1, and suggestions for integrating Conversation Cues into instruction are presented across lessons. For ELLs, Conversation Cues are especially critical because they improve language processing abilities and increase engagement and participation.

Use Conversation Cues as often as possible to gradually release thinking and expression of ideas to students; avoid using Conversation Cues as a way of searching for the “right” answer. Students often struggle to create productive and equitable conversation during Turn and Talk or Think-Pair-Share protocols; Conversation Cues can make the difference. Recall that the main goals of Conversation Cues are supporting students to express their ideas (Goal 1), listen to other students’ ideas (Goal 2), deepen their own ideas (Goal 3), and build on other students’ ideas (Goal 4).

Consider this model transcription from a classroom where about eight-five percent of students are ELLs. The teacher is supporting students to build their ideas about the choice an author made when writing this sentence about an athlete’s factors for success: **There were many factors that led to Rickey’s success, but it was support from others in baseball that was most important.** Students can carry the Conversation Cues into small groups to support their own independent productive and equitable conversations.

Mr. Valencia: What if I replace **but** with **and**? **And** is also a conjunction. How would **and** change the meaning? I'll give you some time to think. Emma, you want to give it a shot?

Emma: It is adding on to the, like, the idea, of the first (part of the) sentence?

Mr. Valencia: Can anyone repeat or rephrase what Emma just said?

Santiago: It would have the same idea as the first two chunks.

Mr. Valencia: Right, **and** would have the same idea as the first two chunks. Two connecting, same ideas. So how does **but** change that for me? Jazmin?

Jazmin: **But** would change it.

Mr. Valencia: Can you say more about that, Jazmin?

Jazmin: It would change it because **but** would say there are many things happening, but this is the one.

Mr. Valencia: So does anyone want to add something else to that?

Daniel: **But** is saying this is the main thing happening.

Mr. Valencia: Right, now the sentence is going to the main factor (for success), or a contrast. **But** is something that is going to tell us a contrast. (Exchange continues.)

Differentiated Materials

Differentiated materials, including entrance tickets and note-catchers, are available for ELLs and other students who would benefit from an increased level of support. These resources have been modified for the purposes of creating accessibility to content and concepts and supporting language development. Depending upon the task being carried out, images, selected response options, answer banks, sentence frames, or model responses have been embedded to guide students’ thinking without compromising a focus on standards and the skills that students are developing and applying to meet them.

Celebration

Celebrate the courage, enthusiasm, diversity, and bilingual assets that ELLs bring to the classroom. Additionally, students can celebrate their successful attempts at communication and their ability to extend and enhance the discussions.
