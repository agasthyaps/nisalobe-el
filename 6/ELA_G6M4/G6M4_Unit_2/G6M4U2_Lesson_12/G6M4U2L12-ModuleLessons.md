Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.6.1 – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they reread an excerpt from *Hidden Figures* and identify textual evidence that can be used to support a claim based on the excerpt.

- W.6.1 – Opening A: As part of the entrance ticket, students support a claim about Katherine with relevant evidence from the text.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time B: After participating in a Jigsaw Reading of chapters 13 and 16 of *Hidden Figures,* students add textual evidence to their Collaborative Argument Evidence note-catchers.

- RI.6.3 – Work Time B: Students analyze the way in which Margot Lee Shetterly illustrates and elaborates on the accomplishments of the hidden figures in the text and add notes to their note-catchers.

- W.6.1 – Work Time B: Students add relevant evidence to their note-catchers, which they will use to write arguments to support claims.

- W.6.9b – Work Time B: Students gather relevant evidence from the anchor text to support their claims.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Chapter 15 in *Hidden Figures* is skipped in this lesson due to time constraints. Encourage students to read this additional chapter. Chapter 15 introduces a fourth hidden figure, Christine Mann. Practice similar work with determining point of view and tracing an argument with the chapters focused on Mann’s remarkable accomplishments, which will not be included in this module.

- Extend the learning around aeronautics introduced in the chapters read during this lesson by directing students toward online resources that offer additional STEM practice, such as http://eled.org/0168.

- Students who show great interest in and advanced knowledge of the module may serve as discussion captains during the independent research reading share.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students were introduced to a new hidden figure, Katherine Johnson, by reading chapter 12 in *Hidden Figures*. They also participated in a Language Dive to examine how the author develops Katherine’s character. In this lesson, students will move into jigsaw expert groups and read another chapter focused on Katherine; during Opening A of Lesson 13, students will share with their home groups what they learned. In preparation for the argument essay they will write in Unit 3, students add to their Collaborative Argument Evidence note-catcher, gathering evidence that Johnson’s accomplishments were truly remarkable.

- Since the launch of independent research reading in Unit 1, students have been reading self-selected texts on the module topic. During this lesson, students share with their peers what they have learned from their texts and how that learning adds to their understanding of the module focus.

Support All Students

- ELLs with limited vocabularies may find it challenging to understand science-driven passages of *Hidden Figures*. Videos or other visuals about wind tunnels, turbulence, and aeronautics will be critical in helping students visualize the scientific processes described in these chapters. If time and resources are available, facilitating opportunities for students to practice some of these scientific principles in a hands-on way (e.g., through building and testing paper airplanes) will also help students build a deeper understanding of the text. ▲

- Students may be confused by references to Katherine using two different last names. Point out that the text initially refers to Katherine by her first husband’s last name, Goble. After her first husband died, she remarried and took her new husband’s last name, Johnson.

- Not all students may be as fascinated by aeronautics and spaceflight as the hidden figures are in the anchor text. Relate Katherine’s fascination with aeronautics to the passions of students who seem less engaged. Katherine described a report about air traffic regulations as “one of the most interesting things \[she\] had ever read” (105). Invite students to share the most interesting thing they have ever read. Allow space for students to share stories of the topics that fascinate them and how they pursued this passion. Guide them to empathize with Katherine.

- To support ELLs, this lesson features another jigsaw. In two groups, students read and gather evidence from a chapter from *Hidden Figures* about Katherine Johnson. Being responsible for reading and thoroughly comprehending only one chapter, instead of two, helps boost ELLs’ confidence. Also, as in Lessons 9–10, students are not expected to share their jigsaw findings with their home groups until the following lesson, giving students adequate time to work in expert groups to discuss the text and complete their Collaborative Argument Evidence note-catchers.

- ELLs may find it challenging to interpret some of the technical vocabulary used in chapter 13 to describe Katherine’s work with the Flight Research Division. If helpful, support student comprehension of this chapter with small sketches or graphs that illustrate the chapter’s concepts.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.7, 6.I.B.8, and 6.II.C.6.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ entries on their Collaborative Argument Evidence note-catcher to ensure that recorded textual evidence is appropriate, relevant, and comprehensive. Remind students that this note-catcher serves as preparation for the essays they will write in Unit 3; the more effort they put into the note-catcher now, the easier the writing task will be later.

Down the Road

- During Opening A of Lesson 13, expert groups, who read one chapter about Katherine Johnson, will debrief their work with their home groups, who read a different chapter about Johnson. They will also conclude their study of Johnson by reading two more chapters about her work at NASA and updating the Remarkable Accomplishments anchor chart.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.6.8 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as in previous lessons to distribute and review the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 12**. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 12 (example for teacher reference)** for possible responses. Students will also need a copy of their anchor text, ***Hidden Figures***.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as in previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons. Invite students to choose a habit of character focus for themselves for this lesson.

Work Time

A. Jigsaw: *Hidden Figures*, Chapters 13 and 16 (20 minutes)

- Tell students that they will now read more about Katherine Johnson. They will become experts on one chapter about Katherine using the Jigsaw protocol.

- Remind students of the Jigsaw protocol: Students have home groups and expert groups. They will first work with their expert groups to read a chapter about Katherine from the text. They will work with their expert groups to add textual information to their **Collaborative Argument Evidence note-catcher**. In the following lesson, students will share what they learned with their home groups and also learn about the other group’s chapter.

- Display home group (e.g., ABAB) and expert group (e.g., AAAA; BBBB) assignments. Have students move into their expert groups. Group(s) A will read chapter 13 (pages 102–109). Group(s) B will read chapter 16 (pages 132–139).

- Once students are settled in their expert groups, students can begin reading about their assigned section together. Students should take turns reading aloud while the rest of the group reads along silently.

- Repeated routine: Groups record the gists of chapter 13 and chapter 16 on **sticky notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, update the **Gists: *Hidden Figures*** **anchor chart**, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Students continue to identify how key individuals in the text demonstrate habits of character. Refer to the **Gists: *Hidden Figures*** **anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**, **Text Guide: *Hidden Figures*** and **chapter synopsis** as needed, as well as any other appropriate resources.

- Group A: Chapter 13:

- Katherine Goble was invited to become a permanent employee with the Flight Research Division.

- Goble’s husband died. After her husband’s death, Katherine Goble kept high expectations for herself and their daughters.

- Group B: Chapter 16:

- Due to the Soviet launch of Sputnik, the United States turned its attention toward space travel, which was the answer to Katherine Goble’s wonderings as to what NACA’s next challenge would be for its researchers.

- The West Area Computing Unit was dissolved and the computers received permanent assignments in other divisions.

- Dorothy Vaughan’s tenure as the West Computing Unit’s manager came to an end as she too was assigned to a new division.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time A, assign students who need heavier support to jigsaw group B. Group B is responsible for reading chapter 16, which references Sputnik and the Space Race: familiar concepts from Unit 1. The opportunity to apply background knowledge to a new text will support students’ comprehension.

Work Time

B. Gather Evidence – W.6.1 (10 minutes)

- Review the learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze how the author introduces and elaborates on Katherine Johnson’s character in the text.”

“I can gather evidence and develop reasoning for an argument essay about Katherine Johnson’s remarkable accomplishments.”

- Students should remain with their expert groups (AAAA or BBBB).

- Direct groups to work together to add at least one more example (accomplishment and evidence) to their Collaborative Argument Evidence note-catcher with information from the part of the text they read with their groups.

- Monitor groups as they work, ensuring that they are working in the correct sections of their note-catchers, appropriately naming key accomplishments about Katherine and selecting relevant evidence to support the reasons they identify. Refer to the **Collaborative Argument Evidence note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** for guidance.

- Field any lingering questions about the note-catcher, the Jigsaw protocol, or the chapters about Katherine Johnson.

- Explain that for the Opening activity in the next lesson, students will work with partners from the other group, who read the other chapter about Katherine. They will share the information gathered during the jigsaw and continue to fill out their Collaborative Argument Evidence note-catchers.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Closing and Assessment

A. Share Independent Research Reading – RL.6.10, RI.6.10 (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can share my independent research reading with my peers.”

- If needed, refer to the **Independent Reading Sample Plans** to guide students through a research reading share.

- Remind students that the purpose of research reading is to build their content knowledge, domain-specific vocabulary, and achievement on reading complex texts. As necessary, use the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart** to review *integrity*. Students demonstrate integrity by keeping up with their independent research reading even though it can be challenging.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their habit of character focus for this lesson.

For Lighter Support

- During the independent research reading share, strategically use combinations of Conversation Cues to challenge students who need lighter support to deepen their thinking and expand the conversation:

- “Can you say more about that?” (Goal 1)

- “Can you figure out why \[the author presented the information in that way\]?” (Goal 3)

- “How is what \_\_\_ said the same as/different from what \_\_\_ said?” (Goal 4)

For Heavier Support

- During the Independent Research Reading share, strategically use combinations of Conversation Cues to help students who need heavier support be understood and improve their metacognition:

- “So do you mean \_\_\_?” (Goal 1)

- “What strategies have helped you succeed in your independent research reading?” (Goal 3)

- “I’ll give you time to think and write or sketch.” (Goal 1)

- During the Independent Research Reading share, pair students who need heavier support. Invite them to select short passages from their independent research reading texts and read them aloud to their partners. This will reinforce speaking and intonation practice.

Homework

A. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread chapters 17 and 18 in *Hidden Figures* in preparation for studying these chapters in the next lesson.
