RI.6.1, RI.6.8, W.6.1b, W.6.10

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter the classroom, read the learning targets. Next, reread an excerpt from *Hidden Figures*, from the beginning of chapter 12 on page 93 and ending on page 99 (“. . . another West Computer to the job.”) Then, answer the following questions.

**Part A**

1.  Which sentence best represents a claim about Katherine Goble that could be supported from this excerpt? (RI.6.8)

2.  Katherine had few mentors to support her during graduate school, so she dropped out.

3.  Katherine owed her talent for mathematics to her father, who was a “math whiz.”

4.  Katherine’s work as a teacher convinced West Virginia’s governor to desegregate schools.

5.  <u>Katherine was a gifted and “unusually capable” mathematician.</u>

**Part B**

6.  Provide one piece of evidence from the excerpt along with reasoning to support the claim selected in Part A. (RI.6.1, W.6.1b, W.6.10)

Evidence 1:

“Katherine graduated from high school at age fourteen . . . By her junior year \[at West Virginia State Institute\], she had tackled every math course the school offered, so her math professor created special advanced math classes just for her” (95).

Reasoning:

This piece of evidence shows that Katherine showed promise for math from an early age. She was ahead of her peers in both high school and in college. Most students do not advance through their education this quickly, which proves the claim that Katherine was a gifted and “unusually capable” mathematician.
