Synopsis: *Hidden Figures*, Chapters 13 and 16

**Name:** **Date:**

**Chapter 13**

- Dorothy Vaughan met with Katherine’s manager and demanded that he either make her a permanent employee of his team and include a raise or he send Katherine back to the West Computing Pool.

- Katherine became a permanent member of the Flight Research Division.

- The Flight Research Division worked with actual aircraft.

- Katherine’s department was dedicated to examining safety concerns and investigating plane crashes.

- During one of the team’s investigations, Katherine discovered that a plane crashed because it flew into the air disturbance caused by a larger plane that had passed through the area before the smaller plane that crashed. Her findings led to the change of air traffic safety regulations.

- Jimmy Goble wanted to move his family into a nicer home, so the family moved to Mimosa Crescent. Soon after, he fell ill, and his health declined over the next year. Goble died in December 1956.

- Katherine established new house rules for her daughters that would help her balance all of her responsibilities.

**Chapter 16**

- Initially, the word “space” was a bit of an unwelcome term at Langley. The government had strongly encouraged NACA to keep its focus on aircraft that could be beneficial on Earth.

- With the Soviets’ launch of Sputnik, the secret dream of the engineers at NACA to work on aircraft suited for space was finally a reality.

- NACA was chosen to head the work on the space program. Various groups were combined into one, and NACA became NASA: the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

- NACA’s work had been private, but the work of NASA would be very public and heavily analyzed.

- In 1958, the West Computing Pool was dissolved. The African American women were assigned to specialized engineering groups.

- Dissolving the West Computing Pool meant the end of segregation at Langley, as the African American workers were no longer separated from other employees but dispersed throughout the organization.
