Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Work Time A: Students complete the End of Unit 2 Assessment. They reread an excerpt from their anchor text, *Hidden Figures (Young Readers’ Edition)*, about Katherine Johnson and then read an excerpt from “Katherine Johnson: A Lifetime of STEM” that describes the same events as the anchor text. Students respond to selected response and short constructed response questions to compare and contrast each author’s presentation of those events in terms of content, author’s methods, and point of view (RI.6.1, RI.6.3, RI.6.6, RI.6.9).

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners by reading and answering questions independently for the assessment. Prompt students’ perseverance by reminding them that assessments are meant to inform instruction. Use assessment data to make choices about what should be retaught and how to adjust the pacing. Encourage students not to be afraid of making mistakes; an accurate assessment is crucial for tailoring lessons to students’ needs.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Some students may not need extensive review of the assessment directions. Release them to begin working on the assessment while clarification is provided to other students who need more support.

- Students who finish the assessment early should continue with their independent research reading.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the second half of this unit, students finished reading the anchor text, *Hidden Figures*, as well as additional supplementary texts, analyzing the author’s presentation of events, argument, and point of view. This lesson continues those routines in an assessment, asking students to apply their learning to a new informational text.

Support All Students

- As with any assessment, students may feel nervous to read new passages independently and answer questions about them. Point out all the preparation they have had through activities, homework, and in-class reading time. Also, remind them there will be other opportunities throughout Module 4 to demonstrate what they have learned.

- Point out that the directions suggest annotating the texts, creating the note-catcher, or recording notes as they read which they can use to complete the selected and constructed response items. Another option is to provide students with the note-catcher to use as they read.

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment.

- For some students, this assessment may require more than the 35 minutes allotted. Provide time over multiple days if necessary.

- An opportunity to track their progress after the assessment helps students reflect on and celebrate their growth.

- To support ELLs, this lesson invites students to complete assessment tasks similar to the classroom tasks in Lessons 8–15. Students read two passages about Katherine Johnson, which describe similar events in Katherine’s life. One of these passages is from the anchor text and thus will feature a writing style that is familiar to students. Although the other text is new and from a supplemental text, students have been developing their knowledge of Katherine over the course the unit, and thus, many of the details and vocabulary will be familiar to them. After students read the text, they answer questions to compare and contrast the authors’ presentations of events. These questions are identical in structure to questions students worked with in Lessons 11 and 15.

- ELLs may find it challenging to independently complete the end of unit assessment without scaffolding. Nurture students’ confidence by pointing out that this assessment is very similar to the activities students have successfully completed in class across multiple lessons. Encourage students to do their best, and assure them that they will continue learning together after the assessment.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.7, 6.I.B.8, 6.II.A.1, and 6.II.C.6.

Assessment Guidance

- All assessment materials for End of Unit 2 Assessment: Analyze Authors’ Presentations of Events are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback on this assessment, use the answer key and sample student responses (see Assessment Overview and Resources) to help complete students’ Track Progress recording form.

- Using information from this assessment, students are tracking progress toward anchor standards:

- R.1: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.

- R.4: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Interpret words and phrases as they are used in a text, including determining technical, connotative, and figurative meanings, and analyze how specific word choices shape meaning or tone.

- R.10: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Read and comprehend complex literary and informational texts independently and proficiently.

Down the Road

- The next lesson launches Unit 3. Students begin working on their collaborative argument essays about Mary’s or Katherine’s accomplishments as well as their independent essay about their focus figure’s accomplishments.

- Students’ End of Unit 2 Assessments will be returned in Unit 3, Lesson 5 with feedback.

- In Unit 3, Lesson 11, students engage in a genre study of narrative nonfiction. Procure a variety of texts for use in this lesson. Suggestions are included on the Characteristics of Narrative Nonfiction anchor chart in Unit 3, Lesson 11.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.6.10 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as in previous lessons to distribute and review the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 16**. Students will also need their **Module 4 Mid-Unit 2 Assessment with feedback**.

- Once all students are ready, invite them to share their stars and steps with a partner. Remind students that everyone is working toward individual goals and that learning is about continued growth and development.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as in previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons. Invite students to choose a habit of character focus for themselves for this lesson.

Work Time

A. End of Unit 2 Assessment: Compare and Contrast Presentations of Events: *Hidden Figures* and “Katherine Johnson: A Lifetime of STEM” (35 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can compare and contrast two authors’ presentation of events in terms of content, author methods, and point of view.”

- Distribute **End of Unit 2 Assessment: Compare and Contrast Presentations of Events: *Hidden Figures*** and **“Katherine Johnson: A Lifetime of STEM.”**

- Tell students that for this assessment, they will reread an excerpt of ***Hidden Figures*** and read an excerpt of a new text that details the same events as the anchor text. In this assessment, students compare the two authors’ presentations of events in terms of content, author’s methods, and point of view.

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence. Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**, and review what perseverance looks and sounds like. Remind students that because they will be reading and answering questions independently for the assessment, they may need to practice perseverance.

- Invite students to begin the assessment.

- While they are taking the assessment, circulate to monitor and document their test-taking skills.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- Display a “map” of the assessment to reference while explaining directions to the end of unit assessment. This will reduce ambiguity and give students a clearer picture of what they can expect so that they can better allocate their time and attentional resources. An example is given below:

- Read an excerpt from the anchor text about Katherine Johnson’s life. Then, read another excerpt from a different book that describes similar events in Katherine’s life. After reading,

- Compare and contrast the content of the two texts by locating details that are included in one or both of the texts.

- Compare and contrast the authors’ methods in the two texts by filling out a grid to indicate whether methods are used in one, both, or neither of the texts.

- Compare and contrast the two authors’ points of view by answering a selected response question.

Closing and Assessment

A. Track Progress – RI.6.10 (5 minutes)

- Give students specific, positive feedback on their completion of the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment.

- Distribute **Track Progress folders**; **Track Progress: Read, Understand, and Explain New Text**; **Writing Record**; and **sticky notes**.

- Tell students the sticky notes are for them to find evidence of the following criterion:

- RI.6.1

- Guide students through completing the form. The row for RI.6.4/L.6.4 will not apply to this assessment and should be left blank. Encourage students to orally paraphrase the meaning of the Track Progress criteria, self-assess, and discuss the evidence with a partner before they begin writing. Direct students to complete the Writing Record for the writing they did as part of the End of Unit 2 Assessment.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their habit of character focus for this lesson.

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
