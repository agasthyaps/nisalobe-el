Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- SL.6.1 – Work Time A: Students participate in a class discussion to answer the module guiding questions, building on others’ ideas and expressing their own clearly.

- RI.6.1 – Closing and Assessment A: Students complete an exit ticket in which they use evidence from an excerpt of *Hidden Figures* to support their analysis of the text.

- RI.6.8 – Closing and Assessment A: As part of the exit ticket, students reread an excerpt of the text and identify a claim that could be supported by the excerpt.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- One aim of this module is to help students make known the stories of people whose contributions have gone unsung. To heighten the impact and broaden the audience that will benefit from students’ work, consider inviting outside audience members, such as administrators, parents, or other students, to listen in on and/or participate in the discussion during Work Time A.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Students read “Moon Dust and Black Disgust” in Lesson 3 to determine the central idea. This lesson allows students to synthesize the big ideas from that article and the previous three chapters of *Hidden Figures* in a class discussion. The profound insights students gained from reading and digesting these many texts will contribute to their responses to the module guiding questions, specifically, “What was the Space Race, and in what scientific, political, and social context did it take place?” and “Why is it important to study the accomplishments of the hidden figures and of others whose stories have gone unrecognized?”

- Students also read the next chapter of their anchor text, *Hidden Figures*.

Support All Students

- Chapter 7 describes in detail some of the space science principles underlying the work of Dorothy Vaughan and the West Computers. This content may be challenging for some students to comprehend. Use the Text Guide to help students through the scientific descriptions and help elucidate them.

- To support ELLs, this lesson invites students to participate in a collaborative discussion to draw connections between the texts they have read and the module guiding questions. This discussion is especially useful for ELLs, who may benefit from opportunities to explicitly review their learning and connect their ideas. Also, an exit ticket asks students to trace a claim in an informational text, using questions whose structure is identical to those that students will encounter on the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment. The careful connection between assessments and in-class activities sets ELLs up for success by clarifying expectations, facilitating substantial practice time, and boosting confidence.

- ELLs may find it challenging to answer the module guiding questions during the class discussion of Work Time A. As needed, provide time for students to process their ideas privately, through writing, sketches, or silent reflection, before sharing them aloud.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.3, 6.I.A.4, 6.I.B.7, and 6.II.C.6.

Assessment Guidance

- The discussion in Work Time A is designed to mirror the End of Unit 3 Assessment. Consider whether to use the Grade 6 Speaking and Listening checklist or the End of Unit 3 Assessment Part II Recording Sheet (for teacher reference) to assess students as they participate.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue to practice the relevant skills of argument analysis and point of view before the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment in Lesson 7. For the assessment, they identify the author’s claims about Dorothy, develop evidence and reasoning to support those claims, and determine the author’s point of view toward Dorothy.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Review the teacher version of materials to ensure clarity about what students should know and be able to do.

- Read chapter 7 of *Hidden Figures* in advance to identify plot points and vocabulary that may require clarification or sensitivity.

- Prepare copies of handouts for students (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time A: Students may be interested to learn that NASA has since renamed the street outside their headquarters “Hidden Figures Way” in honor of those whose work in space science had previously gone unrecognized. Display an online article or video about this new development to enrich the discussion in Work Time A.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.6.10 (10 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as in previous lessons to distribute and review the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 5**. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 5 (example for teacher reference)** for possible responses.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as in previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons. Invite students to choose a habit of character focus for themselves for this lesson.

Work Time

A. Debrief Module Guiding Questions – SL.6.1 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can paraphrase and reflect on a module guiding question during a collaborative discussion.”

- Explain that the recent chapters in ***Hidden Figures*** and the article “ **Moon Dust and Black Disgust”** raised big ideas that apply to both the time period of the Space Race as well as present day. Explain that students will be given an opportunity to share their thoughts about these big ideas. This discussion will mirror Part II of the End of Unit 3 Assessment, when students participate in a culminating discussion of the module guiding questions.

- Direct students to the **Discussion Norms anchor chart**, specifically on the cues and responses. Remind students that a discussion is not just about saying what we want to say. Effective participation is about listening to others and asking and answering questions. Questions help us to be completely clear about what others are saying and to clarify our own points. Inform students that it is important they build off one another’s ideas and ask questions of their peers to deepen their understanding throughout the discussion.

- Remind students that a focus standard for this discussion is SL.6.1d: Review the key ideas expressed and demonstrate understanding of multiple perspectives through reflection and paraphrasing.

- Focus students on the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**. Remind students that it is not easy for everyone to participate in a discussion. Uplift the habits of respect, compassion, and empathy in preparation for the discussion.

- Begin the discussion, using the guiding question. Students should also refer to their Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 5, the Text: “Moon Dust and Black Disgust,” and the **Module Guiding Questions anchor chart** for ideas.

“What were the main events of the Space Race, and in what scientific, political, and social context did it take place?” (Responses will vary, but may include any or all of the following:

- The Space Race was an international competition of space exploration that began with the USSR launching the Sputnik satellite and culminated with the United States sending the first human being to the moon in 1969.

- Scientifically, sending a human being to the moon seemed an impossible undertaking that required deep understanding of many scientific phenomena (e.g., wind tunnels, supersonic flight, trajectories, advanced aircraft).

- Politically, the United States and the USSR were at odds, and the Space Race became a symbol of innovation and power.

- Socially, the Space Race took place at a time of rampant discrimination against black Americans in the United States. At that time, women of all races were also generally excluded from well-paying jobs in math and science.)

“Why is it important to study the accomplishments of the hidden figures and of others whose stories have gone unrecognized?” (Responses will vary, but may include any or all of the following:

- Hidden figures are often “hidden” due to discrimination in the way history is written.

- Our study of history is most accurate when we celebrate the contributions of all involved.

- The accomplishments of hidden figures are remarkable, especially because they are achieved in the face of adversity.)

- Encourage students to make connections to challenges in the present day.

- Ask:

“What other hidden figures in other fields are starting to receive more recognition?”

“In what scenarios are some voices still not being heard?”

“What can we do to uncover and acknowledge the hidden figures in our community?”

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Work Time

B. Read *Hidden Figures*, Chapter 7 Excerpt (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Read an excerpt of chapter 7 (starting on page 51 at the subheading “What Makes Things Fly?” and ending on page 57 at the end of the chapter). Use **Text Guide: *Hidden Figures*** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students who are ready to read independently or in small groups should be released to do so. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Students continue to identify how key individuals in the text demonstrate habits of character. Refer to the **Gists: *Hidden Figures*** **anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** and **chapter synopsis** as needed, as well as any other appropriate resources.

- Gist of chapter 7 excerpt: Vaughan took the offered classes at Langley to support Langley’s cause to produce the best planes in the world.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time B, students read an excerpt from chapter 7 of *Hidden Figures*. This chapter contains many technical vocabulary terms related to flight. Invite students who need lighter support to create a glossary of words from the text that they think are important for understanding the text. Students can use online learners’ dictionaries to locate simple definitions of these words to record in their glossaries.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time B, students read an excerpt from chapter 7 of *Hidden Figures*. This chapter contains many technical vocabulary terms related to flight. Invite students who need heavier support to refer to a glossary of key terms as they read (ideally, these glossaries would be developed by classmates who need lighter support).

Closing and Assessment

A. Exit Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 5 – RI.6.8 (5 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can trace the claim, reasons, and evidence in an excerpt of *Hidden Figures*.”

- Distribute **Exit Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 5**, and read the directions aloud. Direct students to complete the exit ticket. Monitor student work, and refer to **Exit Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 5 (answers for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their habit of character focus for this lesson.

Homework

A. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread chapter 8 in *Hidden Figures* in preparation for studying this chapter in the next lesson.
