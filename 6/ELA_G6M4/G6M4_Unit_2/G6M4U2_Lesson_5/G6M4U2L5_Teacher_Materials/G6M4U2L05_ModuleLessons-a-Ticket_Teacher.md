Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 5

W.6.10

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, read the learning targets. Then, QuickWrite in response to the following question:

**What is the value of uncovering multiple perspectives about a topic or event?**

Remember to use details and examples from the unit texts, including “Moon Dust and Black Disgust” and/or your own experiences to support and explain your thinking.

Responses will vary, but may include: There is usually more than one way of looking at a topic or event. However, the perspective that becomes best known is usually the one shared by the person or organization with the most power. It is important to consider multiple perspectives on a topic because our individual experiences and knowledge are limited. We can learn from other people’s experiences and backgrounds. We can evaluate with a critical eye what we believe to be true, like Booker Griffin does in “Moon Dust and Black Disgust.” Often the perspectives that are lesser known are “hidden” due to discrimination. Our study of history (past or present) is most accurate when we celebrate the contributions of all involved.
