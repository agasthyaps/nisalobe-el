Synopsis: *Hidden Figures*, Chapter 7

**Name:** **Date:**

- The Tuskegee Airmen were a group of black pilots who fought in World War II. The Tuskegee Airmen flew P-51 Mustangs.

- The P-51 Mustang was said to be a reliable plane, and Dorothy Vaughan’s job at NACA was to help make sure the plane was reliable.

- Dorothy constantly asked herself, “What makes things fly?” Langley provided classes to help employees design better planes. Langley mathematicians were included in these class sessions. The mathematicians also attended hands-on training sessions in one of the wind tunnels.

- The process of airplane design has evolved. Test pilots had to fly planes in order to figure out the planes’ deficiencies, but after the development of the wind tunnel, plane testing changed and became safer.

- Langley worked on the design and improvement of several types of planes: pursuit planes, cargo planes, bomber planes, and experimental planes. The Langley Laboratory was thought of as a secret weapon for the United States. Employees were warned not to talk about their work outside of Langley.

- Engineers gathered data from the various tests, and the data landed on the desks of the West Computers.

- The amount of data was significant, so the computers received smaller chunks of an entire data set. The computers provided their calculations and sent the work back to the engineers.

- Dorothy was pleased with her work, and she felt as though she was making a difference.
