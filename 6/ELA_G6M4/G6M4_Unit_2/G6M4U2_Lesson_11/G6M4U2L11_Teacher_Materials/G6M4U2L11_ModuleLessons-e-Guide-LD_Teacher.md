(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

He wanted her to succeed and he feared that**, as one of the school’s first black students,** she might have trouble accessing the books she needed at the white school’s library. (from page 96 of *Hidden Figures* \[Young Readers’ Edition\] by Margot Lee Shetterly)

He wanted her to succeed and he feared that

Deconstruct

- Students can underline all the pronouns they see in this sentence on their note-catchers.   
  Step 2

“What antecedents do these pronouns refer to? You can look at page 96 of your books to help you find the antecedents.” (He refers to the principal at the high school where Katherine was teaching, and her refers to Katherine.)

- **He wanted her to succeed**

“What was Katherine about to do? Why might it have been challenging for her to succeed in that?” (Katherine was about to begin her studies at West Virginia University. She was one of the first three black students to attend this college. It might have been challenging for her to succeed because this was a school with a long history of segregation. Katherine might have been treated badly or denied access to certain services because she was black.)

- If productive, support students’ understanding of the word **desegregate** on page 96. Students can use their understanding of the word **desegregate** and their affix lists to determine the word’s meaning: to stop segregation; to end a policy that keeps races apart.

she might have trouble accessing the books she needed at the white school’s library.

Deconstruct

- As an extension, share this sample response with students and invite them to notice the similarities between the structures of the final sentence in the sample response and the Language Dive sentence.

“Why did Margot Lee Shetterly describe West Virginia University as the white school in this chunk? Can you figure out why she did not refer to the college by its name instead?” (Responses will vary, but may include: Shetterly probably describes the university as the white school to remind the reader of how difficult it would be to be one of the first black students at a university that had long excluded black students.)

“How does this chunk add to your understanding of Katherine’s character?” (Responses will vary, but may include: This chunk highlights the discrimination that Katherine faced as a black woman. Knowing these challenges is important for understanding who Katherine is. It is also important for recognizing just how remarkable Katherine’s mathematical and scientific accomplishments were.)

, as one of the school’s first black students,

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Ask:

“What do you notice about this chunk?” (Responses will vary, but may include that the chunk is sandwiched by commas.)

- **, . . . ,**

“What do these commas tell us about where this chunk belongs in the sentence?” (The commas indicate that this chunk belongs in the middle of the sentence.)

- Remind students that the previous paragraph of the text already told the readers about the desegregation at West Virginia University.

“What is the purpose of this chunk in the sentence? Can you figure out why Margot Lee Shetterly included this chunk in the sentence, if it provides information that the reader already knew?” (Responses will vary, but may include: As Shetterly had already provided this information in the text, the purpose was probably to emphasize an idea. She might have wanted to emphasize this idea because it helps the reader understand why life at West Virginia University might be difficult for Katherine and why her principal wanted to help her.)

- Point out that this structure can also be used to add new information to an independent clause, not only to emphasize information.

- **Students can use Conversation Cues as they discuss. To provide heavier support, display a suggested sequence, such as the one below:**

- Can you say more about that? (Goal 1)

- So, do you mean \_\_\_\_\_\_? (Goal 1)

- Why do you think that? (Goal 3)

- Who can explain why your classmate came up with that response? (Goal 4)

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Students can complete the frame to include additional information. This information should help the reader understand why the teacher wants the student to read aloud to his or her friend.

> **My teacher told me that, as \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, I should read aloud to my friend.**
>
> (My teacher told me that, as a student who loves to read, I should read aloud to my friend.)  Step 4

- To provide lighter support: Invite students to write a second sentence using the following frame: **My teacher, as \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, told me that I should read aloud to my friend.**

- To provide heavier support: How would you translate this frame into your home language? Does your home language also use commas to set off additional information?

He wanted her to succeed and he feared that, as one of the school’s first black students, she might have trouble accessing the books she needed at the white school’s library.

Reconstruct

- Draw students’ attention to the focus structure chunk: **, as one of the school’s first black students,**

“Can you figure out why Shetterly put the chunk in the middle of the sentence, rather than at the beginning?” (If Shetterly had put this chunk at the beginning of the sentence, it would have suggested that the principal at Katherine’s high school \[the He referenced at the beginning of the sentence\] was one of the school’s first black students, rather than Katherine.)

- If productive to help students understand the point above, display this alternative version of the sentence: **As one of the school’s first black students, he wanted her to succeed and he feared that she might have trouble accessing the books she needed at the white school’s library.** Tell students that this is an example of a **dangling modifier**. A modifier is a word or phrase that modifies something in a sentence. That means it defines or gives more detail about that thing. Modifiers are called **dangling modifiers** if it isn’t clear what the phrase is modifying. Dangling modifiers need to be corrected.

- Tell students that they will learn more about dangling modifiers in Grade 7 (L.7.1c), so it’s okay if students do not really understand them now. Congratulate students on working to tackle tricky new grammar!

“What does this sentence tell us about the way the principal felt about Katherine?” (Responses will vary, but may include: This sentence tells us that the principal believed in Katherine. He wished for her to do well and he wanted to help her. He also recognized that she was facing many challenges as a black student at what had been an all-white school.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question: What were the accomplishments of the ‘hidden figures’ at NACA, and why were they remarkable?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice (Sentence)

- Students can complete the sentence frame to include a nonrestrictive element that provides context about Dorothy Vaughan. The context should help inform the sentence and make it clearer why Dorothy’s accomplishment was remarkable. Students can refer to the Remarkable Accomplishments anchor chart for ideas or support, as needed.

> **It is remarkable that Dorothy Vaughan was promoted to a management position at NACA because, as \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, she \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**
>
> (It is remarkable that Dorothy Vaughan was promoted to a management position at NACA because, as a black woman facing discriminatory laws, she had had fewer opportunities and less help than the white men in those positions.)  Step 5

- To provide lighter support: Invite students to generate a sentence about one of Mary’s or Katherine’s accomplishments.

- To provide heavier support: Present this frame as two sentences (e.g., **It is remarkable that Dorothy Vaughan was promoted to a management position at NACA. As \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, she \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_).** This will reduce the cognitive demand of interpreting the meaning of the frame.
