7.  How do the authors’ methods used in the two texts compare?

Responses will vary, but may include: Both texts use anecdotes and descriptions to illustrate situations in Mary’s life. Chapter 11 also shows Mary’s inner thoughts so that the reader can see how angry she feels. “Mary Winston Jackson” includes an allusion to the Girl Scouts to describe Mary’s roles as a mentor and leader.
