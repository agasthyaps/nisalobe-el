(Example for Teacher Reference)

1.  In your groups, discuss ways to rearrange the chunks to make a meaningful sentence.

, as one of the school’s first black students,

He wanted her to succeed and he feared that

she might have trouble accessing the books she needed at the white school’s library.

Take turns paraphrasing the chunks in order.

Discuss, sketch, or act out: what is this sentence about?

2.  Underline all the pronouns you see in this sentence.

<u>He</u> wanted <u>her</u> to succeed and <u>he</u> feared that, as one of the school’s first black students, <u>she</u> might have trouble accessing the books <u>she</u> needed at the white school’s library.

3.  Consider the focus structure.

, as one of the school’s first black students,

4.  Complete the frame to include additional information. This information should help the reader understand why the teacher wants you read aloud to your friend.

My teacher told me that, as **a student who loves to read**, I should read aloud to my friend.

5.  Complete the sentence frame to include a nonrestrictive element that provides context about Dorothy Vaughan. The context should help inform the sentence and make it clearer why Dorothy’s accomplishment is remarkable.

It is remarkable that Dorothy Vaughan was promoted to a management position at NACA

because, as **a black woman facing discriminatory laws**, she **had had fewer opportunities**

**and less help than the white men in those positions**.
