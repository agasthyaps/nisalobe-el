- After graduating from West Virginia State College, Katherine taught in a high school in Marion, Virginia.

- Katherine met Jimmy Goble, and they got married. The Gobles kept their marriage a secret because the law did not allow a married woman to be a classroom teacher.

- Katherine Goble was presented with a unique opportunity to attend the white college, West Virginia University, because no black colleges in the state had graduate programs.

- Katherine discovered that she and Jimmy were expecting a child, so Katherine had to quit graduate school.

- Katherine became a full-time mother. Katherine and Jimmy ultimately had three daughters.

- Katherine returned to teaching in order to help support her family. She worked at the local black high school from 1944 to1952.

- Katherine’s brother-in-law informed her of mathematician jobs at Langley. Jimmy and Katherine decided to move to Newport News. Jimmy secured a job as a painter in the Newport News shipyard.

- Katherine worked as a substitute math teacher until beginning her job as a computer at Langley in June 1953.

- Two weeks after joining the West Computing Pool, Katherine was chosen to work in the Flight Research Division.
