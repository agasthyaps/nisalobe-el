**Chapter 4**

- Fall of 1943: Dorothy Vaughan was in her thirteenth year of teaching at R.R. Moton High School in Farmville, Virginia. After waiting months on a response, Dorothy received a job offer from NACA as a mathematician.

- Dorothy worried about moving four hours away from her four children. In the end, Dorothy accepted the job because the salary would allow her to help her family and she knew that her children were surrounded by family members.

- Dorothy rode a Greyhound bus from Farmville, Virginia, to Newport News, Virginia, to start her new job.

**Chapter 5**

- Many people moved to the Hampton Roads area of Virginia to work new jobs that supported the war effort. People had to adjust to accommodate the increasing population.

- Dorothy gained residence with an older black couple.

- Racial tension was felt in Hampton Roads. African Americans were proud to serve and support their country; however, African Americans began to question exactly what they were fighting for due to the inequality they continued to experience in the United States.

- African Americans felt a divide between “feeling black” and “feeling American.”

- James Thompson expressed an idea in a letter to the *Pittsburgh Courier*: the double victory. Thompson encouraged African Americans to think of the war in two terms: “victory over our enemies from without” and “victory over our enemies from within.”

- Thompson compared those in the United States who still believed in segregation with the Axis, America’s enemies. Thompson explained that both were seeking to destroy “our democratic form of government.”
