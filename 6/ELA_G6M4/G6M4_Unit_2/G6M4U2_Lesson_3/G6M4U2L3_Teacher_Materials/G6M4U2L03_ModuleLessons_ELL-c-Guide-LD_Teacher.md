5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

RI.6.1, RI.6.3, RI.6.4, SL.6.1, L.6.4c

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

Mile after mile, Dorothy watched **the gentle hills rising and falling outside her window.** (from page 29 of *Hidden Figures* \[Young Readers’ Edition\] by Margot Lee Shetterly)

**Lesson 3 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after students read chapter 4 and an excerpt of chapter 5 during Work Time A.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target (**I can determine the meaning of words and phrases as they are used in a text, including figurative, connotative, and technical meanings**) and RI.6.4 by using a familiar word (**gentle**) whose connotative meaning in the text contributes to the idea of Dorothy as peaceful and reflective. Students use a dictionary to help clarify the precise denotation of the word gentle in the context of this sentence (L.6.4c). This sentence also helps students address RI.6.3 by elaborating on the nature of Dorothy’s character by describing a quiet moment in Dorothy’s life just before she begins challenging new work at Langley. Supporting standards: RI.6.1, SL.6.1.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses a familiar word with a specific connotation (**gentle**) to highlight the mood of a character. This sentence also uses repetition (**mile after mile, rising and falling**) to emphasize the passing of time.

- Transfer: adjective + noun + present participle phrase, using words with specific connotations, to present a clear sense of how the women in the text are responding to their environments. Throughout the module, students can use similar sentences to describe other hidden figures in the text, like Mary Jackson or Katherine Johnson.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **Mile after mile, Dorothy watched <u>the gentle hills rising and falling outside her window.</u>**

- Ask:

“What is this sentence about?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: the gentle hills rising and falling outside her window.

- Ask:

“What does the –ing tell us about the movement of the hills?” (The –ing of rising and falling tells us that the movement of the hills is continuous, suggesting that Dorothy is traveling for a long time.)

“In this sentence, are the words rising and falling operating as verbs or adjectives? How do you know?” (They are operating as adjectives. There are no helping verbs before them, and they are describing the noun phrase the gentle hills.)

“What does the adjective gentle mean?” (Responses will vary, but may include, gentle means kind or quiet.)

- If time allows, invite students to use an online learners’ dictionary to verify all possible denotations of the word **gentle**. Alternatively, display the three definitions below:

A. showing a kind or quiet nature; not violent

B. not strong or harsh in effect

C. not steep

“Which denotation—A, B, or C—best matches the use of the word gentle in the Mini Language Dive sentence? Why?” (Denotation C best matches the use of the word gentle in the Mini Language Dive sentence because the adjective steep is also used to describe mountains, ones that rise or fall sharply.)

“How do the other meanings of the word gentle add to the connotation of the word when it is used to describe hills? Explain your answer.” (Responses will vary, but may include: The other meanings convey a sweetness or a softness. Even if gentle means not steep when it is referring to hills, the meanings of the other words make it seem like gentle hills are kind and peaceful.)

“What if the word gentle were removed from this sentence? How might the meaning of the sentence change?” (Responses will vary, but may include that if the word gentle were removed from this sentence, we would have a less clear sense of how Dorothy is feeling in this moment.)

- If productive, invite students to substitute **gentle** with other adjectives (e.g., **towering; dark; darting**), and discuss how the mood of the sentence changes.

“What does the word gentle suggest about how Dorothy is feeling in this moment?”  
(It suggests that she is feeling peaceful and reflective.)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **Mile after mile, Dorothy watched <u>the gentle hills rising and falling outside her window.</u>**

- Ask:

“How is the phrase mile after mile related to the image of hills rising and falling?” (Both phrases suggest that Dorothy is traveling a long distance.)

“Where is Dorothy traveling, and why?” (She is traveling to Langley Research Center. She is about to begin a new job there.)

“Why would Dorothy feel peaceful and calm in this moment? Remember that she is leaving her family and about to begin a very challenging job.” (Responses will vary, but may include: Dorothy might be a peaceful and calm person by nature; Dorothy feels peaceful and calm because she knows she can perform well at this job.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target:  
I can determine the meaning of words and phrases as they are used in a text, including figurative, connotative, and technical meanings?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

> **On her first day at Langley Research Center, Dorothy saw**
>
> **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

adjective noun present participle phrase

- Say:

“Imagine what happened on Dorothy’s first day at Langley Research Center. Use this frame to describe something that Dorothy saw and what that person or thing was doing. Use adjectives with precise connotations to help set the scene.”

- If time allows, invite students to share their sentences aloud or with classmates. Students should examine one another’s sentences for elaborative information about Dorothy’s character.

- Responses will vary, but may include:

> **On her first day at Langley Research Center, Dorothy saw <u>unfamiliar faces staring at her and evaluating her</u>.**
