Synopsis: *Hidden Figures*, Chapters 17 and 18

**Name:** **Date:**

**Chapter 17**

- The Langley Research Center did not have many resources to teach its engineers about space. Lecture sessions were organized to teach engineers, and Katherine was asked to prepare charts for the lectures.

- Katherine asked questions, listened to coworkers, and read about space. Katherine felt she needed more information and wanted to be able to attend the closed-door meetings about the most recent research.

- Katherine asked to attend the meetings where research was discussed. She was informed that women were not allowed at the meetings.

- Katherine was passionate about her work and was committed to gaining knowledge. Katherine continued to ask about her presence at the research discussion meetings, and finally she was allowed to attend.

**Chapter 18**

- Katherine joined the Space Task Group and began work on the first space mission—Project Mercury.

- The space program brought a lot of attention to Virginia. Even with such advancements happening at Langley, the state of Virginia was clinging to the past. The governor would not allow school integration, and schools were chained shut in the fall of 1958.

- Some families were able to send their children to private school. Some families had to send their children to relatives in different areas so the children could continue their education.

- Most of Virginia’s schools were reopened in 1959, but some school systems still did not integrate.

- Prince Edward County, where Dorothy Vaughan was from, chose to pull funding from the schools instead of integrate the schools. The schools of Prince Edward County were closed from 1959 to 1964. The schools in the Hampton Roads area remained segregated.

- Katherine Goble met James (Jim) Johnson in 1958 at choir practice. Johnson was trained in metalsmithing. He became an expert in aircraft maintenance and repair. He and Katherine had a mutual love of planes.

- Several aspects had to be considered for Project Mercury to be successful: shape of spacecraft, structure of spacecraft, size of spacecraft, height and weight of astronauts, flight trajectory.

- Katherine worked on the flight trajectories. Katherine had to figure out the exact path the space vehicle would travel, from its liftoff to its return.

- Katherine had been working with an engineer on the flight trajectories. The engineer encouraged Katherine to finish the research report. The engineer also advocated for Katherine with the section chief.

- James Johnson and Katherine Goble wed. When the research report was published, Katherine G. Johnson was noted as the author of the report. Katherine Johnson was the first woman in the Aerospace Mechanics Division to have her name published on a report.
