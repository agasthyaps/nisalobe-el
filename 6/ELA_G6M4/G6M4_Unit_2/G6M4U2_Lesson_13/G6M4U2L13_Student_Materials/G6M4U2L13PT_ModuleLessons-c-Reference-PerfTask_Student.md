**Smith, Eunice Gray:** (1923–2006) During her forty-year career at NASA, Smith contributed to research on aircraft antiskid braking systems, the use of photographic evidence for aeronautic research, aircraft tire behavior during high-speed operations, and more.

**Tartar, Jill:** (1944– ) As the former director of the Center for SETI Research, Tartar led the institute’s search for extra-terrestrial Intelligence. She earned the Lifetime Achievement Award from Women in Aerospace and was named one of the fifty most important women in science by *Discover* magazine.

**Tereskova, Valentina:** (1937– ) In 1963, at age twenty-six, Tereskova became the first woman in space and the only woman to have ever been on a solo space mission.
