**Directions:** As you enter the classroom, read the learning targets. Next, read two excerpts from chapter 22 of *Hidden Figures*. Answer a question after each excerpt.

Excerpt 1: Start at the beginning of the chapter on page 185 and stop at “The Next Generation” heading on page 188.

Identify an allusion that Margot Lee Shetterly uses in this excerpt. Explain how it helps develop a key idea.

Responses will vary, but may include: Shetterly includes an allusion to Martin Luther King, Jr. and his “I Have a Dream” speech. This allusion helps develop the idea that there were major social problems at the time of Apollo 11. It also helps develop the idea that the accomplishments of the hidden figures were truly remarkable. They lived in a place and at a time of terrible discrimination and they still achieved incredible things in space science.

Excerpt 2: Start at the second paragraph on page 191, which begins with “For Katherine, doing her job meant quietly sharing the joy . . . .” Read to the end of the chapter on page 193.

What habits of character do Katherine and the other engineers and mathematicians demonstrate in this excerpt? Be specific and give examples.

Responses will vary, but may include: The engineers and mathematicians show perseverance. Their work is very challenging, and they don’t give up. After the tragic Apollo 1 mission, which killed three astronauts, the engineers try to learn from mistakes.
