<p><strong>Shetterly’s point of view is that the mathematicians and scientists “behind the scenes” were just as invested in the success of Apollo 11 as the astronauts who landed on the moon. Evidence: “it had taken more than four hundred thousand people” (196); “She had given years of hard work to NASA” (196); “there was no way she would be able to relax until the astronauts had landed on the moon, and returned safely back to Earth” (196).</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Differences</p>
<p><strong>The astronauts of Apollo 11 are brave and patriotic pioneers whose work paved the way for future missions. Evidence: “Kennedy’s challenge has been met. Men from Earth have walked on the moon and returned safely home” and “In a post-flight press conference, Armstrong calls the flight ‘a beginning of a new age,’ while Collins talks about future journeys to Mars.”</strong></p></td>

<p><strong>Both authors have the point of view that the Apollo 11 moon landing was a tremendous accomplishment that changed the world. Evidence from <em>Hidden Figures</em>: “humankind set foot for the first time in history on a heavenly body other than Earth” (197). Evidence from “July 20, 1969: One Giant Leap for Mankind”: “The three-stage 363-foot rocket will use its 7.5 million pounds of thrust to propel them into space and into history.”</strong></p></td>

13. How do the authors’ methods in the two texts compare?

The texts use similar methods to convey information. Both texts have vivid descriptions of the moon landing. The authors use exciting details to describe the specific moment that the astronauts first stepped onto the moon. Both texts also use dialogue. Text 1 only has one direct quote, and it is from Neil Armstrong (“‘That’s one small step for man,’ he said, ‘one giant leap for mankind.’”) Text 2, on the other hand, has many quotes from all three astronauts on Apollo 11. Both texts also use allusion to Kennedy’s speech about sending human beings to the moon. Text 1 has additional allusions to the Civil Rights Movement and the Poor People’s March. One big difference is that text 1 includes Katherine’s inner thoughts, whereas text 2 does not include any inner thoughts. In text 2, the reader can also learn about what the astronauts are thinking, but it is through direct quotes instead of inner thoughts.
