Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.6.1 – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they read two excerpts from chapter 22 of *Hidden Figures (Young Readers’ Edition)* and use textual evidence to answer questions about the text.

- RI.6.3 – Opening A: As part of the entrance ticket, students analyze how the author uses allusion to help develop key ideas in *Hidden Figures*.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time A: Students read chapter 23 of the anchor text. They use textual evidence to support their analysis of the text’s content, as well as the author’s methods and point of view presented in the text.

- RI.6.3 – Work Time A: Students note the way the author presents and elaborates on events in chapter 23.

- RI.6.6 – Work Time A: Students identify the author’s point of view toward events in the chapter.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time B: Students read a supplemental text, “July 20, 1969: One Giant Leap for Mankind.” They use textual evidence to support their analysis of the text’s content, as well as the authors’ methods and points of view presented in the texts.

- RI.6.3 – Work Time B: Students note the way the author presents and elaborates on events in the supplemental text.

- RI.6.6 – Work Time B: Students identify the author’s point of view toward events in the text.

- RI.6.9 – Work Time C: Students answer questions about the similarities and differences between the two texts on their Compare and Contrast Authors’ Presentations of Events: The Moon Landing note-catchers.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- The NASA webpage that features the text used in Work Time B (“July 20, 1969: One Giant Leap for Mankind”) also has many photos and embedded audio and video clips. Invite students who are particularly interested in the Apollo 11 mission to explore the links and images on http://eled.org/0250. Revisit RI.6.7 by challenging students to discuss how the images inform their understanding of the text.

- Students may wish to read the anchor text in its entirety, going back to read the sections that were skipped during class time due to time constraints. Encourage students to return to the sections about Christine Darden and make connections to this additional reading in subsequent lessons.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students read chapters 20 and 21 of *Hidden Figures* and reflected on the module guiding questions. In this lesson, students read an excerpt of chapter 22 and all of chapter 23, completing the text. Chapter 23 describes the moon landing, emphasizing what the event meant to Katherine Johnson.

- Students also read a second text about the moon landing, which describes the same events, but positions the Apollo 11 astronauts at the center of the event. In preparation for the end of unit assessment of the following lesson, students compare the presentations of this same event in the two texts in terms of content, author methods, and point of view using the note-catcher they have used in earlier lessons and then end by answering selected and short constructed response questions that are identical to those they will encounter in the assessment.

Support All Students

- Some students may feel nervous about the upcoming End of Unit 2 Assessment, which requires that they independently read a new supplemental text. Remind students that today’s lesson provides a third practice in the compare and contrast work they will be expected to do for the End of Unit 2 Assessment. At the end of this lesson, students could look across all three compare and contrast note-catchers and take inventory of the types of responses expected for each point of comparison (content, author’s methods, and point of view) to act as a pseudo-study guide.

- Additional work with the domain-specific vocabulary gathered throughout Units 1 and 2 may also help students to feel more prepared to read the supplemental text included on the End of Unit 2 Assessment in Lesson 16.

- To support ELLs, this lesson provides additional opportunities for students to compare and contrast multiple authors’ presentations of the same events, in preparation for the end of unit assessment of the following lesson. In this lesson, students read two passages about the moon landing; one of these passages is from the anchor text and presents the moon landing from Katherine Johnson’s perspective. Students use note-catchers similar to those in Lessons 8 and 10 to analyze the two passages; then, students answer questions identical in structure to those that they will encounter on the assessment. Familiarizing students with the assessment format ahead of time is especially supportive of ELLs, for whom new or complex item types might be distracting in a way that derails comprehension of new texts.

- ELLs may find it challenging to comprehend the “July 20, 1969: One Giant Leap for Mankind” text, as this NASA text includes technical vocabulary that may be unfamiliar. If productive, consider inviting students to skim and scan the questions in Part II of the note-catcher before reading the text in its entirety. If students know what they are looking for, they may feel better prepared to filter unneeded information and annotate the text for relevant elements that support their understanding of the text. Note that allowing students to see the questions ahead of time may not always be a useful strategy, as it can encourage more cursory reading. In this case, however, the questions require either constructed responses or completion of a grid; even if they know what they are looking for, students will still need to examine the text closely and use their own words to present their ideas.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.7, 6.I.B.8, 6.II.A.1, and 6.II.C.6.

Assessment Guidance

- Monitor students closely as they answer questions during Work Time C. The questions they address are very similar to those that they will encounter during the end of unit assessment in the following lesson. As needed, offer additional clarification and support to students who are struggling.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will complete the End of Unit 2 Assessment. They will compare and contrast two texts that describe similar events in Katherine Johnson’s life, focusing on similarities and differences in the content conveyed, the authors’ methods used to convey that content, and points of view.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Read chapters 22 and 23 in *Hidden Figures* in advance to identify plot points and vocabulary that may require clarification or sensitivity.

- Read Text: “July 20, 1969: One Giant Leap for Mankind” in advance to identify plot points and vocabulary that may require clarification or sensitivity.

- Prepare copies of handouts for students (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time C: Develop visual representations of the similarities and differences in content, authors’ methods, and points of view in the two texts they read. Invite students to experiment with a free online design tool, such as http://eled.org/0254, to develop visually arresting Venn diagrams that creatively display their compare/contrast work.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.6.3 (10 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as in previous lessons to distribute and review the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 15**. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 15 (example for teacher reference)** for possible responses. Ensure that the **Habits of Character anchor charts** are available for student reference. Students will also need a copy of their anchor text, ***Hidden Figures***.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as in previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons. Invite students to choose a habit of character focus for themselves for this lesson.

Work Time

A. Analyze Content, Author’s Methods, and Point of View: *Hidden Figures*, Chapter 23 – RI.6.3, RI.6.6 (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can compare and contrast two authors’ presentations of the moon landing in terms of content, author methods, and point of view.”

- Tell students that they are going to again compare two authors’ presentations of the same event. Remind students that they completed similar activities in Lessons 8 and 10. In today’s lesson, they will read two texts and focus on two authors’ presentations of the moon landing.

- Tell students that the first text they will read is chapter 23 of *Hidden Figures*. Invite students to follow along as the chapter (pages 194–198) is read aloud. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky notes**, update the **Gists: *Hidden Figures*** **anchor chart**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Refer to the **Gists: *Hidden Figures*** **anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**, **Text Guide: *Hidden Figures***, and **chapter synopsis** as needed, as well as any other appropriate resources. Congratulate students on completing the text!

- Give students time to record their observations about content, author methods, and point of view on **scrap paper**. Remind students they can use the **Author’s Methods anchor chart** to help them complete the task.

- Tell students that they are now going to read another text that describes the moon landing. This text was written by NASA and is called “July 20, 1969: One Giant Leap for Mankind.”

Work Time

B. Analyze Content, Author’s Methods, and Point of View: “July 20, 1969: One Giant Leap for Mankind” – RI.6.3, RI.6.6 (10 minutes)

- Distribute **Text: “July 20, 1969: One Giant Leap for Mankind.”**

- Read aloud the text as students follow along. Students record their observations about similarities and differences in content, author methods, and point of view on their scrap paper.

- Allow students to briefly compare notes with a partner.

- Distribute and display the **Compare and Contrast Authors’ Presentations of Events: The Moon Landing**. In pairs or triads, students will work to complete the three tables of their note-catchers. They can skim and/or reread both texts to locate other similarities and differences in content, authors’ methods, and points of view, and add these to the appropriate sections of the note-catcher.

- Refer to **Compare and Contrast Authors’ Presentations of Events: The Moon Landing (example for teacher reference)** and **Author’s Methods anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** as needed.

Work Time

C. Compare and Contrast Presentations of Events – RI.6.9 (10 minutes)

- Direct students’ attention to the Part II directions of Compare and Contrast Authors’ Presentations of Events: The Moon Landing. Give students a minute to skim and scan the questions in Part II.

- Explain that they will now answer selected response and constructed response questions in order to compare the presentations of events based on what they gathered on the note-catcher. Tell students that this format mirrors the one they will see on the end of unit assessment in the following lesson.

- Students should work independently to complete the questions. Monitor students as they work and field questions. Refer to Compare and Contrast Authors’ Presentations of Events: The Moon Landing (example for teacher reference) as needed.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- Add a visual component to the compare and contrast activity of Work Time C. Invite students who need heavier support to sketch the images of the moon landing that are presented in the two texts. Students can use a coding system to mark what is the same and what is different about their two sketches (e.g., circle differences in red colored pencil and similarities in blue). This process may help students effectively compare and contrast the content and authors’ points of view presented in the two texts.

Closing and Assessment

A. Debrief: Compare and Contrast Presentations of Events – SL.6.1 (5 minutes)

- Refocus students, and move them into a circle with their completed Compare and Contrast Authors’ Presentations of Events: The Moon Landing. Tell students that they will debrief the answers recorded on their handouts by participating in a “Brain Ball” activity. Review the rules of “Brain Ball”:

- Students place their handouts on the ground in front of them for easy retrieval; alternatively, students can stand behind desks, chairs, or tables, and place their note-catchers there.

- Students gently and carefully toss the **ball** around the circle while one student closes his/her eyes and counts to five.

- Whoever has the ball when the counter gets to five shares his/her answer to the first row of question 1 (the cost of the Apollo missions). That person then tosses the ball, closes his/her eyes, and starts counting.

- The process continues through the twelve rows of question 1, and then through questions 2 and 3A–C.

- Refocus students’ attention, and address any lingering questions about the texts, the questions on the handout, or the end of unit assessment of the following lesson.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their habit of character focus for this lesson.

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
