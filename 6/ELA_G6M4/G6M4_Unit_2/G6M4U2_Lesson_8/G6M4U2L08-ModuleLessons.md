Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.6.1 – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they reread an excerpt from *Hidden Figures* and use textual evidence to answer questions about the content and author’s methods.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time A: Students use textual evidence from two texts to support their analysis of similarities and differences in content across the texts.

- RI.6.9 – Work Time A: Students use their Compare and Contrast Authors’ Presentations of Events: Dorothy Vaughan note-catchers: *Hidden Figures* and “From Moton to NASA” to compare and contrast the content in the two texts.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time B: Students use textual evidence from two texts to support their analysis of similarities and differences in authors’ methods across the texts.

- RI.6.3 – Work Time B: Students analyze the methods used by the authors to develop ideas in the texts.

- RI.6.9 – Work Time B: Students use their Compare and Contrast Authors’ Presentations of Events: Dorothy Vaughan note-catchers: *Hidden Figures* and “From Moton to NASA” to compare and contrast the authors’ methods in the two texts.

- SL.6.1d – Closing and Assessment A: Students participate in a Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol, review and reflect upon the ideas expressed in the texts of Work Times A and B, and demonstrate understanding of multiple authors’ perspectives.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- For an added challenge during Opening A, invite students to generate their own examples of content and methods present in pages 65–67 of *Hidden Figures*. Students can then check their answers against the selected responses on the entrance ticket.

- If students seem ready, they could also compare and contrast point of view in addition to content and author’s methods with this text pair. The table for point of view will be introduced in later lessons and is included on the Compare and Contrast Authors’ Presentations of Events: Dorothy Vaughan note-catcher and “From Moton to NASA.” Direct students to ignore or use as appropriate. Refer to Compare and Contrast Authors’ Presentations of Events: Dorothy Vaughan note-catcher (example for teacher reference).

- In this lesson, students revisit passages of the anchor text from earlier lessons and reread them for new purposes. At the end of the lesson, improve students’ metacognitive awareness by inviting them to speculate on how it feels to reread familiar texts for new purposes. As needed, use probing questions and Goal 3 Conversation Cues to guide students’ self-analyses. These questions may include the following:

- What do you notice about your ability to understand a text when you read it for a second or third time?

- What strategies/habits helped you better understand the texts when you read them again?

- How can rereading improve our reading abilities overall?

- How does this discussion add to your understanding of your own reading abilities?

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Students have had multiple opportunities to identify the author’s point of view. In this lesson, they practice a new skill—comparing the authors’ points of view in two texts that describe similar events. Students are also familiar with analyzing an author’s methods for presenting events from their work in Module 2. They build on that work in this lesson by reading two texts and comparing and contrasting the content and authors’ methods.

Support All Students

- Note that there is a differentiated version of the Text: “From Moton to NASA” used in Work Times A and B in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson.

- The entrance ticket of this lesson invites students to reread an excerpt from *Hidden Figures* that they first read during the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment. Then, later in the lesson, students reread a second excerpt from *Hidden Figures* and compare this excerpt to a newspaper article that describes similar events. Rereading familiar texts for distinct purposes is good practice for all readers, but is particularly valuable for ELLs, whose comprehension and confidence are boosted by additional experiences with the same text. ▲

- The Author Methods anchor chart is revisited and added to in this lesson. This chart was started during Module 2 and contains examples from *The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind*. Examples for new methods added during this unit are from various texts in this module. If students need additional support, add additional examples from the Module 4 for all of the methods.

- Display the Debrief: Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face document so students can see the questions as they are reflecting and preparing a response.

- To support ELLs, this lesson guides students through compare and contrast tasks that are similar to the tasks students will encounter on the end of unit assessment. Students read two texts, the first of which is an excerpt from chapters 3 and 4 of *Hidden Figures*, which students have already read. Rereading familiar texts for new purposes is supremely valuable for ELLs, who may require multiple encounters with a text before comprehending it in its entirely. Students compare and contrast this excerpt with a new text that describes similar events, looking for similarities and differences in content and authors’ methods. Students revisit the Author’s Methods anchor chart from Module 2 and engage in scaffolded practice to reacquaint themselves with related terminology before working independently to complete a note-catcher. This process of reinforcing and building upon past learning helps ELLs concretize their understanding of challenging concepts.

- ELLs may find it challenging to identify similarities and differences across two distinct texts, especially since one of these texts, “From Moton to NASA,” will be entirely new to them. If productive, invite students to skim and scan the “From Moton to NASA” text before they begin reading it and point out features of the text. They are likely to notice that the paragraphs are very short and include some familiar names. This may help assuage ELLs’ concerns about reading and comprehending a new text in a limited amount of time.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.7, 6.I.B.8, 6.II.A.1, and 6.I.C.6.

Assessment Guidance

- In this lesson, students identify similarities and differences between two authors’ presentations of the same events in Dorothy Vaughan’s life. Students complete more complex versions of the same task in Lessons 10 and 15, using paired texts about hidden figure Mary Jackson and about the moon landing. These tasks prepare students for success on the End of Unit 2 Assessment of Lesson 16, during which students will complete the same task with paired texts about hidden figure Katherine Johnson. As needed, take additional time to ensure that students understand what is meant by the terms *content* and *author’s methods*, as these terms will reappear in later lessons and on the end of unit assessment.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will “uncover” hidden figure Mary Jackson, reading about her for the first time in the anchor text and discussing Margot Lee Shetterly’s characterization of her. Students will begin to add to an Argument Evidence note-catcher, which they will use to support the arguments they develop about one of the hidden figures in their Unit 3 collaborative essays.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Read “From Moton to NASA” in advance to identify plot points and vocabulary that may require clarification or sensitivity.

- As needed, review the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol from the Classroom Protocols document.

- Prepare copies of handouts for students (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Closing and Assessment A: Develop visual representations of the similarities and differences in content and authors’ methods in the two texts they read. Invite students to experiment with a free online design tool, such as http://eled.org/0254, to develop visually arresting Venn diagrams that creatively display their compare/contrast work.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.6.3 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as in previous lessons to distribute and review the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 8**. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 8 (answers for teacher reference)** for possible responses. Make sure that the **Author’s Methods anchor chart** from Module 2 is displayed for student reference. Students will also need a copy of their anchor text, ***Hidden Figures***.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as in previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons. Invite students to choose a habit of character focus for themselves for this lesson.

Work Time

A. Compare and Contrast Content – RI.6.9 (20 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can compare and contrast two authors’ presentations of events in Dorothy Vaughan’s life in terms of content and author methods.”

- Explain that students will read two texts, both of which describe events in Dorothy Vaughan’s life. They will compare and contrast the texts both in terms of content and in terms of methods used by the authors. The first text is an excerpt from chapters 3 and 4 of *Hidden Figures*.

- Distribute a piece of **scrap paper** for notes to each student. Invite students to take notes on the key content details from the *Hidden Figures* excerpt. Read aloud an excerpt of chapter 3, starting at the heading “War Work” on page 22 and continuing through the end of chapter 4 on page 29. Students take notes as they follow along and then briefly compare notes with a partner afterward.

- Explain that students are now going to read an article about Dorothy Vaughan called “From Moton to NASA.” This article comes from *The Farmville Herald*, a local newspaper from Farmville, Virginia. Dorothy worked as a math teacher at Moton High School in Farmville before accepting a position at NACA.

- Explain that this excerpt describes some of the same events in Dorothy’s life, though it may leave some information out, or add information that was not in the *Hidden Figures* excerpt that students just read. It is the students’ responsibility to identify what is the same and what is different about the two texts in terms of content.

- Distribute and display **Text: “From Moton to NASA”** or **Text: “From Moton to NASA”** ▲, and refresh scrap paper as needed. Tell students that, just as with the *Hidden Figures* excerpt, students will take notes about key details and information as they hear the new text read aloud. They should listen, in particular, for similarities and differences between the two texts. Slowly read aloud “From Moton to NASA” as students note important content information on their pieces of scrap paper.

- Distribute and display the **Compare and Contrast Authors’ Presentations of Events: Dorothy Vaughan note-catcher**. Read the directions at the top of the note-catcher aloud, and field clarifying questions as needed.

- Draw students’ attention to the first table on the note-catcher: Content. This is the table where students will record key details and information that are the same or different across the two texts. Model providing an example on the note-catcher using the **Compare and Contrast Authors’ Presentations of Events: Dorothy Vaughan note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** as a guide.

- In pairs or triads, students share their notes and observations and work together to complete the Content tables of their note-catchers.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time A, invite students who need heavier support to use the Text: “From Moton to NASA” ▲. This resource features a glossary of key words to support students’ comprehension. If students use the differentiated resource, provide time for them to scan the glossary before reading.

Work Time

B. Compare and Contrast Authors’ Methods – RI.6.3, RI.6.9 (15 minutes)

- Draw students’ attention to the second table: Authors’ Methods. Remind students that authors use various methods to convey information and develop ideas in a text. Point out the displayed Author’s Methods anchor chart, which was developed in Module 2 and which students used to help them complete the entrance ticket during Opening A. As needed, allow students a few moments to reacquaint themselves with the methods on the anchor chart.

- Tell students that the anchor chart might require some updating, now that they are in Module 4. As an example, draw students’ attention to the dialogue row of the anchor chart. Add the word *quotations* to the same row. Refer to **the Author’s Methods anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Turn and Talk:

“How are quotations different from dialogue? Why should we include both methods on the anchor chart?” (Quotations refer to the actual words spoken aloud by someone; dialogue is more specific, and refers to the words spoken aloud by someone to someone else, usually in a conversation. Both methods should be included because they are not exactly the same. An author might use a quotation, but not from a conversation the speaker is having with someone else.)

“How are quotations similar to dialogue? Why do they belong in the same row?” (They are similar because they both describe people speaking aloud. They belong in the same row because they are not different enough to be in their own rows.)

“Which texts have dialogue/quotations: the *Hidden Figures* excerpt, ‘From Moton to NASA,’ neither text, or both texts?” (Both texts have dialogue/quotations.)

- Because the authors of both texts use this method, dialogue/quotations can be added to the Similarities section of the Authors’ Methods table.

- Tell students that another method, exposition, belongs on the anchor chart. Add an exposition row to the anchor chart and explain that, in informational texts, exposition is a common technique used to convey the content.

- Ask:

“What might *exposition* mean in this context? What do you notice about the root word and suffix that might help you determine its meaning?” (Expose seems to be the root word, which means to uncover or bring to light, and *-ition* changes action words \[verbs\] to a state of being \[noun\]. So, this word is the act of exposing. In this context, it might mean that the writer is exposing or directly explaining information rather than using a more creative method.)

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What are some examples of exposition in ‘From Moton to NASA’?” (single sentence paragraphs 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 19, 21, 25)

“Why might an author use exposition when writing an informational text?” (Responses will vary, but may include: it’s an efficient and quick way to convey information; it is clear and direct for a reader to process; and it provides context and background to help situate readers before moving to more complex ideas, concepts, and events.)

“Why might it be important to use other methods along with exposition when writing an informational text?” (Responses will vary, but may include: to make the writing more engaging and interesting to read, to make it more creative, to provide evidence for and develop the ideas presented in exposition, and to bring in other perspectives besides the writer’s.)

“Where do you see examples of exposition in the excerpt from?” Hidden Figures(Students are likely to find many examples of exposition in the *Hidden Figures* excerpt.)

- Because both texts use exposition, students can add this method to the Similarities section of the Authors’ Methods table.

- In pairs or triads, students can continue to skim and/or reread both texts to locate other similarities and differences in authors’ methods. Point out that it is possible, if two texts are written in very similar ways, for the differences sections of one or both texts to be empty.

- As students work, circulate and monitor their progress. As needed, refer to Compare and Contrast Authors’ Presentations of Events: Dorothy Vaughan note-catcher (example for teacher reference). If productive, use Goal 4 Conversation Cues to help students expand the conversation with their partners or triads:

- “Do you agree or disagree with what your classmate said? Why?”

- “Can you explain why your classmate came up with that response?”

- “Can you add on to what your classmate said?”

For Lighter Support

- Highlight or underline key phrases in individual copies of the “From Moton to NASA” text in advance of the in-class reading of Work Time B (e.g., *post office in Farmville, NASA’s first black supervisor, much more than an accomplished musician*).

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time B, invite students who need heavier support to use the Text: “From Moton to NASA” ▲. This resource features a glossary of key words to support students’ comprehension. If students use the differentiated resource, provide time for them to scan the glossary before reading.

- During Work Time B, to support students’ abilities to identify similarities and differences in the content of the two texts, provide students with strips that contain notes about content (e.g., Mentions the *Hidden Figures* movie, Describes Dorothy Vaughan’s family, Illustrates Dorothy’s years in Farmville). Students can determine whether one text, both texts, or neither text contain that piece of information. This exercise will help students recognize similarities and differences in content without requiring that they locate those details and generate those notes independently.

Closing and Assessment

A. Debrief: Compare and Contrast Presentations of Events – SL.6.1d (5 minutes)

- Refocus students, and tell them that they will now debrief the experience of comparing and contrasting two texts by participating in a Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol.

- Ensure that students understand the directions for Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face. (Refer to the Classroom Protocols document for the full version of the protocol.) Use the **Debrief: Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face (example for teacher reference)** to guide students through the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol.

- Circulate and monitor student responses during the protocol. Invite students to refer to their Compare and Contrast Authors’ Presentations of Events: Dorothy Vaughan note-catcher as needed throughout the debrief.

- Refocus whole group. Invite students to share any particular meaningful insights that arose during the reflection. Address any lingering questions about the texts or the tables on the note-catcher.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their habit of character focus for this lesson.

Homework

A. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread chapter 10 in *Hidden Figures* in preparation for studying this chapter in the next lesson.
