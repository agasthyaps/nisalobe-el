4.  Complete Part A, then complete Parts B, C, and D.

**Part A**

What are the similarities between your original and modified definitions of the word **computer**? What are the differences?

Responses will vary, but may include: Both definitions refer to someone or something that can do complicated mathematical calculations. My original definition describes a machine. My modified definition describes a person.

**Part B**

The author uses the word **black** figuratively in quotation B. In your own words, what is the author saying about the jobs that were available for black people?

Responses will vary, but may include: The author is saying that only certain jobs were available to black people. These might have been lower-paying jobs.

**Part C**

The author uses the word **hands** twice in quotation C. How are the two uses different from each other?

Responses will vary, but may include: The first use of the word *hands* is figurative. It means something like extra help. The second use is more literal. It is talking about the color of someone’s actual hands as a way of talking about the color of their skin.

**Part D**

What does the author’s figurative use of the word **pyramid** in quotation D suggest about attitudes toward laundry workers?

Responses will vary, but may include: the figurative use of the word *pyramid* suggests that laundry workers had less power or made less money than anyone else.
