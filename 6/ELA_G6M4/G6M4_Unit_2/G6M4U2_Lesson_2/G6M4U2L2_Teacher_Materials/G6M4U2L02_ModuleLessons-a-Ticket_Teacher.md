(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, read the learning targets. Then open to page 7 of *Hidden Figures* and reread the list of segregation laws (also called Jim Crow laws) that were passed after the Civil War (the list that begins with “They could not . . .”). The list ends at the top of page 8. Answer the questions below.

1.  How does this list of laws add to the reader’s understanding of the context of the text?

2.  <u>It informs readers about legalized discrimination against black people.</u>

3.  It persuades readers to support racial equality in the United States today.

4.  It invites readers to study more on their own about racial discrimination.

5.  It teaches readers more about the individual lives of the “Hidden Figures.”

6.  The author chooses to repeat a similar structure for each item on the list (“They could not . . .”). What effect does this repetition have on the reader’s understanding of the text? What do you think was the author’s purpose for beginning each line with the same words?

7.  It creates a poetic effect that improves the sound and rhythm of the list.

8.  <u>It emphasizes just how many things black people were not allowed to do.</u>

9.  It mirrors the way the laws would have been presented when they were written.

10. It makes her writing as simple and clear as possible for readers to understand.

11. How do segregation laws conflict with the habits of character? Begin with a claim statement. Draw evidence from the list of segregation laws in the anchor text and the Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart to support your response.

Responses will vary, but may include: The segregation laws go against habits of character because they do not show empathy or compassion for other people. If laws are being made based only on difference, then it is clear that lawmakers are not practicing empathy for other people and trying to imagine how they feel. The laws also show a lack of compassion. Keeping people apart causes pain and sadness. If the laws didn’t change right away, it means that people’s pain was disregarded.
