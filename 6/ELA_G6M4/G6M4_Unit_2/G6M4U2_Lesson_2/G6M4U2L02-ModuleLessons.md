Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- L.6.4 – Opening A: After completing the entrance ticket, students use context to determine the meaning of the word *segregation*.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time B: Students complete the Analyze Word Definitions in *Hidden Figures* activity. They use textual evidence to support their analysis of words used in the text.

- RI.6.4 – Work Time B: Students determine the figurative, connotative, and technical meanings of words as they are used in chapters 2 and 3 of *Hidden Figures*.

- L.6.4 – Work Time B: Students use vocabulary strategies to determine the meanings of unknown words in chapters 2 and 3 of the text.

- RI.6.4 – Closing and Assessment A: Students wrap up the Analyze Word Meaning activity. They select one of the words from the Work Time B task, and they sketch drawings that demonstrate their understanding of the words’ literal and figurative or connotative definitions.

- L.6.4 – Closing and Assessment A: Students use drawings to clarify the meanings of multiple-meaning words.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- After Opening A, students interested in etymology and affixes may want to look up the root words of *segregation* in an online etymology dictionary. Discuss how the centuries-old roots of the word add to our understanding of the word’s meaning. Compare the common roots in *segregate*, *aggregate*, and *congregate*.

- As an extension to Work Time B, challenge students to think of other words with multiple meanings and write sentences that use the same word in different ways. Students can share their sentences with a partner and discuss nuances in meaning of their words.

- Remind students of all the different facets of language that they have analyzed throughout the four modules. Note that they have discussed the literal and figurative meanings of words, their denotations and connotations, their affixes and parts of speech, as well as the way words can convey point of view and author’s purpose. Challenge students to design a simple visual or symbol that represents the many functions and facets of language. Offer an example, such as a superhero’s crest, to represent how words are powerful and their powers can be wielded to benefit or hurt others.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students began reading *Hidden Figures*. They started to develop the Gists anchor chart, and they determined the gist of the prologue and chapter 1. In this lesson, students read chapter 2 and an excerpt of chapter 3 and determine the gist of those chapters. They also build on past work with connotative and figurative language by participating in a language activity in which they track the meanings of multiple-meaning words as they are used in chapters 2 and 3. For homework, they read a text, “Moon Dust and Black Disgust,” which elaborates on an argument students analyzed in a different text during the End of Unit 1 Assessment.

Support All Students

- Chapter 2 highlights some of the attitudes toward female employees that were common at the time that the events in the book took place. For example, the author points out that “most employers never would have considered a woman for a job that had always been performed by a man” (10). Invite students, especially female students, to share their feelings about these attitudes.

- In chapter 2, the author also notes that, due to the many men fighting overseas in World War II, “the country needed all the help it could get” (10). For this reason, jobs that were previously available only to white men were now open to women and African-Americans. As students move through and more deeply explore the text, they may encounter portrayals of NACA as a key contributor to progress made during the Civil Rights Movement. Some students may notice or point out that NACA’s mission to hire women was due less to interest in equality and more out of need for labor. Encourage and welcome critical examination of this if it comes up in class.

- To support ELLs, this lesson features a Word Meanings activity that invites students to use context to determine the meanings of familiar multiple-meaning words as they are used in the text. This collaborative activity supports students’ vocabulary development in a scaffolded way and encourages students to be more nimble readers of English. After students complete this activity, they debrief by selecting one of the words and sketch drawings that represent its multiple meanings. The visual component of this debrief supports ELLs by providing an opportunity for them to demonstrate comprehension without using additional language.

- ELLs may find it challenging to identify the intended meaning of multiple-meaning words. To help support students during the Word Meanings activity of Work Time B, the words selected from the text for the activity (e.g., *hands*, *computer*) are high-frequency words that are likely to be familiar to all students, including those with lower levels of proficiency in English. As such, all students are likely to have a solid understanding of the words’ literal meanings, making it easier for them to comprehend and mentally catalog alternative meanings (i.e., figurative or connotative meanings) of the word. As a way to provide additional support to ELLs during this task, consider providing visuals, like through Google images, that distinguish between the literal and figurative meanings of the words.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.8, 6.II.B.4, and 6.II.C.6.

Assessment Guidance

- The final question of the entrance ticket asks students to reflect on their rereading of the excerpt from the anchor text that delineates the laws that made segregation legal by explaining how these antiquated laws violate the habits of character students attempt to embody in their daily interactions. Rephrase and repeat this question in different ways to ensure students understand the type of response that is expected (e.g., “Segregation laws cannot coexist with habits of character because . . . ” or “In what ways do segregation laws conflict with our habits of character?”)

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students read chapter 4 and an excerpt of chapter 5 of *Hidden Figures* and determine the gist of those chapters. Students then grapple with a complex text, “Moon Dust and Black Disgust,” that proposes a different perspective of the Apollo 11 mission, one of deep disappointment.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.6.4 (5 minutes)

- Distribute the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 2**, and read aloud the directions. Students will also need their anchor text, ***Hidden Figures***. Direct students to read the designated excerpt from the text, the list of laws that legalized segregation after the Civil War.

- Focus students on the word *segregation*. Turn and Talk:

“Based on these laws, what might *segregation* mean?” (the practice of separating people according to groups, especially racial groups)

- Add the word *segregation* to the **academic word wall**, and invite students to record it in their **vocabulary logs**.

- Direct students to complete the questions on the entrance ticket.

- Review responses; refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 2 (answers for teacher reference)**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as in previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons. Invite students to choose a habit of character focus for themselves for this lesson.

Work Time

A. Read *Hidden Figures*, Chapters 2–3 (20 minutes)

- Read chapter 2 (pages 10–16) and an excerpt of chapter 3 (starting at the heading “Dorothy Vaughan’s Childhood” on page 20 and continuing to the end of the chapter).

- Use **Text Guide: *Hidden Figures*** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students who are ready to read independently or in small groups should be released to do so. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, update the **Gists: *Hidden Figures*** **anchor chart**, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Students continue to identify how key individuals in the text demonstrate habits of character. Refer to the **Gists: *Hidden Figures*** **anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** and **Synopsis: *Hidden Figures***, **Chapters 2–3** as needed, as well as any other appropriate resources.

- Gist of chapter 2: Jobs became open to women during World War II because men were away fighting in the war.

- Gist of chapter 3 excerpt: Dorothy Vaughan applied for a job as a mathematician with NACA.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

B. Analyze Word Definitions: *Hidden Figures*, Chapters 2–3 – RI.6.4, L.6.4 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can determine the figurative, connotative, and technical meanings of multiple-meaning words as they are used in the text.”

- Tell students that they will now participate in an activity to determine the meanings of familiar words as they are used in chapters 2 and 3 of *Hidden Figures*. They are going to analyze four familiar words: *computers*, *black*, *hands*, and *pyramid*. First, they will develop their own definitions of these words, based on how the words are commonly used. Then, they will consider how the author uses these words in the text. The author may use the figurative, connotative, or technical meanings of these words to achieve effects in the text.

- Strategically pair students. Distribute **Analyze Word Definitions: *Hidden Figures***, **Chapters 2–3** to each student. Note that, although students will work collaboratively in pairs to complete the questions, each student will complete their own copy.

- Read the directions aloud. Field any questions students have about the assignment. As students work, monitor students’ progress. As needed, refer to **Analyze Word Definitions: *Hidden Figures***, **Chapters 2–3 (answers for teacher reference)**. With 1 minute remaining, refocus students.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- Before Work Time B, invite students who need heavier support to work together to generate a list of words in their home languages that can have multiple meanings depending on context. Students can then discuss how they use the context to determine which meaning of the word is intended.

Closing and Assessment

A. Debrief: Analyze Word Definitions and Functions – RI.6.4, L.6.4 (5 minutes)

- Direct students to choose one of the words from the Analyze Word Definitions handout. Challenge students to sketch two simple drawings that depict the two different meanings of that one word: one that represents the literal definition and one that represents the author’s figurative or connotative definition (e.g., one sketch of a modern computer-as-machine and an accompanying sketch of a woman doing mathematical calculations on paper or a calculator).

- Invite students to collaborate with others or work alone. Call on volunteers to share their drawings with an explanation.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“Why is it important to identify words with multiple meanings?” (Words often have a literal and figurative meaning. Authors choose words deliberately to convey a specific meaning; readers gain more meaning from a text if they understand the different ways the word functions in the text. The meanings and uses of words change over time; thinking about how the word is being used can help the reader to better understand the context and setting of the text.)

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their habit of character focus for this lesson.

Homework

A. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread chapters 4 and 5 in *Hidden Figures* in preparation for studying these chapters in the next lesson.
