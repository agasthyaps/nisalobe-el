**Directions:** As you enter class, read the learning targets.

The list ends at the top of page 8. Answer the questions below.

1.  How does this list of laws add to the reader’s understanding of the context of the text?

2.  It informs readers about legalized discrimination against black people.

3.  It persuades readers to support racial equality in the United States today.

4.  It invites readers to study more on their own about racial discrimination.

5.  It teaches readers more about the individual lives of the “Hidden Figures.”

6.  The author chooses to repeat a similar structure for each item on the list (“They could not . . .”). What effect does this repetition have on the reader’s understanding of the text? What do you think was the author’s purpose for beginning each line with the same words?

7.  It creates a poetic effect that improves the sound and rhythm of the list.

8.  It emphasizes just how many things black people were not allowed to do.

9.  It mirrors the way the laws would have been presented when they were written.
