Synopsis: *Hidden Figures*, Chapters 2–3

**Name:** **Date:**

**Chapter 2**

- The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) placed an ad in the newspaper that called for women to apply to the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory.

- World War II was happening, and jobs that had been performed by men were opening to women.

- President Franklin D. Roosevelt believed that the war would be won by the side that had the greatest air power.

- NACA needed more employees to meet the challenge of tremendously increasing airplane production.

- NACA was responsible for developing, testing, and refining the airplane designs before the airplane manufacturers built the airplanes.

- Female mathematicians had been working at NACA since 1935, but they were all white women.

- The need for mathematicians increased with the push for more airplane production. NACA had to broaden its search for qualified mathematicians, which led to hiring African Americans.

- In order to advertise and appeal to qualified African American mathematicians, the federal government created special training classes at black colleges.

- African American mathematicians (computers) worked in the West Area of the Langley campus.

- Since the South had its laws in place to uphold segregation, Langley had to prepare the campus to receive the African American mathematicians.

**Chapter 3**

- Dorothy Vaughan was born in 1910. Her mother died when she was two years old, so Dorothy was raised by her father and stepmother.

- Dorothy’s stepmother encouraged Dorothy to value education.

- Dorothy graduated as her high school’s valedictorian and attended Wilberforce University on full scholarship.

- Dorothy studied mathematics at Wilberforce and did so well that one of her professors recommended her for graduate study at Howard University.

- The Great Depression had taken a toll on Dorothy’s family, so Dorothy declined graduate school and took a job as a teacher.

- Dorothy taught in both Tamms, Illinois, and in coastal North Carolina, but the hardships created by the Great Depression led to the closing of both schools.

- Dorothy landed another teaching position in Farmville, Virginia, where she met Howard Vaughan, who became her husband. Dorothy and Howard settled in Farmville.

- In the post office in Farmville, Virginia, Dorothy saw two job postings: a laundry worker at Camp Pickett, which was an army training center, and a mathematician at a federal agency in Hampton, Virginia.

- Dorothy thought that the mathematics job was only for white women. It wasn’t until Dorothy read an article in the *Norfolk Journal and Guide* that she took the mathematics opportunity seriously.

- Dorothy applied for the laundry job and the mathematics job.
