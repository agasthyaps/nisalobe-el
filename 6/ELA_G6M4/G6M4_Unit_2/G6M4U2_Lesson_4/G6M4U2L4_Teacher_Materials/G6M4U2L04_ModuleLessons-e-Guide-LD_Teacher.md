**Sentence**

**Because of the discrimination,** they believed that African Americans needed to be twice as good to get half as far as their white counterparts. (from page 46 of *Hidden Figures* \[Young Readers’ Edition\] by Margot Lee Shetterly)

African Americans needed to be twice as good

Deconstruct

- **twice as good**

“What skill did the African American women in this book need to be twice as good at?” (They needed to be twice as good at math.)

“Why did the West Computers feel like they had to be twice as good at math as white men with the same job?” (Responses will vary, but may include: There was personal bias and systematic discrimination against the West Computers. Black women had never held those jobs before, and some people didn’t believe that the women could do the work. The West Computers felt like they had to prove themselves in a way that the white men didn’t have to.)

to get half as far as their white counterparts.

Deconstruct

- **counterparts**

“Based on the context provided in this and the previous chunk, what do you think the word counterparts means? What strategies did you use to figure it out?” (Counterpart means someone that has the same job as someone else. The context gave clues as to the meaning of this word.)

- **get half as far**

“Does this chunk have a literal or figurative meaning? How do you know?” (Figurative. The sentence is not literally describing distance. It’s describing professional growth.)

“According to this sentence, even if the African American West Computers <u>were</u> twice as good at their jobs as the white mathematicians were, how successful did they feel they could be?” (They felt they could only be half as successful.)

- Students can demonstrate their understanding of the comparative relationships in this sentence, as well as of phrases like **twice as good** and **half as far** by representing the sentence as a mathematical equation.  Step 2 Students can also choose to sketch the meaning of the sentence, if they’d prefer. Students can share their equations with their classmates.

they believed that

Deconstruct

- they

“What is the antecedent of the pronoun they?” (Responses will vary \[but remind students that responses <u>shouldn’t</u> vary when tracking an antecedent!\].)

- Direct students’ attention to the sentence that comes just before the Language Dive sentence in the text. This sentence is available on students’ note-catchers: **As far as the West Computers were concerned, they assumed that they would have to prove themselves equal to or better than the white mathematicians.**

- Students can circle the plural nouns they see in the first sentence of this paragraph (**the West Computers**; **the white mathematicians**).

“How is the pronoun they vague or ambiguous?” (Responses will vary, but may include: the last noun that was used before was the white mathematicians; however, the West Computers were the they in the previous sentence, making it likely that they remain the antecedent now.

- Students can rewrite the sentence to correct the vague pronoun. (Responses will vary, but may include: because of the discrimination, the West Computers believed that African Americans needed to be twice as good to get half as far as their white counterparts.)  Step 3

Because of the discrimination,

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Ask:

“What does this chunk tell us?” (Responses will vary, but may include: This chunk reminds us of the discrimination against black people at the time. This chunk explains why the West Computers felt they had to work so hard.)

“Can this chunk stand alone? How do you know?” (No, it cannot stand alone. It doesn’t have a verb, so it cannot be an independent clause.)

- Remind students that they will study phrases and clauses in more detail in Grade 7, and it is okay if they do not yet know how to identify or name the different kinds of structures. As needed, ask additional questions to probe student understanding (e.g., If I said to you, **because of the car**, would you know what I was talking about? What other information would you need?)

“What if this chunk were removed from the sentence? How would the meaning or emphasis of the sentence change?” (Responses will vary, but may include: The meaning would not change drastically and the sentence would still make sense. However, this chunk gives context that helps us understand the sentence.

- **Students can use Conversation Cues as they discuss. To provide heavier support, display a suggested sequence, such as the one below:**

- Can you say more about that? (Goal 1)

- Goal 1. So, do you mean \_\_\_\_\_\_? (Goal 1)

- Goal 4. How is what \_\_\_\_\_\_ said the same as/different from what \_\_\_\_\_\_ said? (Goal 4)

- Who can add on to what your classmate said? (Goal 4)

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Students can complete the sentence frame to provide an explanation of why the West Computers formed a close friendship.

- Because of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, the West Computers formed a close friendship. (Because of their shared interests and their shared challenges, the West Computers formed a close friendship.)  Step 5

- To provide lighter support: in what contexts might you use a phrase with a similar meaning to **because of**, such as **due to** or **as the result of**?

- To provide heavier support: invite bilingual students to translate the meaning of this sentence for students who need heavier support.

Because of the discrimination, they believed that African Americans needed to be twice as good to get half as far as their white counterparts.

Reconstruct

- Students can underline all uses of the word **as** on their note-catchers.

- **as**

“What is the function of the word as in this chunk?” (In this sentence, as is part of a comparative structure. It is helping us compare different things in the sentence.)

“What if all uses of the word as were removed from this sentence? How else could Margot Lee Shetterly compare the expectations of the West Computers to the expectations of their white counterparts?” (Responses will vary.)

- If productive, challenge students rewrite these chunks using their own words without using the word **as**. Students can share their rewrites with one another (e.g., Even if the African American mathematicians did their jobs much better than the white mathematicians, they were less successful professionally).

- Draw student attention to the focus structure: **Because of the discrimination**.

“Can this chunk be moved to other parts of the sentence?” (Yes, it can be moved to the end of the sentence, or it can be inserted into the middle of the sentence using commas.)

- Invite students to move the chunks around and read the new sentences aloud, with appropriate pauses at the commas.

“Can you figure out why Margot Lee Shetterly chose to put this chunk at the beginning of the sentence rather than at the middle or end?” (Responses will vary, but may include: This chunk adds important context about discrimination against black women. It is important that readers know about the discrimination first in order to understand why the hidden figures felt like they had to work so much harder than anyone else.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question: How did the ‘hidden figures’ of NACA impact scientific and social progress during and after the Space Race?” (Responses will vary, but may include that the sentence of this Language Dive highlights the tremendous pressure that the hidden figures felt as the first black women in professional roles that they had traditionally been excluded from.)

Practice (Sentence)

- Students can complete the frame to describe how habits of character helped the West Computers succeed.

> **Because of their perseverance and integrity, the West Computers \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**
>
> (Because of their perseverance and integrity, the West Computers <u>thrived under extremely challenging conditions</u>.)  Step 6

- To provide lighter support: challenge students to write a second sentence that talks about the impact of the West Computers using the following frame:

**Because of the West Computers’ remarkable accomplishments, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

- To provide heavier support: invite students who need heavier support to work in pairs to discuss the meaning of the frame before completing it collaboratively.

Language Chunk Wall Suggestions

- Language to talk about a reason: **<u>Because</u> of the discrimination,**

- Language to compare and contrast: **African Americans needed to be <u>twice as good</u>**; **to get half <u>as</u> far <u>as</u> their white counterparts.**

- Language to talk about purpose: **<u>to</u> get half as far as their white counterparts.**
