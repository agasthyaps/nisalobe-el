Synopsis: *Hidden Figures*, Chapter 6

**Name:** **Date:**

- Her first day at work, Dorothy filled out paperwork, swore the US civil service oath of office, received her identification badge, and rode a campus shuttle bus to the working location of the West Computers.

- Dorothy’s presence was welcome because there was so much work to do and not enough time to do the work.

- The West Computers had a designated table in the lunchroom which was marked by a sign: “Colored Computers.” Miriam Mann took the sign off the table. The sign continued to reappear, and Miriam continued to remove the sign.

- As the West Computers were fighting their own battle, an important civil rights case was happening: Irene Morgan did not move to the back of a bus she was riding. Morgan was arrested. The NAACP’s legal team fought her case, and the US Supreme Court ruled that “segregation on interstate buses is illegal.”

- Malcolm MacLean, the white president of the predominantly black college, Howard Institute, was committed to the war effort. Howard Institute established a US naval training school; engineering, science, and war management training programs were available at the school as well. Many white people did not agree and were uncomfortable with MacLean’s ideas as well as his support of and socializing with black people.

- At Langley, engineers did not openly socialize with their black coworkers, but the engineers were generally friendly and open to giving anybody a chance to produce high-quality work.

- The West Computers felt an obligation to help one another combat stereotypes and discrimination by checking one another’s work, appearance, and behavior in order to be seen as equal to their white counterparts.
