> **In addition to intelligence and hard work, what made the accomplishments of Dorothy Vaughan, Mary Jackson, Katherine Johnson, and Christine Darden remarkable? The women achieved great things while the social climate of the South was heavy with racial bias and discrimination. The women exceeded the expectation of the time because women who were mathematically inclined were expected to be math teachers.**

- page 8, “. . . to make a better life for themselves and their families.”

> **Why was World War II beneficial to many African Americans? The Great Depression of the 1930s left many African Americans struggling to find work. World War II provided an opportunity for men and women to work in order to take care of their families.**

- page 23, “. . . accept an application from an African-American woman.”

> **Why didn’t Dorothy Vaughan apply for the mathematician job she saw advertised at the post office? Dorothy did not think the advertisement was meant for black people. She did not think her application would be accepted.**

- page 53, “. . . which opened wide enough to swallow a full-sized plane.”

> **Why was it beneficial for NACA to begin using wind tunnels? Testing plane designs were dangerous for test pilots. Test pilots put their lives in danger testing out plane designs, and expensive planes were damaged. The wind tunnels allowed engineers to test model planes, so this protected the pilots and expensive equipment.**

- page 56, “. . . who used them to improve airplane designs.”

> **Why didn’t the computers (mathematicians) know specific details about the data they were given? The raw data from the plane tests produced so much information that the data had to be broken down into smaller pieces. Computers only received a portion of data on which to do their calculations.**

> **Despite the social progress that has happened within Langley, how are there still instances of discrimination? Katherine was not allowed in the research report review meetings simply because she was a woman. There was no law or rule to prohibit her attendance, but men just wouldn’t allow women to attend the meeting.**

- page 147, “. . . push her children to excel in their segregated schools.”

> **How did Virginia show that it was not willing to progress socially? Virginia refused to integrate schools. School doors were chained shut in 1958.
