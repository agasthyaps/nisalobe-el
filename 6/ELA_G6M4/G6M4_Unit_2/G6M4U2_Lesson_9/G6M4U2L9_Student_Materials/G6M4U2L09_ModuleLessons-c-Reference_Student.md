- Mary Winston grew up in Hampton, Virginia.

- Mary attended the Hampton Institute, where she studied mathematics and physical science.

- She graduated and took a teaching job in Maryland, but her father became sick, so Mary moved back home.

- Mary worked at a community center run by the United Service Organization. At one of the dances held by the USO, Mary met Levi Jackson. Mary and Levi were married.

- After World War II, Levi worked as a painter at Langley Field. Mary Jackson was a stay-at-home mom who also enjoyed leading a Girl Scout Troop.

- Meanwhile, the relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States was tense after World War II. Information spread that the Soviet Union had developed planes that were too fast to be identified.

- The United States increased its efforts to develop the world’s most superior aircraft by increasing NACA’s budget and hiring more employees.

- Mary applied for and was offered a job at Langley as a computer.

- The Rosenbergs were a couple sentenced to death for spying for the Russians. Tension and fear were high for American citizens.

- The US government was on high alert for anyone who could be linked to Communism. Government agents sometimes visited people’s houses unannounced during their investigations.

- Technology began changing the way things were done. Jet engines were the new technology instead of propellers.

- The laboratory invested in an electronic calculator. Dorothy Vaughan immediately realized the threat of the calculator. The human computers would no longer be needed in the near future.

- The electronic computers could complete lengthy calculations in a shorter amount of time than human computers.

- Dorothy recognized that she needed to learn about the electronic computers, so she began to take Langley’s classes on computer programming. Dorothy encouraged the other West Computers to take the classes as well.

- Mary Jackson’s boss encouraged her to enroll in Langley’s engineer training program.

- Mary was promised a promotion when she completed some advanced math courses. The only place Mary could take the courses was at Hampton High School, the all-white school.

- Mary had to ask the City of Hampton for special permission to attend the classes at Hampton High School, and her request was granted.

- The battle Mary and her other black colleagues at Langley faced was a representation of conflict happening all over the United States. The Civil Rights Movement was gaining momentum. African Americans were striving to establish their rights and freedoms.
