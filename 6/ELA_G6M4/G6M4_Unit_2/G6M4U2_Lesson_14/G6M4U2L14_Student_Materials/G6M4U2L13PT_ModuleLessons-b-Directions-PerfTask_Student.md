Performance Task: Picture Book Directions

W.6.3, W.6.4, L.6.3, L.6.6

**Name:** **Date:**

Houston, we have a problem. A problem with individuals not getting the credit they deserve for their remarkable accomplishments. Throughout this module, you have discovered that despite the contributions of many, sometimes only a few key individuals get recognition for incredible achievements, such as landing humans on the moon. For this performance task, you will research other stars of space science who have been underrepresented, just as Margot Lee Shetterly did in *Hidden Figures*. In small crews of three, you and your peers will write and illustrate one section of a children’s picture book, focusing your section on just one of many “hidden figures” in the field of space science. Your story should reflect the factual information you discover during your research but be written to appeal to a young audience. Then you will compile your section with those written by your fellow crewmates to make one stellar picture book to be shared with elementary Earthlings.

**Mission Objectives**

1.  In crews of three, choose a focus figure, and conduct research on this individual’s remarkable contributions to space science.

2.  Determine which accomplishments should be highlighted, keeping in mind that each crew will be responsible for three pages of content.

3.  Collaborate on the completion of the narrative nonfiction picture book, sharing duties as authors, illustrators, and editors with the rest of your crew.

4.  Present your crew’s pages of the picture book to the class, explaining why these particular achievements were highlighted.

5.  Compile your story into a class anthology to be shared with the school community.

**Your contribution to the picture book will include**

- research conducted on an unsung focus figure in the field of space science chosen from the provided list of options,

- the story of this individual’s remarkable accomplishments described in a text that incorporates the characteristics of effective narrative nonfiction writing,

- relevant and thoughtful illustrations (hand-drawn or computer-generated) to accompany the text, and

- a presentation of your crew’s contribution to the class book.
