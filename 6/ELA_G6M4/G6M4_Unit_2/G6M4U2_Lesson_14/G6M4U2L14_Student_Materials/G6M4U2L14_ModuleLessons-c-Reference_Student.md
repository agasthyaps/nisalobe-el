Synopsis: *Hidden Figures*, Chapters 20 and 21

**Name:** **Date:**

**Chapter 20**

- As the Space Task Group continued to work on Project Mercury, the Civil Rights Movement ramped up in the United States.

- Young African Americans began to stage sit-ins at white-only establishments. When they were denied service, they peacefully sat in the establishments until closing.

- Christine Mann, a junior at the Hampton Institute, participated in a sit-in at a local drugstore in downtown Hampton. The next month, five hundred students held a peaceful protest in downtown Hampton.

- Christine worked voter registration drives and encouraged citizens in black neighborhoods to register to vote.

- When the West Computing Pool was shut down, Dorothy Vaughan was assigned to the Analysis and Computation Division.

- Dorothy now functioned as a computer programmer and programmed calculations into the IBM computers. The IBM computers now did the math that Dorothy and the women of the West Computing Pool would have done in the past.

- The engineers at Langley had to build a communication network between Mission Control and an orbiting spacecraft because it was vital that the astronaut was able to stay in communication with NASA every moment of the orbit. Communication stations were established around the world.

- The nature of the work at Langley was extremely complicated, and no mistakes could be made; Langley engineers were unable to meet the original deadlines. The launch date was pushed from 1960 to 1961.

- The Soviet Union claimed another victory—sending the first human into space and the first human to orbit the Earth.

- Langley continued to work on Project Mercury. Alan Shepard became the first American to reach outer space; his suborbital flight lasted fifteen minutes and twenty-two seconds.

- President John F. Kennedy challenged NASA to put a man on the moon.

- NASA needed to expand its facilities and workforce in response to President Kennedy’s challenge.

- Mission Control was moved to Houston, Texas, and a new research center opened.

**Chapter 21**

- John Glenn was chosen as the astronaut for the first orbital flight.

- The Soviet Union was successful at completing a seventeen-orbit flight.

- John Glenn wanted the electronic computers’ math checked one more time before launching; he specifically asked for Katherine Johnson to check the math.

- On February 20, 1962, John Glenn was launched into orbit. The launch encountered a few problems, such as the loss of communication as Glenn re-entered the atmosphere, but Glenn safely returned to Earth.

- A parade was held in Hampton, Virginia, to celebrate the victory.

- Katherine Johnson was featured on the front page of the *Pittsburgh Courier*.
