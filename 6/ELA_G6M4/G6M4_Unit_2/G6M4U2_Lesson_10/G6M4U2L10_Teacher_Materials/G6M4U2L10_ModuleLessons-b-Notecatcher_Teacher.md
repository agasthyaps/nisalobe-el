“. . . embarrassing aspects of making a career as an African American woman in the segregated South.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>• Williams’s point of view toward Mary seems to be that she took the situation in stride and rose above it. Evidence: it was “sort of like when you went to the train station or the bus terminal, and you sort of put your suitcase up on the end and sat on that because you couldn’t go inside. That was the cafeteria situation.”</strong></p></td>
