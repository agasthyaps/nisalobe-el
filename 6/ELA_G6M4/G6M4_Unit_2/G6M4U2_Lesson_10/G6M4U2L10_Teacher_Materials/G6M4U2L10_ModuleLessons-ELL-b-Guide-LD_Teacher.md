RI.6.1, RI.6.3, RI.6.4, RI.6.6, SL.6.1

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

A Girl Scout troop leader and volunteer for more than three decades, Jackson personified this tradition in her work **as an outstanding mathematician, pioneering engineer, and mentor to professionals and youths.** (from “Mary Winston Jackson” from *Power in Numbers: Rebel Women in Mathematics*, by Talithia Williams)

**Lesson 10 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after students read “Mary Winston Jackson” in Work Time A.

**Rationale**

- Guiding Question and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students respond to the guiding question (**What were the accomplishments of the “hidden figures” at NACA, and why were they remarkable?**) and RI.6.3 by illustrating the depth and multifaceted nature of Mary Jackson’s talents and personal qualities. It also helps students address RI.6.4 and RI.6.6 by featuring words with positive connotations that convey the author’s point of view toward Mary.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it incorporates multiple noun phrases to give a clear picture of Mary’s character.

- Transfer: multiple noun phrases in an informationally dense sentence to elaborate on an individual in the text. Students can use the Practice frame in their collaborative and independent essays about the hidden figures.

- Read aloud the focus structure: **as an outstanding mathematician, pioneering engineer, and mentor to professionals and youths.**

- Ask:

“What do you notice about this chunk?” (Responses will vary, but may include: the sentence uses commas to separate noun phrases; the sentence gives information about Mary; the sentence highlights good things that Mary did).

“What adjectives do you see in this chunk? Work with a partner to circle them.” (outstanding, pioneering)

“Do these adjectives have a positive or negative connotation? How do these adjectives convey the author’s point of view toward Mary?” (These adjectives have a positive connotation. They suggest that the author’s point of view toward Mary is positive. The author sees Mary as a talented and trailblazing woman who cared about and contributed to her community.)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **A Girl Scout troop leader and volunteer for more than three decades, Jackson personified this tradition in her work <u>as an outstanding mathematician, pioneering engineer, and mentor to professionals and youths.</u>**

- Ask:

“What does this sentence tell us about Mary’s accomplishments and why they were remarkable?” (Responses will vary, but may include: This sentence tells us that Mary had many accomplishments. Her accomplishments were both professional and personal. Her accomplishments were remarkable because they had a wide impact, both at NACA and in her community.)

“Which noun phrases in this sentence provide information about Mary as an individual? Work with a partner to underline all the noun phrases that tell us something about Mary’s character.” (The phrases that provide information about Mary are as follows:

- As needed, remind students that a noun phrase is a phrase that has a noun as its head, but may also include an adjective or a word like **a** or **the** in front of it and/or a prepositional phrase after it. Students will learn more about noun phrases in Grade 7, so it is okay if they do not understand yet exactly what makes up a noun phrase.

“Can you figure out why the author included so many noun phrases about Mary in this one sentence?” (Responses will vary, but may include: The author probably included so many noun phrases about Mary in this sentence because she wanted to give a clear picture about who Mary was. She wanted the reader to know as much as possible about Mary’s talents and experiences.)

“How can we use multiple noun phrases in our own writing about Dorothy, Mary, or Katherine?” (Responses will vary, but may include: in our own writing, we can use multiple noun phrases to highlight the many talents and accomplishments of the hidden figures.)
