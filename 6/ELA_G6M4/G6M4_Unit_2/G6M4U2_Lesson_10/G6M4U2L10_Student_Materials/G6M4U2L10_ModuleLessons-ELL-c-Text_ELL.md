**Mary Winston Jackson**

**by Talithia Williams**

The experience was all too familiar to countless ambitious, smart women of color on the civil-rights frontier. In a 1998 interview with the *Daily Press*, the seventy-six-year-old retired engineer shared some of the embarrassing aspects of making a career as an African American woman in the segregated South. Giggles erupted from her white peers after she asked, on her first day of work, where she could find the “colored” women’s bathroom, which was clear across campus.

Not permitted to set foot in the whites-only cafeteria, Mary Winston Jackson was forced to order food through a window and take it back to her desk to eat. In her words, it was “sort of like when you went to the train station or the bus terminal, and you sort of put your suitcase up on the end and sat on that because you couldn’t go inside. That was the cafeteria situation.”

Ultimately, however, \[Mary\] Jackson was not deterred from achieving what no other woman of color had achieved before. As the 1947 edition of the *Girl Scout Handbook* explained, a Girl Scouts of America member must be “ready to help out wherever she is needed. Willingness to serve is not enough; you must know how to do the job well.” A Girl Scout troop leader and volunteer for more than three decades, Jackson personified this tradition in her work as an outstanding mathematician, pioneering engineer, and mentor to professionals and youths.
