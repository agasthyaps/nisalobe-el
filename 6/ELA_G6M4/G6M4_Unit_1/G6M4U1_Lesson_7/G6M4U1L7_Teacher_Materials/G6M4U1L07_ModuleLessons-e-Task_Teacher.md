1.  Describe Reverend Ralph Abernathy’s point of view toward America’s treatment of its poor citizens. (RI.6.6)

Abernathy’s point of view was that America’s poor were struggling desperately and that the funds for space science should instead be used to provide food, clothing, medicine, and shelter for the destitute.

2.  Choose three words or phrases from the excerpt that help to convey that point of view. (RI.6.1, RI.6.4)

“deplored the conditions of the nation’s poor,” “space flight represented an inhuman priority,” “feed the hungry,” “clothe the naked”

3.  Describe Tom Paine’s point of view toward Abernathy’s concerns. (RI.6.6)

Paine’s point of view toward Abernathy’s concerns about the poor is one of sympathy, but he also felt that ending the space missions would not fix the issue of poverty and that NASA offered important contributions to society.

4.  Choose three words or phrases from the excerpt that help to convey that point of view. (RI.6.1, RI.6.4)
