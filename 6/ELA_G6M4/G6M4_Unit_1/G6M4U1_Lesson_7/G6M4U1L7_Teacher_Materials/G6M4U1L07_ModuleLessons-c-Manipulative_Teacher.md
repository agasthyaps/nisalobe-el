Trace an Argument: Evidence Cards

RI.6.1, RI.6.8, RI.6.10

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Cut apart the evidence cards. Sort each card according to the point or reason it supports in the article, “This Is How the Space Race Changed the Great Power Rivalry Forever” by Martand Jha. Be prepared to share aloud two responses: 1) which point or reason the evidence supports, and 2) what reasoning the author uses to connect that evidence to the point or reason.

**Note:** Students may argue that some of the evidence could be used to support more than one point or reason. Accept alternative responses if their reasoning is sound.

| **Point or Reason: The Space Race intensified the political rivalry between the United States and the USSR.**                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| “. . . a new benchmark was set by one of the two superpowers almost every year throughout the 1950s and 1960s.”                                                                                                                                                                                               | **Responses will vary, but may include: new records had to be set at a rapid pace because “dominance over space and the race to outdo one another became a matter of pride for both the United States and USSR.”**                                                                                                      |
| President Kennedy gave a speech to Congress in which he referred to the rivalry between the United States and Russia as a “battle” between “freedom and tyranny.”                                                                                                                                             | **Responses will vary, but may include: Kennedy uses words with strong connotation to position American (represented by the word *freedom*) against Russia (represented by the word *tyranny*). The rivalry extended far beyond science; Kennedy felt the Space Race was a matter of saving mankind from evil forces.** |
| The United Nations established the Outer Space Treaty, which “limits the use of the Moon and other celestial bodies to peaceful purposes and expressly prohibits their use for testing weapons of any kind, conducting military maneuvers, or establishing military bases, installations and fortifications.” | **Responses will vary, but may include: The necessity for this law demonstrates that the international community was getting nervous about the escalation between the United States and Russia. Even the United Nations “had to step in to ensure that outer space didn’t become a battleground for the superpowers.”** |
| **Point or Reason: The Space Race was beneficial to the progress of science and technology.**                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
