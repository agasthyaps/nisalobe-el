Trace an Argument: Evidence Cards

RI.6.1, RI.6.8, RI.6.10

**Directions:** Cut apart the evidence cards. Sort each card according to the point/reason it supports in the article, “This Is How the Space Race Changed the Great Power Rivalry Forever” by Martand Jha. Be prepared to share aloud two responses: 1) which point/reason the evidence supports, and 2) what reasoning the author uses to connect that evidence to the point/reason.

**Note:** Some of the evidence listed could be used to support more than one point/reason. Choose the point/reason for which you can provide the strongest reasoning.
