Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Work Time A: Students complete the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment. They read “An Account of the Moon Landing” and answer constructed response questions about vocabulary, figurative language in the text, the author’s point of view, and how that point of view is conveyed in the text. (RI.6.1, RI.6.4, RI.6.6, L.6.5c)

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners by reading and answering questions independently for the mid-unit assessment. Prompt students’ perseverance by reminding them that assessments are meant to inform instruction. Use assessment data to make choices about what should be retaught and how to adjust the pacing. Encourage students not to be afraid of making mistakes; an accurate assessment is crucial for tailoring lessons to students’ needs.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Some students may not need extensive review of the assessment directions. Release them to begin working on the assessment while clarification is provided to other students who need more support.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the first half of this unit, students read excerpts of informational texts and primary source documents, building background knowledge about the Space Race and analyzing the author’s point of view and use of connotative and figurative language. This lesson continues those routines in an assessment, in which students apply their learning to a new informational text.

Support All Students

- As with any assessment, students may feel nervous about reading and answering questions about new passages independently. Point out all the preparation they have had through activities, homework, and in-class reading time. Also, remind them that there will be other opportunities throughout Module 4 to demonstrate what they have learned.

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction during this study and the goals of the assessment.

- For some students, this assessment may require more than the 35 minutes allotted. Provide time over multiple days if necessary.

- An opportunity to track their progress after the assessment helps students reflect on and celebrate their growth.

- To support ELLs, this lesson invites students to complete assessment tasks similar to the classroom tasks in Lessons 1–3. Although the assessment text, “An Account of the Moon Landing,” is new to students, students have been developing their knowledge of this event over the course of the unit, and thus, many of the historical details and much of the domain-specific vocabulary will be familiar to them. After students read the text, they answer constructed response questions about the author’s point of view and about the words and phrases that convey that point of view.

- ELLs may find it challenging to independently complete the mid-unit assessment without scaffolding. Although students have already been assessed on point of view and word connotation, the mid-unit challenges students by requiring that they generate their own constructed responses rather than choosing from selected responses. Nurture students’ confidence by pointing out that the mid-unit assessment is similar to the activities students have successfully completed in class. Encourage students to do their best, and assure them that they will continue learning together after the assessment.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.7, and 6.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- All assessment materials for Mid-Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Point of View: “An Account of the Moon Landing,” are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback on this assessment, use the answer key and sample student responses (see Assessment Overview and Resources) to help complete students’ Track Progress recording form.

- Using information from this assessment, students are tracking progress toward anchor standards:

- R.1: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.

- R.4: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Interpret words and phrases as they are used in a text, including determining technical, connotative, and figurative meanings, and analyze how specific word choices shape meaning or tone.

- R.10: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Read and comprehend complex literary and informational texts independently and proficiently.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students read a new text to better understand the political context of the Space Race and determine the central idea and the main claim of the text by engaging in a close read. This text starts to introduce different perspectives about the Space Race and its legacy as students shift their focus to argument texts.

- Students’ Mid-Unit 1 Assessments will be returned in Lesson 8 with feedback.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.6.10 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as in previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 4**. Also distribute students’ **Module 3 End of Unit 3 Assessment with feedback**.

- Once all students are ready, invite them to share their stars and steps with a partner. Remind students that everyone is working toward individual goals and that learning is about continued growth and development.

- Using a preferred classroom routine, review **Homework: Space Race Events Timeline**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as in previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Mid-Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Point of View: “An Account of the Moon Landing” (35 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze an author’s point of view and how it is conveyed in the text ‘An Account of the Moon Landing.’”

- Distribute **Mid-Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Point of View: “An Account of the Moon Landing.”**

- Tell students that for this assessment, they will read a new text, “An Account of the Moon Landing,” and analyze the author’s point of view and how it is conveyed in the text, as well as the author’s use of words with strong connotation.

- Read the directions for each part of the assessment aloud as students follow along, reading silently. Ensure students understand the directions; paraphrase some instructions, if needed. ▲ Answer students’ questions, but refrain from supplying answers to the assessment questions themselves.

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence. Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**, and review what perseverance looks and sounds like. Remind students that because they will be reading and answering questions independently for the assessment, they may need to practice perseverance.

- Invite students to begin the assessment.

- While they are taking the assessment, circulate to monitor and document their test-taking skills.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- Before the assessment of Work Time A, invite students who need lighter support to briefly review aloud the supplemental texts that they have read in Lessons 1–3. Upon recalling the topics of these texts (the start and background of the Space Race, the events preceding the Apollo 11 launch), students may be able to predict the subject of the mid-unit assessment text: the Apollo 11 moon landing. This exercise will activate background knowledge and remind them of the extensiveness of their preparation.

For Heavier Support

- Display a “map” of the assessment to reference while explaining directions to the mid-unit assessment. This will reduce ambiguity and give students a clearer picture of what they can expect so that they can better allocate their time and attentional resources. An example is given below:

- Read “An Account of the Moon Landing.” Then,

- Describe the author’s point of view toward the Apollo 11 astronauts and mission, and list words or phrases that convey that point of view.

- Describe the author’s point of view toward outer space, and list words or phrases that convey that point of view.

- Read two sentences, and answer questions about how the connotations of words in the sentences impact the meaning.

Closing and Assessment

A. Track Progress – RI.6.1 (5 minutes)

- Give students specific, positive feedback on their completion of the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment.

- Distribute **Track Progress folders; Track Progress: Read, Understand, and Explain New Text; Writing Record**; and **sticky notes**.

- Tell students the sticky notes are for them to find evidence of the following criteria:

- RI.6.1

- RI.6.4, L.6.4

- Guide students through completing the form. Encourage students to orally paraphrase the meaning of the Track Progress criteria, self-assess, and discuss the evidence with a partner before they begin writing. Direct students to complete their Writing Record for the writing they did as part of the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment (short constructed responses).

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their habit of character focus for this lesson.

Homework

A. Evaluate a Claim

- Students read “Benefits of NASA’s Space Technology on Earth” and evaluate how well the author supports claims in the text to complete **Homework: Evaluate a Claim**.
