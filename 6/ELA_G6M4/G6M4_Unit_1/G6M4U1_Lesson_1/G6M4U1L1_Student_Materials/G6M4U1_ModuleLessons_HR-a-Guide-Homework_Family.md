What were the main events of the Space Race, and in what scientific, political, and social context did it take place?

- *The Space Race was an international competition of space exploration that began with the Soviet Union launching the Sputnik satellite and culminated with the United States sending the first human being to the moon in 1969 during the Apollo 11 mission.*

- *Scientifically, sending a human being to the moon seemed an impossible undertaking that required deep understanding of many scientific phenomena (e.g., wind tunnels, supersonic flight, trajectories, advanced aircraft).*

- *Politically, the United States and the Soviet Union were at odds, and the Space Race became a symbol of innovation and power.*

- *Socially, the Apollo missions took place during a time of rampant discrimination against black Americans in the United States. At that time, women of all races were also generally excluded from well-paying jobs in math and science.*

What will your student be doing at school?

In this module, students learn about the Space Race, a competition in the 1960s between the United States and the Soviet Union to gain dominance on the new frontier of space. Students build background on this time period in Unit 1, reading diverse informational texts to understand the political and scientific context that fueled this competition. Students are introduced to the main players most often commended for this monumental achievement—President John F. Kennedy and the American astronauts who first stepped foot on the moon during the Apollo 11 mission. (Unit 2 will introduce the anchor text, *Hidden Figures*, and the many other scientists and mathematicians who contributed to NASA’s success and did so in the face of harsh racial and gender discrimination.) Students analyze these supplemental texts by determining central ideas, using vocabulary strategies to determine connotative and technical meanings, and identifying the author’s point of view. Students will be assessed on their ability to determine a text’s central idea, understand the meaning of vocabulary in context, and identify the author’s point of view and how it’s conveyed in the text.

Though the Apollo 11 mission is generally heralded as an extraordinary feat of technological innovation and human fortitude, students also read argument texts that introduce other perspectives on this event. Tracing the authors’ arguments by identifying the claims, evidence, and reasoning, students consider the perspectives of those who argue that the Space Race was actually a financial burden that distracted people from the bigger and more pressing issues of the nation, like widespread poverty and discrimination. A second assessment will measure students’ ability to identify an author’s point of view and trace the author’s argument in a new informational text that adds to their understanding of the multiple perspectives of the Space Race. This background knowledge about the scientific, political, and social context of the Space Race will be essential to students’ success as they begin their analysis of *Hidden Figures* in Unit 2.

Central to the EL Education curriculum is a focus on “habits of character” and social-emotional learning. Students work to become effective learners, developing mindsets and skills for success in college, career, and life (e.g., initiative, responsibility, perseverance, collaboration); work to become ethical people, treating others well and standing up for what is right (e.g., empathy, integrity, respect, compassion); and work to contribute to a better world, putting their learning to use to improve communities (e.g., citizenship, service).

In this unit, students work to become effective learners by showing responsibility with on-time completion of reading tasks and showing perseverance as they read challenging portions of the texts. Students work to become ethical people by demonstrating empathy as they imagine how people felt participating in and witnessing the events of the Space Race, both those who celebrated it and those who were conflicted by it.

How can you support your student at home?

Read news and magazine articles with your student, especially ones that correlate with the module’s topic. Discuss the key details and the central idea of the articles. Look for editorials that offer an opinion, and perhaps a new perspective, on those correlating topics. Trace the author’s argument by identifying the claim and supporting evidence and reasoning.

Read articles of current global events with your student. Try to read different articles that present the same event. Talk to your student about the point of view of each article. How are the point of view of the authors different from each other? Does this difference in point of view change how the author presents the event?

Share your memories of the Space Race and the Apollo 11 mission with your children, or ask a grandparent, neighbor, or friend who was alive at the time to share their memories of that event. Discuss other historic events that you may have witnessed (e.g., 9/11), and share how your reaction may differ from others who witnessed the same event.

Arrange a visit to a local science museum and/or planetarium to inspire interest in the module topic.

Unit 1: Homework

In Lesson 1, students reflect on the module’s guiding questions. The students have begun each module with this homework assignment and should be comfortable with this reflection process. Lessons 2–4 ask students to work with a timeline that presents the events of the Space Race. Students use information learned from the supplemental texts they have read in class to add events to the timeline. Lesson 7 homework begins the independent research reading for this module.

**Research reading:** Your student is expected to independently research the topic of study in this module, Remarkable Accomplishments in Space Science, by reading topic-related books of his or her choice. Research reading will be assigned on evenings when students are not already reading the anchor text. Students will be expected to read for approximately 20 minutes each day and respond to a prompt of choice in the front of the independent reading journal.

**Choice reading:** If your student would also like to independently read and respond to a book of free choice, he or she may use the back of the independent reading journal.

Independent Reading

**Directions:** Remember to record responses to research reading in the front of your independent reading journal and responses to choice reading in the back. Try to choose a different prompt each time.

Record any new vocabulary in your vocabulary log. Underline vocabulary found during independent reading.

**Record:**

- Date

- Title and author of your reading book

- Pages you have read

- Prompt

- Response

**Example:**

<u>Date</u>: 05/20/2019

<u>Book Title and Author</u>: *Hidden Figures* (Young Readers’ Edition) by Margot Lee Shetterly

<u>Pages Read</u>: 153–158

<u>Prompt</u>: Which habits of character are demonstrated in the text? Explain.

<u>Response</u>: Mary Jackson used her strengths to help her son build a car for the soap box derby. Being an engineer and having extensive knowledge of aerodynamics, Mary was able to use her expertise to guide her son. Mary and Levi worked tirelessly to figure out the best design for the soap box car. Mary and Levi collaborated, another habit of character, to build the best car. They made sketches, took measurements, tested different designs, and searched their garage for materials to use to build the car. Levi had a great advantage in this project by having a mom whose strength was engineering!

**  
Consider using the following independent reading prompts.**[^1]

- How does this text add to your understanding of one of the guiding questions of the module?

- Which habits of character are demonstrated in the text? Explain.

- Which habits of character are NOT demonstrated in the text? Explain.

- Record two or three facts in your own words that you learned from the text.

- Summarize your research reading today in no more than five sentences.

- Explain a way in which you connect to the text.

- Explain how the text connects to another text you’ve read.

- Explain how the text connects to something currently happening in the world.

- Explain how the text connects to *Hidden Figures* (Young Readers’ Edition).

- Explain how the text relates to the topic of Remarkable Accomplishments in Space Science.

- Explain how excerpts from the text represent accurate historical context.

- Choose one new word from your reading today, and analyze it on a vocabulary square.

| **Definition in your own words**                  | **Synonyms** (words with the same meaning) |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Words with the same affix or root**             | **Sketch**                                 |
| **Translation in home language** (if appropriate) |                                            |

Vocabulary

**Directions:** In the classroom, you have been recording words from your texts in your vocabulary log. Throughout this unit, you have been research reading topic-related books at home to build your knowledge of the Space Race and recording words in your independent reading journal.

Choose a word from your research reading or from a text you’ve read in class, and add the word to your vocabulary log. Try to choose a different word to add and to practice a different vocabulary strategy each time. For each word, be sure to add the following:

1.  The definition, or meaning, of the word

<!-- -->

2.  The vocabulary strategy you used to figure out the meaning of the word

3.  A sketch or diagram that helps you to better understand the meaning of the word

Record new vocabulary in vocabulary logs and mark academic vocabulary with a symbol, for example a star:

- Academic vocabulary: words you might find in informational texts on many different topics. For example, the words **evidence** and **rationale** are words that could be found in books on any topic.

- Domain-specific vocabulary: words about a particular topic. For example, the words **aeronautics**, **wind** **tunnel**, and **turbulence** are some that would be found on the topic of space science.

**Vocabulary Strategies**

As a reminder, the vocabulary strategies we have been working on in class are listed below:

- Context: read the sentence around the word.

- Look at the affixes for clues.

- Look at the root of the word for clues.

- Use a dictionary.

- Discuss the word with another person (after attempting some of the above strategies).

[^1]: Some of the prompts will not be appropriate for the text students are reading. Invite students to choose a prompt that works for the text they have just read.
