**Hidden Figures in Space Science Picture Book**

Throughout the module, students will have studied the contributions and celebrated the accomplishments of key “hidden figures” in space science, beginning with the titular hidden figures the West Computers at NACA, who serve as the focus of the module’s anchor text—and culminating with other under-recognized hidden figures in space science. In this performance task, students (working in triads) will create and contribute three pages of a class picture book devoted to the stories of hidden figures. Each triad, or crew, will be responsible for three pages of content centered on the focus figure of their research. These individual stories will be compiled into an anthology-style picture book geared toward an elementary-age audience.

Students will use models of narrative nonfiction picture books to determine the key criteria for this genre and incorporate those characteristics into their own pages. To create the content of the text, students will conduct independent research into the individual of their choosing to locate particularly remarkable accomplishments worthy of being shared. Then, students will collaborate within their crew to compose the text for their three-page contribution to the class picture book. Illustrations (hand-drawn sketches or images found online) will accompany each section of text. This performance task intends to uplift the mostly unknown stories of these other hidden figures and distill information about them into simpler language that can be easily shared with younger students so that they, too, may learn about these important figures in space science.

Format

A children’s picture book created from contributions by each crew, whose work will focus on just one of many hidden figures in space science. Students will share duties as authors, illustrators, and editors, designing three pages of content for their class book. Each triad will be responsible for highlighting their individual’s accomplishments in narrative nonfiction text with accompanying illustrations.

Standards Addressed through This Task

The performance tasks at the end of every module are neither formative nor summative assessments. They are not formative since they come at the end of the module, concluding students’ learning about the module topic and the literacy skills they have built over eight or nine weeks. However, they are also not summative because they are heavily scaffolded to help students create high-quality work, and so are not a strong measure of what students can do independently. For these reasons, we do not recommend analyzing performance tasks with the same lens used to analyze assessments. Consider looking at students’ performance tasks through the lens of the attributes of high-quality student work (authenticity, complexity, and craftsmanship).

Below are possible questions to keep in mind when considering these attributes:

- **Authenticity:** Were the students careful to conduct accurate research from credible sources and to paraphrase their findings responsibly? Did students internalize the roles of author, illustrator, and editor, understanding the connection between their work and the tasks of those who work in these occupations? Does student work reflect an understanding of the need to lift up the stories of those who have historically gone unrecognized?

- **Complexity:** Did the students carefully consider what accomplishments are most important to share with their audience? Do the text and illustrations reveal an understanding of the abilities and interests of an elementary-age audience? Do students use thoughtful, precise, and appropriate vocabulary and grammatical structures to convey their ideas?

- **Craftsmanship:** Is the text carefully crafted to appeal to a younger audience? Are the characteristics of narrative nonfiction present in the writing? Is the text edited for conventions and aesthetics and presented in a professional manner? Are the illustrations carefully drawn or culled from online sources to accurately and meaningfully reflect the events described in the text? Did the students draw from the criteria for an effective children’s picture book to create a book worthy of publication in the school library? During class presentations, did the students appropriately adjust their language (i.e., their wording, volume, and intonation) to share their work with a larger audience?

The following standards are addressed, but not assessed:

- **RI.6.1:** Cite textual evidence to support analysis of what the text says explicitly as well as inferences drawn from the text.

- **W.6.3:** Write narratives to develop real or imagined experiences or events using effective technique, relevant descriptive details, and well-structured event sequences.

- **W.6.4:** Produce clear and coherent writing in which the development, organization, and style are appropriate to task, purpose, and audience. (Grade-specific expectations for writing types are defined in standards 1–3 above.)

- **W.6.5:** With some guidance and support from peers and adults, develop and strengthen writing as needed by planning, revising, editing, rewriting, or trying a new approach. (Editing for conventions should demonstrate command of Language standards 1–3 up to and including grade 6.)

- **W.6.7:** Conduct short research projects to answer a question, drawing on several sources and refocusing the inquiry when appropriate.

- **W.6.10:** Write routinely over extended time frames (time for research, reflection, and revision) and shorter time frames (a single sitting or a day or two) for a range of discipline-specific tasks, purposes, and audiences.

- **SL.6.1:** Engage effectively in a range of collaborative discussions (one-on-one, in groups, and teacher-led) with diverse partners on grade 6 topics, texts, and issues, building on others’ ideas and expressing their own clearly.

- **SL.6.3:** Delineate a speaker’s argument and specific claims, distinguishing claims that are supported by reasons and evidence from claims that are not.

- **SL.6.4:** Present claims and findings, sequencing ideas logically and using pertinent descriptions, facts, and details to accentuate main ideas or themes; use appropriate eye contact, adequate volume, and clear pronunciation.

- **SL.6.5:** Include multimedia components (e.g., graphics, images, music, sound) and visual displays in presentations to clarify information.

- **SL.6.6:** Adapt speech to a variety of contexts and tasks, demonstrating command of formal English when indicated or appropriate. (See grade 6 Language standards 1 and 3 for specific expectations.)

- **L.6.3:** Use knowledge of language and its conventions when writing, speaking, reading, or listening.

- **L.6.6:** Acquire and use accurately grade-appropriate general academic and domain-specific words and phrases; gather vocabulary knowledge when considering a word or phrase important to comprehension or expression.

Student-Friendly Writing Invitation/Task Description

Houston, we have a problem. A problem with individuals not getting the credit they deserve for their remarkable accomplishments. Throughout this module, you have discovered that despite the contributions of many, sometimes only a few key individuals get recognition for incredible achievements, such as landing humans on the moon. For this performance task, you will research other stars of space science who have been underrepresented, just as Margot Lee Shetterly did in *Hidden Figures*. In small crews of three, you and your peers will write and illustrate one section of a children’s picture book, focusing your section on just one of many “hidden figures” in the field of space science. Your story should reflect the factual information you discover during your research but be written to appeal to a young audience. Compile your section with those written by your fellow crewmates to make one stellar picture book to be shared with elementary Earthlings.

**Mission Objectives**

1.  In crews of three, choose a focus figure, and conduct research on this individual’s remarkable contributions to space science.

2.  Determine which accomplishments should be highlighted, keeping in mind that each crew will be responsible for three pages of content.

3.  Collaborate on the completion of the narrative nonfiction picture book, sharing duties as authors, illustrators, and editors with the rest of your crew.

4.  Present your crew’s pages of the picture book to the class, explaining why these particular achievements were highlighted.

5.  Compile your story into a class anthology to be shared with the school community.

Below are key criteria students need to address when completing this task. Specific lessons during the module build in opportunities for students to understand the criteria, offer additional criteria, and work with their teacher to construct a criteria list by which their work will be critiqued and formally assessed.

Your contribution to the picture book will include the following:

- research conducted on an unsung focus figure in the field of space science chosen from the provided list of options,

- the story of this individual’s remarkable accomplishments described in a text that incorporates the characteristics of effective narrative nonfiction writing,

- relevant and thoughtful illustrations (hand-drawn or computer-generated) to accompany the text, and

- a presentation of your crew’s contribution to the class book.

Options for Students

- Expand learning outside of space science. Research hidden figures in other fields, such as music or math, and come up with other creative ways to share their stories.

- Look for the hidden figures within your school community. Whose efforts at school often go unnoticed? Custodians? Secretaries? Honor them in a public way that highlights their contributions.

- Reflect on your learning across the four modules. Consider places where the learning in the different modules overlapped. What themes emerged in more than one module? What connections can you make between this performance task and others, such as the audio museum in Module 3? Engage in a reflective class discussion about the lessons that resonated most during this school year.

Options for Teachers

- Module 4 Unit 3 lessons take into account widely varying technological resources in classrooms. Explore options carefully, and choose what is best for aiding students in creating their texts and illustrations. Maintain the focus on uncovering the contributions of hidden figures rather than on comparing artistic talents amongst students. Direct students to online sources for free, high-quality images if they are hesitant about their ability to create original drawings.

- The picture book could also be created using an online resource. This may aid the collaborative process, allowing students to work from home, and may make it easier to keep track of materials.

- Donate the completed picture book to the school library to extend learning to the rest of the school community.

- Arrange to have the sixth-grade students partner with students in a lower grade for a shared reading experience of the completed picture book.

- Besides presenting their final product to their classmates, consider inviting parents or other adults in the school community to share in the celebration of their completed picture books.

- Leverage local resources by inviting an actual author, illustrator, or editor into the classroom to speak with the students about the tasks and responsibilities associated with their profession.
