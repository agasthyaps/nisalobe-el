**Hidden Figures in Space Science Picture Book**

**Task**

Create a picture book intended for an elementary-age audience that highlights the remarkable contributions of those who have gone unrecognized in the field of space science. Students will work in triads, or “crews,” and each crew will be responsible for three pages of an anthology featuring a number of hidden figures who deserve to have their achievements celebrated.

**Your contribution to the children’s picture book will include**

- research conducted on an unsung focus figure in the field of space science chosen from the provided list of options,

- the story of this individual’s remarkable accomplishments described in a text that incorporates the characteristics of effective narrative nonfiction writing,

- relevant and thoughtful illustrations (hand-drawn or computer-generated) to accompany the text, and

- a presentation of your crew’s contribution to the class book.

  **Purpose**

Our study of history is most accurate when we celebrate the contributions of all involved. By uncovering the stories of hidden figures and sharing them with a wider audience in the form of a picture book, we contribute to a better world in which everyone gets the recognition they deserve.
