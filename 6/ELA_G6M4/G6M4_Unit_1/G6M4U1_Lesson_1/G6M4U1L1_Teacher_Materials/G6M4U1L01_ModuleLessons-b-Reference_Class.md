“It is a most important decision that we make as a nation. But all of you have lived through the last four years and have seen the significance of space and the adventures in space, and no one can predict with certainty what the ultimate meaning will be of mastery of space.”

“In the early 1940s, the United States government spread the word far and wide that it was hiring. Bulletins listing civil service jobs—nonmilitary government jobs—plastered the walls at local post offices. And it was on a trip to the Farmville post office during the spring of 1943 that Dorothy saw a notice for the laundry job at Camp Pickett. But as she glanced over the other bulletins, the word ‘mathematics’ caught her eye. She looked more closely and learned that a federal agency in Hampton, Virginia was looking for women to fill a number of mathematical jobs at a facility specializing in the development of airplanes.

“Dorothy assumed the bulletin was meant for the eyes of the white, well-to-do students at the all-female State Teachers College in Farmville. It never occurred to her that the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory would accept an application from an African-American woman.”

“Mary began work as a computer at Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory in 1951. She worked in a supersonic wind tunnel, studying the impact of wind forces that were nearly twice the speed of sound. In order to be promoted to engineer, she needed to take graduate-level courses in physics and math. She had to petition the City of Hampton, Virginia, for permission to attend the classes because they were held at a whites-only high school. She completed the classes, and in 1958 she became the first female African-American aerospace engineer at NASA.”

“The next adventure wouldn’t be easy and would require lots of tests and lots more numbers. But Dorothy, Mary, Katherine, and Christine knew one thing: with hard work, perseverance, and a love of math, anything was possible.”

“America’s landing on the moon is one of the miracles of the ages. Few instances in the chronicles of man, at their time, were as significant. It is a truly remarkable feat and for that success I congratulate this country. Taken at face value, it would seem that all Americans would rejoice at such a monumental occurrence. I do not. The high priority that this country has put on landing on the moon and exploring outer space in the face of deplorable human suffering in this nation and throughout the world again asserts the fact that mechanical values supersede human values in this country . . . can’t these people see just how unhuman, how unjust, how criminal it is to spend \$24 billion dollars for space exploration and to dribble out sparse thousands to improve the human predicament down here on the ground.”
