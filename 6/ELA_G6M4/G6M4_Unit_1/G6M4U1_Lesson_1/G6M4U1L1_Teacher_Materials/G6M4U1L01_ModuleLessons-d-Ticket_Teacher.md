Responses will vary, but may include: The term *accomplishments* makes me think of something that a person has achieved. It has the connotation of being an amazing thing, something to be proud of, something that was done against the odds. *Successes* is a similar word, but it is less connected to the idea of people. A business or an organization might experience successes, but a person would experience an accomplishment. The word *great* makes it sound like the achievement is nice but not overly impressive. The word *remarkable* makes it sound like the achievement is especially important and worth talking about.
