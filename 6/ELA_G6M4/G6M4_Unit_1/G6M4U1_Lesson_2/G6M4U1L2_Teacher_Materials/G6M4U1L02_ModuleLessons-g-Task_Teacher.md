W.6.10

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Write continuously to answer the given prompt: How do the two texts we read in this lesson (“The Space Race” and the excerpt from President Kennedy’s speech to Congress) add to our understanding of the module topic? Hint: Refer to the Module Guiding Questions anchor chart to spark ideas.

Responses will vary, but may include: These two articles help to answer one of the module guiding questions: “What was the Apollo 11 mission, and in what scientific, political, and social context did it take place?” The article provides background knowledge about the time period, specifically about the political context. It explains that there was heated competition between the United States and Russia at the time. It also explains some of the scientific context. Russia had managed to launch Sputnik into orbit and, soon after, America launched the Explorer 1 satellite. All of these scientific advancements were steps toward being able to put a person on the moon. The Kennedy speech adds more information about the politics at the time. It shows that joining the Space Race, which led to the Apollo 11 mission, was motivated by a desire to compete with the Soviet Union and was led by the support of the President and Congress.
