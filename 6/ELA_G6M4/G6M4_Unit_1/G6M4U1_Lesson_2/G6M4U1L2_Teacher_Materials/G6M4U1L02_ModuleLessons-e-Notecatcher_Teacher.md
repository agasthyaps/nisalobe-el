**Directions:** Listen to the excerpt from President John F. Kennedy’s “Special Message to the Congress on Urgent National Needs,” delivered on May 1961. Then, reread the text and respond to the questions with details from the speech.

1.  What are the key ideas in the excerpt?

JFK believes that taking the lead in space achievement is “the key to our future on earth.”

The United States has the talent and resources for space travel but has never committed to the goal before.

The Soviets have a “head start.” US citizens and Congress should consider carefully if going to the moon is the right call.

Taking on this task would mean diverting resources, like money, from other causes.

2.  What point of view toward space travel is being conveyed in the speech excerpt? What details does Kennedy include to support his point of view?

JFK’s point of view toward space travel is that it is a worthy and necessary cause. He says, “We go into space because whatever mankind must undertake, free men must fully share . . . .” He calls it “a great new American enterprise.” He also states outright, “I believe we should go to the moon.”

3.  Choose a word with a strong connotation. Explain how the word’s connotation reveals the speaker’s point of view.

*Exciting* and *adventure* both have positive connotations. Both convey a sense of anticipation, of doing something meaningful and worthwhile. These words support JFK’s point of view that space travel is a worthy and necessary undertaking.
