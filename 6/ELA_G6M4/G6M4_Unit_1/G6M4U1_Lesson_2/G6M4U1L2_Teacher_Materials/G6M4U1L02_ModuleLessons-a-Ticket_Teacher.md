(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, read the learning targets. Then read this excerpt from President Kennedy’s speech at Rice University in 1962.

Notice that as the reader read through the text, they added notes in the margin (the space to the left of the text). Based on the text and the notes, answer the questions below.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>“There is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as yet. Its hazards are hostile to us all. Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind, and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation may never come again. But why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask why climb the highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? . . .</p>
<p>We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.</p>
<p>It is for these reasons that I regard the decision last year to shift our efforts in space from low to high gear as among the most important decisions that will be made during my incumbency in the office of the Presidency.”</p></td>
<td><blockquote>
<p>Context: said during the Cold War, Kennedy wants to work together internationally</p>
<p>I’ve heard this before. Famous line?</p>
<p>Seems to be the central idea</p>
<p>Phrase conveys a sense of urgency<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What does this word mean?</p>

Responses will vary, but may include: The reader might have added these notes to help them stay focused and pull out the most important ideas from the text. The notes show the reader’s thinking, which will help as the reader continues to work with the text either to discuss it, write about it, or answer questions about it.
