**Sentence**

The compact-car-size space capsule **would be greeted and surrounded by searing white-hot flames** as it slammed madly back down to Earth. (from paragraph 4 of *Team Moon* by Catherine Thimmesh)

Launch

This Language Dive builds on the point-of-view work of the previous lesson’s Mini Language Dive. If productive, invite students to review and summarize with a partner what they learned about how Buzz Aldrin’s point of view was conveyed in the Mini Language Dive sentence.

The compact-car-size space capsule

Deconstruct

- **compact-car-size**

“What part of speech is this hyphenated compound word? How do you know?” (Even though two of its three individual words are nouns, this hyphenated compound word is an adjective because it is describing the noun space capsule.)

“How does the word compact-car-size help us better imagine the size of the command module?” (The word compact-car-size gives us a point of comparison. We know the approximate size of a compact car, and this helps us picture the space capsule.)

- Students can sketch this chunk on their note-catchers to reinforce their understanding of the space capsule’s size. Sketches might include separate drawings of a car and a space capsule; alternatively, students might want to combine these images into a single hybrid sketch!  Step 3

would be greeted and surrounded by searing white-hot flames

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- **searing white-hot flames**

“What do the adjectives searing and white-hot mean in this chunk? How do you know? Close your eyes and imagine the capsule surrounded by searing white-hot flames.” (These adjectives both mean very, very hot. Students may know the meaning as a result of their background knowledge or from deconstructing the context \[i.e., these are adjectives describing the noun flames.\])

“What is the impact of using these adjectives instead of an adjective with a similar denotation, like hot?” (Responses will vary, but may include: these adjectives indicate a stronger or more intense heat.)

“What do these adjectives suggest about the author’s point of view toward the return mission of Apollo 11?” (These adjectives suggest that the author thinks this is a very dangerous mission.)

- **be greeted and surrounded by**

“In what contexts do you usually hear or use the verb greet? Does this verb generally have a positive or negative connotation?” (Responses will vary, but may include: The verb greet is generally used in contexts where someone is saying hello to another person in a friendly or welcoming way. This verb generally has a positive connotation.)

“What is the effect of using a word with a positive connotation in a sentence describing a negative event?” (Responses will vary, but may include: This combination of language feels ironic and unexpected. The mismatch of the verb greet and the events of the sentence emphasizes the idea that returning home after a trip to the moon might not be as pleasant as one would expect.)

- **would**

“Can you figure out what would means in this sentence?” (It is the past tense of the modal will. It is describing a future event, but from the perspective of the past.)

“When we write about the past, we can use would in front of a verb to signal to our audience that an event took place after the period of time that we’re writing about. Would tells the reader that an event took place in the past, but that at the time of the other events in a text, it was still in the future.”

- Consider providing examples of the word **would** in context to support students’ understanding of the word and to help students differentiate this use from other uses they may be familiar with (e.g., **would** to signal the conditional mood). Some examples may include the ones listed below:

- By the end of the book, the character **would** experience many challenges.

- If I were an astronaut, I **would** want to go to the moon.

- Students can examine the two sentences and reflect on the different uses of the word **would**.

- **  
  Students can use Conversation Cues as they discuss. To provide heavier support, display a suggested sequence, such as the one below:**

- Let’s take time to think and write or sketch. (Goal 1)

- Can you give an example? (Goal 2)

- Who can repeat what your classmate said in your own words? (Goal 3)

- What strategies helped you figure out the meaning of **would**? (Goal 4)

Practice (Focus Structure)

- **In fifth grade, the students learned about earthquakes and hurricanes. In sixth grade, they would \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**  Step 4

- Students can explore an example sentence to help them make sense of this use of **would**: **on the first day of sixth grade, the students would begin reading *The Lightning Thief*.** Students can use the grid on their note-catchers to track the chronology of the events they include in their sentence.  Step 5

- To provide lighter support: “Can you explain the purpose and function of the modal **would** using your own words?”

- To provide heavier support: Offer sample answers from which students can select an appropriate response. Invite students to sketch the sentence they produce. Some sample answers may include: “On the first day of sixth grade, the students would look around for a friend in class” or “On the first day of sixth grade, the students would line up outside a new classroom and meet their teacher.”

as it slammed madly back down to Earth.

Deconstruct

- Ask:

“Which words in this chunk further support the author’s point of view that Apollo 11’s return to Earth would be very dangerous? Explain your answer.” (Slammed and madly both emphasize the idea that returning to Earth would be dangerous. The verb slammed suggests a strong impact, and the adverb madly suggests that the capsule would be out of control.)

The compact-car-size space capsule would be greeted and surrounded by searing white-hot flames as it slammed madly back down to Earth.

Reconstruct

Ask:

“What if we rewrote this sentence in the past simple without the modal would? How would the meaning and perspective of the sentence change?” (The new sentence would be “The compact-car-size space capsule was greeted and surrounded by searing white-hot flames as it slammed madly back down to Earth.” This new sentence suggests that this event has already taken place, and the author is reflecting on it in the past. The original sentence was describing something that did happen eventually, but had not yet occurred in the timeline of the article.)

“What do you think was the author’s purpose in including this information about the dangers of Apollo 11’s return to Earth?” (Responses will vary, but may include that the author wanted to remind readers how dangerous this mission was as a way to emphasize how amazing Apollo 11 was, how crazy it was, or how serious it was.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the Daily Learning Target, I can analyze the author’s point of view and purpose and how they are conveyed in the Team Moon text?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice (Sentence)

- Students can complete the frame to illustrate the likely point of view of the Apollo 11 astronauts toward their upcoming mission before the launch. Students can draw from their background knowledge, from past in-class readings, or from their imaginations to complete the frame. Students should use vivid adjectives and verbs to convey the astronauts’ point of view.

> **The night before the launch, the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ astronauts would \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**
>
> (The night before the launch, the well-prepared astronauts would gaze at the sky and imagine themselves in the stars.)  Step 6

- To provide lighter support: invite students to write multiple versions of the sentence to encapsulate different points of view toward the Apollo 11 mission (e.g., fear, awe, patriotism).

- To provide heavier support: invite students to discuss ideas in their home languages first before completing the sentence frame in English.
