**Directions:** Read the quote by astronaut Michael Collins, who, along with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, was part of the Apollo 11 mission to send human beings to the moon for the first time. After you read the quote, answer the questions. Refer to the provided glossary as necessary.

“I really believe that if the political leaders of the world could see their planet from a distance of 100,000 miles their outlook could be fundamentally changed. That all-important border would be invisible, that noisy argument silenced. The tiny globe would continue to turn, serenely ignoring its subdivisions, presenting a unified façade that would cry out for unified understanding, for homogeneous treatment. The earth must become as it appears: blue and white, not capitalist or Communist; blue and white, not rich or poor; blue and white, not envious or envied. Small, shiny, serene, blue and white, FRAGILE.”
