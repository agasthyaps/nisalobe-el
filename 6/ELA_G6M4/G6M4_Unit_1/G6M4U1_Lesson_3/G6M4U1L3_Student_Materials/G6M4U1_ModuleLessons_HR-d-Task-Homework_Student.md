Homework: Apollo Missions

**Name:** **Date:**

**Directions:** Read the passages about three of the missions in the Apollo program. Add annotations below each mission paragraph, calling attention to key details, unfamiliar vocabulary, connections to prior knowledge, and any other important notices or wonderings you have. Update the Timeline of Space Race Events (homework from Unit 1, Lesson 2) with the new information you have learned from these passages.

**Apollo 8 – December 21, 1968**

Apollo 8 was the first manned mission to reach the moon, orbit it, and return safely to Earth. During this mission, astronaut William Anders captured the now famous photograph, *Earthrise*, looking back at Earth from the lunar orbit. Apollo 8 achieved many firsts. It was the first manned spacecraft to escape Earth’s gravity and the first to launch from the new Kennedy Space Center. Apollo 8 also provided the first televised images of the moon’s surface.

**Apollo 10 – May 18, 1969**

Apollo 10 served as a dress rehearsal for the actual moon landing. Its mission was to simulate all aspects of the Apollo 11 mission. This included descending in the Lunar Module down to within fourteen kilometers of the moon’s surface without actually landing. The Lunar Module was named *Snoopy* after the famous character from the *Peanuts* comic strip. Its job was to “snoop” around the lunar surface gathering data about the Apollo 11 landing site. The Lunar Module would deploy from the Command Module named *Charlie Brown*, named after Snoopy’s faithful companion in the comics. Additionally, Apollo 10 was the second spacecraft to orbit the moon and the first to film their travels in color, which were then televised back on Earth.

**Apollo 11 – July 16, 1969**

Apollo 11 was the first manned mission to land on the moon. Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin successfully descended to the surface of the moon while crewmate Michael Collins remained in orbit in the Command Module. The first human to set foot on another planetary body, Armstrong fulfilled President Kennedy’s promise to land man on the moon before the end of the decade. After disembarking from the Lunar Module, named *Eagle*, Armstrong and Aldrin spent over twenty-one hours on the moon. They photographed the lunar terrain and gathered samples from the moon’s surface to bring back to Earth. They left behind the flag of the United States planted in the moon’s surface and a plaque. The plaque read: “Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon, July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind.” The three astronauts returned safely to Earth as heroes.
