Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Work Time A: Students complete the End of Unit 1 Assessment. They read the opinion article “An Argument against the Moon Mission.” Students answer constructed response questions about the author’s point of view and how it is conveyed in the text. They also trace the author’s argument, identifying a claim, reasons, evidence, and reasoning. (RI.6.1, RI.6.4, RI.6.6, RI.6.8)

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners by reading and answering questions independently for the assessment. Prompt students’ perseverance by reminding them that assessments are meant to inform instruction. Use assessment data to make choices about what should be retaught and how to adjust the pacing. Encourage students not to be afraid of making mistakes; an accurate assessment is crucial for tailoring lessons to students’ needs.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Some students may not need extensive review of the assessment directions. Release them to begin working on the assessment while clarification is provided to other students who need more support.

- Students who finish the assessment early should continue with their independent research reading.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the second half of this unit, students read excerpts of informational texts and primary source documents, building background knowledge about the Space Race and analyzing the author’s point of view and use of connotative and figurative language. This lesson continues those routines in an assessment, asking students to apply their learning to a new informational text.

Support All Students

- As with any assessment, students may feel nervous to read new passages independently and answer questions about them. Point out all the preparation they have had through activities, homework, and in-class reading time. Also, remind them there will be other opportunities throughout Module 4 to demonstrate what they have learned.

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment.

- Some students may need the text read aloud before they work on the questions. Invite these students to sit in a group away from the rest of the students, so as not to be distracting.

- For some students, this assessment may require more than the 35 minutes allotted. Provide time over multiple days if necessary.

- An opportunity to track their progress after the assessment helps students reflect on and celebrate their growth.

- To support ELLs, this lesson invites students to complete assessment tasks similar to the classroom tasks in Lessons 5–6. Students read a new text, “An Argument against the Moon Mission,” which criticizes the moon landing and poses the argument that the United States should prioritize taking care of people on Earth before sending astronauts to the moon. Students answer selected response questions about the main claim, reasons, and evidence presented in the text, as well as about the point of view of the author.

- ELLs may find it challenging to deconstruct and interpret the argument structure of the assessment text. Because this is a short unit, students may feel worried that they did not have enough time to practice analyzing arguments between the mid-unit and end of unit assessments. Remind them of all their Module 3 work analyzing and developing literary arguments, which have a similar structure and use identical terminology (e.g., *main claim*, *reasons*, *evidence*, and *reasoning*).

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.7, 6.I.B.8, 6.II.A.1, 6.II.A.2, and 6.II.C.6.

Assessment Guidance

- All assessment materials for End of Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Point of View and Argument are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback on this assessment, use the answer key and sample student responses (see Assessment Overview and Resources) to help complete students’ Track Progress recording form.

- Using information from this assessment, students are tracking progress toward anchor standards:

- R.1: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.

- R.4: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Interpret words and phrases as they are used in a text, including determining technical, connotative, and figurative meanings, and analyze how specific word choices shape meaning or tone.

- R.10: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Read and comprehend complex literary and informational texts independently and proficiently.

Down the Road

- The next lesson launches Unit 2. Students are introduced to the anchor text, *Hidden Figures (Young Readers’ Edition)*, and begin to build their understanding of the other players who were key to the success of the Apollo 11 mission by reading the prologue and chapter 1 of the text and determining the author’s purpose for writing the book.

- Students’ End of Unit 1 Assessments will be returned in Unit 2, Lesson 7 with feedback.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare End of Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Point of View and Argument: “An Argument against the Moon Mission” (see Assessment Overview and Resources).

- Ensure feedback from the Module 4 Mid-Unit 1 Assessment is ready for Opening A.

- Review the student tasks and example answers to get familiar with what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Prepare copies of handouts for students, including entrance ticket (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous modules to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.6.10 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as in previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 8**. Students will also need their **Module 4 Mid-Unit 1 Assessment with feedback**.

- Once all students are ready, invite them to share their stars and steps with a partner. Remind students that everyone is working toward individual goals and that learning is about continued growth and development.

- Repeated routine: follow the same routine as in previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

Work Time

A. End of Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Point of View and Argument (35 minutes)

- Distribute **End of Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Point of View and Argument: “An Argument against the Moon Mission.”**

- Tell students that for this assessment, they will read a new text, “An Argument against the Moon Mission.” In this assessment, students trace and evaluate the author’s argument, identifying the claim, reasons, evidence, and reasoning.

- Review the learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can trace and evaluate the argument in the text ‘An Argument against the Moon Mission.’”

“I can analyze an author’s point of view and how it is conveyed in the text ‘An Argument against the Moon Mission.’”

- Read the directions for each part of the assessment aloud as students follow along, reading silently. Ensure students understand the directions; paraphrase some instructions, if needed. ▲ Answer students’ questions, but refrain from supplying answers to the assessment questions themselves.

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence. Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**, and review what perseverance looks and sounds like. Remind students that because they will be reading and answering questions independently for the assessment, they may need to practice perseverance.

- Invite students to begin the assessment.

- While they are taking the assessment, circulate to monitor and document their test-taking skills.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Heavier Support

- Display a “map” of the assessment to reference while explaining directions to the end of unit assessment. This will reduce ambiguity and give students a clearer picture of what they can expect so that they can better allocate their time and attentional resources. Provide students with colored pencils or highlighters so that they can mark up the “map” as needed. An example is given below:

- Read “An Argument against the Moon Mission.” Then,

- Evaluate a list of claims, and determine whether they are made in the text and/or whether they are supported by reasons and evidence.

- Determine the main claim of the text, and locate the paragraph in which the author introduces it.

- Identify the reasons and evidence that the author uses to support the main claim.

- Identify the author’s point of view toward the Apollo 11 mission, and identify evidence that conveys that point of view.

Closing and Assessment

A. Track Progress – RI.6.1 (5 minutes)

- Give students specific, positive feedback on their completion of the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment.

- Distribute **Track Progress folders; Track Progress: Read, Understand, and Explain New Text; Writing Record;** and **sticky notes**.

- Tell students the sticky notes are for them to find evidence of the following criteria:

- RI.6.1

- RI.6.4, L.6.4

- Guide students through completing the form. Encourage students to orally paraphrase the meaning of the Track Progress criteria, self-assess, and discuss the evidence with a partner before they begin writing. Direct students to complete their **Writing Record** for the writing they did as part of the End of Unit 1 Assessment.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their habit of character focus for this lesson.

For Lighter Support

- In preparation for the next unit, invite students who need lighter support to revisit the module topic: Remarkable Accomplishments in Space Science. Students can make predictions about the content of Units 2 and 3. Encourage students to use newly acquired domain-specific vocabulary when articulating their predictions.

For Heavier Support
