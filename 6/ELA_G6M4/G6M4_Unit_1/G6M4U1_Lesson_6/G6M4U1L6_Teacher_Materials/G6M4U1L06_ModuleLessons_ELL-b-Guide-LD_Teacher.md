5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

RI.6.1, RI.6.4, RI.6.6, RI.6.8, SL.6.1

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

In the face of such suffering, **he asserted that space flight represented an inhuman priority.** (from paragraph 2 of *The Space Shuttle Decision* excerpt by T. A. Heppenheimer)

**Lesson 6 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after students read and analyze the excerpt of *The Space Shuttle Decision* during Work Time B.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target (**I can analyze the author’s point of view in *The Space Shuttle Decision* and how it is conveyed in the text**) and RI.6.4 and RI.6.6 by including strong vocabulary with specific connotations to express the point of view of a key figure. The sentence also helps students to address RI.6.8 by presenting an argument against space flight. Supporting standards: RI.6.1, SL.6.1.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses words with specific connotations (e.g., **suffering**, **inhuman**, **asserted**) to support an argument. It also uses a prepositional phrase (**In the face of such suffering**) to introduce the sentence and provide context.

- Transfer: Words with precise connotations and academic reporting language (e.g., **asserted**) to accurately present the claims of others when tracing and evaluating claims in argument essays throughout the module.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **In the face of such suffering, <u>he asserted that space flight represented an inhuman priority.</u>**

- Ask:

“What is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses, but look for students to notice that this sentence presents someone’s opinion about space travel.)

“Whom is the pronoun he referring to in this sentence?” (He refers to civil rights leader Ralph Abernathy.)

“Based on the excerpt you just read in class, what do you know about Ralph Abernathy?” (Responses will vary, but may include: He was a civil rights leader. He was president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference after Martin Luther King Jr. was killed.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **he asserted that space flight represented an inhuman priority.**

- Draw students’ attention to the word **inhuman,** and display its definition: cruel; showing no interest in people or their feelings.

“Based on its denotation, does the word inhuman have a positive or negative connotation?” (It has a very negative connotation.)

“How do the affix in- and the root human relate to the definition of this word?”  
(In- means not or no. Inhuman doesn’t mean not human, but it does mean against or without care for humans.)

- Draw students’ attention to the word **priority**. If needed, explain that a priority is something that is more important than other things and is going to be addressed first.

“What would make a priority inhuman?” (Answers will vary, but may include that a priority would be inhuman if it were based on cruelty or if it did not take human needs or feelings into account.)

“What does the phrase an inhuman priority indicate about Abernathy’s point of view toward space travel?” (This phrase indicates that Abernathy strongly disagrees with making space travel the most important national goal. He thinks it is cruel to do so because the basic needs of the people on Earth are being ignored.)

“How is Abernathy’s point of view toward space travel different from, say, Buzz Aldrin’s point of view, which we analyzed earlier in the unit?” (Whereas Abernathy believes that it is wrong to go to space because we have other problems that need attention first, Buzz is very excited about the idea of space travel.)

“Based on the rest of The Space Shuttle Decision excerpt that we read in class, what national priorities does Abernathy consider more important?” (Abernathy believes that the nation should prioritize social problems like hunger, poverty, and homelessness.)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **In the face of such suffering, <u>he asserted that space flight represented an inhuman priority.</u>**

- Ask:

“How does the phrase In the face of such suffering add context to this sentence?” (It clarifies why Abernathy believes it is wrong to prioritize space flight \[i.e., because people are suffering\].)

“If this were the main claim in an argument essay, what would you expect to follow this sentence in the essay? Hint: Think about your Module 3 literary argument essays.” (Responses will vary, but may include: clear reasons to support the argument; evidence to support the reasons; and reasoning drawn from the evidence.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target  
I can analyze the author’s point of view in The Space Shuttle Decision and how it is conveyed in the text?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

> **Space flight \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ because \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

predicate independent clause

- Say:

“Use this frame to rewrite the Language Dive sentence as a main claim that you might find in an argument essay. Preserve the meaning of the original sentence, even if you personally disagree with it. Elaborate on the claim by providing a reason. Use your own words and work with your partners.”

- Responses will vary, but may include:

> **Space flight <u>should not be a national priority</u> because <u>many people on *this* planet are hungry and in pain</u>.**
