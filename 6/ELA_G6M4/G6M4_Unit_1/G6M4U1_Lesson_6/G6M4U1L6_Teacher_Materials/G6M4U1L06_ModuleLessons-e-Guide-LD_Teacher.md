(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

One thing is for sure though—if there had been no Space Race, then surely the world of space research and space missions **would be quite different from what it is today.** (from paragraph 14 of “This Is How the Space Race Changed the Great Rivalry Forever” by Martand Jha)

Launch

This Language Dive revisits the past perfect verb tense, which students first examined in Grade 5 (L.5.1b). If productive, consider inviting students to recall what they remember about the past perfect (e.g., its form or its use) before beginning the Language Dive.

One thing is for sure though—

Deconstruct

- Ask:

“Can you figure out why the writer began the sentence this way? What was his purpose?” (The author wanted to emphasize that something is definitely true. He wanted to remove any doubts the reader might have about the truthfulness of the sentence. \[independent clause\])

“What does the meanings of the adverb though suggest about what came before this sentence in the text?” (Responses will vary, but may include: The adverb though usually signals a contrast. This suggests that what came before this sentence might have been speculation. If the author is sure about his statement in this sentence, though tells the readers that may he may have been less sure about his previous statements.)

- Draw students’ attention to the dash at the end of the chunk. If productive, to activate prior knowledge, ask, “How have you seen dashes used in texts?”

“What does the dash at the end of the sentence tell us about what will follow?” (Responses will vary, but may include: the dash tells us that more information will follow; it introduces the next clause; it prepares the reader for an important conclusion.)

if there had been no Space Race,

Deconstruct

- **if**

“What does the word if tell us about the information in this chunk?” (Responses will vary, but may include: The word if tells us that the information in the chunk will be speculation. The chunk will ask the reader to imagine something that has not or did not happen.)

- **had been**

“What verb tense is had been?” (past perfect)

- Remind students that they studied perfect verb forms in Grade 5.

“With this sentence, what is the writer implicitly asking the reader to do?” (The writer is asking the reader to imagine that the Space Race had never occurred.)

“How would the meaning of this chunk change if it were written as, if there were no Space Race? (Because of this change in meaning, why is the past perfect an appropriate grammatical choice for this sentence?” If the chunk were written as if there were no Space Race, it would mean that the Space Race was happening currently. The past perfect is an appropriate grammatical choice because it allows us to imagine events in the past, like the Space Race.)

- If time allows, invite students to speculate aloud in pairs what might be different if there had been no Space Race.

then surely the world of space research and space missions

Deconstruct

- **the world of space research and space missions**

“What nouns do you see in this chunk? Underline them in blue.” (world, space, research, missions)

“What kinds of things is the author referring to with this noun phrase? What is included in the world of space research and space missions?” (Responses will vary, but may include that the author is referring to programs like NASA or missions like Apollo 11.)

would be quite different from what it is today.

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- **would be quite different**

“What does the word would tell us about this sentence?” (Responses will vary, but may include: It tells us that this sentence is written using the conditional mood. It tells us to imagine a different result or effect than what actually occurred.)

“According to the text, what would be different about the world of space research and space missions if there had been no Space Race?” (Responses will vary, but may include: space research would have received less attention and space missions would have received less funding; other countries, like India, would have less developed space programs; there may have been more problems between the United States and the USSR.)

- Display the following sentence, alongside the Language Dive sentence: **If there had been no Space Race, then surely the world of space research and space missions would have received less attention.**

“What do you notice about the difference between the form of this sentence and the form of the Language Dive sentence?” (This sentence includes the construction would have received, whereas the Language Dive sentence has would be.)

“What does this difference in form tell you about the difference in meaning?” (The Language Dive sentence describes an imaginary circumstance in the past. This is the past unreal conditional. The second sentence describes an imaginary circumstance that could be, but isn’t, taking place now. This is the present conditional.)

- Students may need additional examples or support as they interpret the differences in form and meaning between these two sentences. Tell students that they will be exploring the conditional mood in more detail in Grade 8 (L.8.1c), so it is okay if they don’t fully understand these concepts now. Congratulate them on their hard work interpreting this chunk!

- **Students can use Conversation Cues as they discuss. To provide heavier support, display a suggested sequence, such as the one below:**

- So, do you mean \_\_\_\_? (Goal 1)

- Can you say more about that? (Goal 1)

- Who can tell us what your classmate said in your own words? (Goal 2)

- Who can add on to what your classmate said? (Goal 4)

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Students can complete the sentence frame to imagine what might be different if the United States had not participated in the Space Race.

- If the United States had not participated in the Space Race, then \_\_\_\_\_\_\_. (If the United States had not participated in the Space Race, then NASA probably would not exist today.)  Step 3

- To provide lighter support: Challenge students to write two versions of this sentence—one that uses the present conditional (i.e., describes something that would be different <u>now</u>) and one that uses the past unreal conditional (i.e., describes something that would be different in the <u>past</u>).

- To provide heavier support: Invite students to discuss the meaning of the sentence in home language groups. Add the nouns in students’ home languages to the Parts of Speech anchor chart.

One thing is for sure though—if there had been no Space Race, then surely the world of space research and space missions would be quite different from what it is today.

Reconstruct

- Ask:

“What words in this sentence do you see used more than once? This includes words written in different forms.” (Space, is, sure/surely)

“Can you figure out why the author chose to use the words sure and surely?” (Responses will vary, but may include: the writer wanted to demonstrate how much he believed in his statement; he wanted to emphasize that what he was saying is true.)

“What other words or phrases could the author have used in this sentence to express certainty about his statement?” (Responses will vary, but may include certain; unquestionably.)

“How does this sentence fit into the structure of the overall article? How does it relate to the rest of the text?” (This sentence is the final sentence in the article. It restates one of the central ideas in the article.)

“Can you repeat the main claim presented in this sentence, using your own words?” (Responses will vary, but may include that the Space Race led to major changes and advancements in the world of space research.)

“What details does the writer use to support this claim in the article?” (Responses will vary, but may include: The competition of the Space Race meant that both the United States and the USSR were trying to do new things for the first time. The Space Race led to the development and launch of artificial satellites. It made human spaceflight possible.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question: What were the main events of the Space Race, and in what scientific, political, and social context did they occur?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to point out that this sentence highlights the scientific impact of the Space Race.)

Practice (Sentence)

- Students can complete the frame below to imagine the impact of a past event that did not take place.

> **If \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ then \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**
>
> (If the United States had spent its space exploration money on social problems, then fewer people would suffer from hunger or homelessness.)  Step 4

- To provide lighter support: In the following lessons, we will read articles that argue against the United States’ participation in the Space Race. These articles assert that the money spent on space exploration could have been used more effectively for people on Earth. Use this frame to produce a main claim that you might see in an essay about this topic. Use your imagination to fill in details that you might not know yet.

- To provide heavier support: provide options to fill in either the first part of the frame (e.g., the astronauts of Apollo 11 had not returned to Earth; Russia had reached the moon first) or the second (e.g., the United States would not have made it to the moon).

Language Chunk Wall Suggestions

- Language to emphasize: **One thing is for sure though—**

- Language to talk about possibility: **if there had been no Space Race; would be quite different from what it is today.**

- Language to talk about cause and effect: **if there had been no Space Race, then surely the world of space research and space missions would be quite different from what it is today.**
