Homework: Evaluate a Claim

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Read the article “Benefits of NASA’s Space Technology on Earth.” Then read each claim in the table that follows, and evaluate how well each claim is supported with evidence in the text.

**“Benefits of NASA’s Space Technology on Earth”**

NASA studies our planet, Sun, solar system and beyond. But America’s space program is closer to home than you may think. You can find thousands of NASA-influenced technologies right in your backyard. These “spinoffs” are products that apply NASA technology originally developed for studying and exploring space. “Our space technology continues to improve life on Earth,” says Jim Reuter, the associate administrator of NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate.

Read below to discover just a few of the common items that NASA inspired or helped improve.

**Water filtration systems in your home date back to the Apollo era.**

Water is a scarce resource away from Earth. A technology originally designed to purify water for the Apollo astronauts is now used to purify water on Earth. In the 1960’s, NASA’s silver ion technology was created to clean and soften water for the astronauts. Silver ions also helped slow bacteria growth in the water filtration units on board the spaceships. Today, this technology is used to create water filtering systems for homes. These systems purify and soften water to be gentler on skin. They also remove foul tastes and odors from the water.

**Durable wind turbines were designed with Mars in mind.**

Solar panels will likely provide the primary source of power for future Mars missions. However, NASA also investigated the use of wind turbines for times when the Sun isn’t shining. Wind turbines that could withstand extreme weather were designed for Mars and tested in Antarctica. These extra tough wind turbines generate power all over the globe today. Wind power can bring the benefit of electricity to remote areas of the world.

**NASA spacesuits and firefighter gear use a similar fabric.**

After the Apollo 1 tragedy, NASA significantly improved an incredibly fire-resistant fabric for use in spacesuits and spacecraft. The material cannot burn or melt and is strong and resistant to tears, chemicals, and mildew. The thermoplastic material can protect people working in the most extreme environments. This includes work with harsh chemicals or in high temperatures. Today it is commonly used in firefighters’ protective gear. NASA also built a lightweight, sturdy breathing system specialized for firefighters. Originally this technology had been developed for astronauts’ life support systems.

**Do you take selfies? NASA technology is in your cell phone camera, too.**

The images NASA captures of distant galaxies or newly discovered stars are often breathtaking—and scientifically groundbreaking. The technology used to capture these images has evolved greatly over the years. In the 1990s a NASA engineer built a new kind of image sensor. It is small, requires very low power, and is highly efficient. Though the sensor is excellent for space missions, it is also used in digital and cell phone cameras on Earth.

**Space tech helps you out on the slopes.**

Skiers and snowboarders face extremely bright sunlight, especially when it’s reflected off the white snow. That can make it hard to see, and not just because of glare. The blue light waves in sunlight make it more difficult to distinguish colors. When colors blend together, a skier may not be able to perceive a sharp drop off or dip in the terrain. A NASA-designed filter used in snow goggles helps block up to 95 percent of blue light. The filter makes it easier for people on the slopes to see the different land formations clearly and, as a result, prevent falls and crashes.

**Directions:** Below are statements that paraphrase possible claims made in the text. Evaluate the extent to which each of the listed claims is made in and supported by reasons and evidence in the text. Write the letter that best evaluates each claim in the table below. You may use the letters more than once.

1.  Claim is made in the text and is supported by reasons and evidence.

2.  Claim is made in the text but is not supported by any reasons or evidence.

3.  Claim is not made in the text.
