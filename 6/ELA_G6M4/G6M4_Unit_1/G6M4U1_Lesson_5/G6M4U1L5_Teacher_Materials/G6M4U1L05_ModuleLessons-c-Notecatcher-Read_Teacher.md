- Why do you think the United Nations had to step in to make the Outer Space Treaty? Why might both the United States and the USSR have decided to go along with it?

Responses will vary, but may include: The world was still recovering from two global wars. The United Nations probably realized that space could easily become another possible battleground and they wanted to set ground rules before things got that serious. The United States and USSR probably agreed because they had been involved in both world wars and did not want to suffer any more losses.

**Culminating Task**

- What is the author’s purpose for writing this article? What words or phrases indicate that purpose?

Responses will vary, but may include: The author’s purpose for writing this article is to persuade the reader that “the Space Race is one of the most iconic moments in the history of mankind.” This is demonstrated by the author’s use of language that clearly shows an opinion or bias. For example, the author uses words and phrases like “tipping point” and “benchmark” to talk about the impact the Space Race had. The author also indicates that “dominance” in space science would require technological and ideological “superiority.” These words have strong connotations which the author chose on purpose to persuade the audience to agree with his point of view toward the topic.
