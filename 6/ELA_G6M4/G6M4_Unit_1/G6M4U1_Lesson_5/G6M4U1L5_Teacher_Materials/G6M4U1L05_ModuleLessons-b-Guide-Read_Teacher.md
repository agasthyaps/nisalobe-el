Close Reading Guide: “This Is How the Space Race Changed the Great Power Rivalry Forever”

RI.6.1, RI.6.2, RI.6.4, RI.6.6

(For Teacher Reference)

**Purpose and Notes**

- The purpose of this close read is for students to determine the author’s point of view toward the Space Race and identify key details that convey that point of view. Using context, affixes, and reference resources, students will determine the meanings of unfamiliar and technical words to understand the impact the Space Race had on the world. Finally, students synthesize their learning to determine the author’s purpose for writing this article. This sets them up to begin their argument analysis of the article in the next lesson.

- Read the text aloud the first time in its entirety. After the first full reading, students will reread portions of the text as they answer text-dependent questions.

- A note-catcher along with text-dependent questions provide an opportunity for students to capture how the author is building the argument.

- Continue to use discussion protocols (e.g., Think-Pair-Share, Conversation Cues, and total participation techniques) to engage all students in collaborative discussion about the text.

- Note that the culminating task for this close read is not completed until the Closing and Assessment section of this lesson.

<th>Before reading, display a world map, and point out the United States and Russia.</th>
<th><ul>
<li><p>Explain that in the 1950s and 1960s, Russia was part of a large and powerful country called the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The USSR had a communist government, with only one party in power. The United States, on the other hand, had a democratic government where people could vote for different parties. The United States and the USSR were known as the world’s superpowers.</p></li>
<li><p>Explain that just a few years before, in 1945, the world had emerged from World War II, which claimed the lives of millions of people—both in the military and civilians. Though they were allies during WWII, the United States and USSR grew suspicious of each other after the war, and tensions quickly arose between the two superpowers.</p></li>

<li><p>Ask: “What is this text about?” (the Space Race between the United States and the USSR)</p></li>
<li><p>Explain that you have just read an argument essay. As students will remember, an argument essay is a piece of writing where the author has an opinion, or claim, about what they are writing. In a good argument, the author supports that claim with some accurate information, or evidence.</p></li>
<li><p>Explain that in the next lesson we will look closely at sections of the text in order to better understand how the author builds his argument. For now, we will concentrate on understanding the key ideas in the text, including several new terms.</p></li>

<li><p>If helpful, demonstrate a book standing up, then slowly push on the top of the book until it falls over. Explain that the point at which the balance shifted, causing the book to finally fall, was the tipping point.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “What does this sentence show about how important the Space Race was?” (It made a big difference in the world. The relationship between the United States and the USSR was deeply affected by the Space Race.)</p></li>
<li><p>Underline the words <em>race</em>, <em>compete</em>, <em>rivalry</em>, and <em>outdo</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “How are all these words related?” (They all have to do with people trying to win something or to surpass an opponent.)</p></li>
<li><p>Explain that all of these terms have to do with the Cold War.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “What do you think the term <em>Cold War</em> might mean? How might a <em>cold</em> war differ from a <em>hot</em> war?” (A Cold War is a rivalry between two countries. It is not hot because it does not use weapons and destruction, but carries on the rivalry in other ways.)</p></li>
<li><p>Look at the last sentence of this paragraph again, and take turns paraphrasing it with a partner.</p></li>
<li><p>Turn and Talk: “What does this final sentence of the paragraph tell us about space and the Cold War?” (The Space Race was an important part of the way the Cold War unfolded.)</p></li>

<li><p>Turn and Talk: “What kind of leap is the writer describing here? Why do you think he chooses that word?” (here, <em>leap</em> is not a physical jump, but a big change. The writer wants to show what a big change this new thinking about technology creates)</p></li>

<li><p>Explain that a paradigm is a view of the world, and here the landing on the moon made people see their world in a different way.</p></li>
<li><p>Turn and Talk: “Can you think of a time you had a paradigm shift in your life? What event caused you to see the world in a new way?” (Responses will vary, but may include: when my grandmother died, it made me realize that life is short, and I should appreciate each day more.)</p></li>

Why might both countries have decided to go along with it?” (Responses will vary, but may include: The world was still recovering from two global wars. The United Nations probably realized that space could easily become another possible battleground, and they wanted to set ground rules before things got that serious. The United States and USSR probably agreed because they had been involved in both world wars and did not want to suffer any more losses.)</p></li>

What words or phrases indicate that purpose?” (Responses will vary, but may include: The author’s purpose for writing this article is to persuade the reader that “the Space Race is one of the most iconic moments in the history of mankind.” This is demonstrated by the author’s use of language that clearly shows an opinion or bias. For example, the author uses words and phrases like <em>tipping point</em> and <em>benchmark</em> to talk about the impact the Space Race had. The author also indicates that “dominance” in space science would require technological and ideological “superiority.” These words have strong connotations which the author chose on purpose to persuade the audience to agree with his point of view toward the topic.)</p></li>
