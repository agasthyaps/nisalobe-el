Picture Puzzles: Space Race and the Cold War

**Note to Teachers:** Print each image onto cardstock, including the caption. Cut off the caption to use as a guide to help students understand the type of image they should be assembling. Cut each Picture Puzzle image into several pieces. Place all of the pieces of each puzzle in a plastic bag or envelope with the corresponding image number. Make several copies of each puzzle so that students can work in small groups (some groups will assemble the same puzzle). Instruct students to find and read the caption before beginning to assemble the puzzle. Make one copy of each complete picture image and caption to display in Opening A.

<p>After World War II, former allies the United States and the Soviet Union entered into a Cold War. Tension between the two countries was caused by a number of issues: Americans feared that Russia’s Communist political system would allow another dictator to come to power, and Russia was resentful that the USA delayed in entering WWII while millions of Russians died.</p>

| Besides a Space Race, the Cold War also involved an arms race, during which the United States and the USSR worked to develop the most advanced weapons. By 1953, both countries had created intercontinental ballistic missiles that could attack each other from great distances. |
