Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.6.1 – Work Time A: Students participate in a close read of a new text, “This Is How the Space Race Changed the Great Power Rivalry Forever.” They use textual evidence to answer questions about the text.

- RI.6.2 – Work Time A: During the close read, students identify details that convey central ideas in the text.

- RI.6.4 – Work Time A: During the close read, students determine the meanings and connotations of words as they are used in the text.

- RI.6.6 – Work Time A: During the close read, students analyze the author’s point of view toward the Space Race.

- RI.6.6 – Closing and Assessment A: As part of a culminating task for the close read, students determine the author’s purpose for writing the article and identify words and phrases that indicate that purpose.

- In Work Time A, students participate in a close reading of “This Is How the Space Race Changed the Great Power Rivalry Forever.” During this close read, students focus on determining the meanings of unfamiliar words by utilizing the context, their knowledge of affixes, and reference resources. By gaining a basic understanding of the text, students can then analyze it for the author’s point of view and purpose. The Close Reading Guide lists the text excerpts, key questions to ask students, and instructional moves required. Continue to use discussion protocols (e.g., Think-Pair-Share, Conversation Cues, and total participation techniques) to engage all students in a collaborative discussion about the text.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Encourage students to explore the *USA Today* project “1968: The Year That Transformed the Nation” (http://eled.org/0266) to build more background knowledge of the time period that is the focus of this module. Allow students to decide how they want to demonstrate their learning for their peers (e.g., bulletin board, slide show, or audio recording).

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the first half of the unit, students read several informational texts, examined primary resources to build context about the Space Race, the major events of this time, and the major players who are often presented as the center of the story. For the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment in the previous lesson, students analyzed an informational text for the author’s point of view and how it was conveyed through key details as well as figurative and connotative language. In the second half of the unit, students continue to examine the scientific, political, and social context of the Space Race through texts that present an argument about this historic time period.

Support All Students

- Students may need additional support with recording their answers on their note-catchers. Group those students together for additional support when necessary.

- During the close read, use strategic combinations of Conversation Cues to help ELLs clarify their ideas, listen carefully to one another, and deepen their thinking. ▲ Some examples are given below:

- “I’ll give you a minute to think and write or sketch.” (Goal 1)

- “So, do you mean \_\_\_?” (Goal 1)

- “What in the text makes you think so?” (Goal 3)

- “Who can repeat what your classmate said?” (Goal 2)

- “Who can add on to what your classmate said?” (Goal 4)

- To support ELLs, this lesson features a close read that guides students through a new text, “This Is How the Space Race Changed the Great Power Rivalry Forever.” Close reads support ELLs by slowing the pace of student reading and inviting students to answer questions that clarify and challenge their understanding of the text’s central ideas and supporting details.

- ELLs may find it challenging to interpret the new text in Work Time A. The texts of Lessons 2–4 presented a chronological series of events, culminating with the Apollo 11 moon landing. The texts of this and the following lesson build upon students’ understanding of Apollo 11 events and introduce them to arguments for and against the Space Race. If students struggle to interpret the text, tell them that they will have multiple opportunities to break down and analyze the text’s ideas: the same text will be examined again, for a new purpose, in the following lesson. Knowing that they have sufficient time with the new text may help ease students’ nerves about their level of comprehension.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.2, 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.7, 6.I.B.8, 6.II.A.1, 6.II.A.2, 6.II.B.3, 6.II.B.4, 6.II.B.5, and 6.II.B.6.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Close Read note-catchers to ensure students understand different strategies for determining technical vocabulary and how to use their new learning to infer the author’s point of view toward the Space Race and purpose for writing the article. Remind students that, although this is an argument text, they will not be required to trace the argument in the text until Lesson 7.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive about “This Is How the Space Race Changed the Great Power Rivalry Forever” and read and annotate a new supplemental text for central idea.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- Distribute the Close Read: “This Is How the Space Race Changed the Great Power Rivalry Forever” note-catcher in advance of the close read in Work Time A, and allow students to review the questions. Knowing what information to look for to respond to these questions will help to guide students’ attention as they read, helping them to focus on essential information and language.

Closing and Assessment

A. Close Read Culminating Task – RI.6.6 (5 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can determine the author’s purpose and point of view in a text about the Space Race.”

- Ask students to focus on the culminating task question and then complete it independently.

- After 4 minutes, refocus whole group to review student responses or collect the note-catchers as a formative assessment. Refer to Close Read: “This Is How the Space Race Changed the Great Power Rivalry Forever” note-catcher (example for teacher reference) as necessary.

- Repeated routine: invite students to reflect on their habit of character focus for this lesson.

For Lighter Support

- In the following lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from an excerpt from “This Is How the Space Race Changed the Great Power Rivalry.” Consider providing ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Invite students who need lighter support to paraphrase the sentence in their own words before the Language Dive. In the Reconstruct section of the Language Dive, students will be asked to complete a similar task. Students can compare their original paraphrases to those they produce during the Language Dive. If their sentences are markedly different, students may wish to reflect on the role of the Language Dive in helping to clarify understanding of the sentence.

For Heavier Support

- In the following lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from an excerpt from “This Is How the Space Race Changed the Great Power Rivalry.” Consider providing ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Invite students who need heavier support to use translation or learners’ dictionaries to translate the sentence into their home languages.
