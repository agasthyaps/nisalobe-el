Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RL.6.6 – Opening A: Students add to their Analyze Point of View: *Two Roads* handouts with information about characters’ points of view in chapters 10 and 11 of the text.

- RL.6.1 – Work Time B: Students engage in a Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol, using evidence from the text to support their analysis of the text and its structure.

- RL.6.3 – Work Time B: During the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol, students answer questions about how Cal responses to challenging events within chapter 12 of the text.

- RL.6.5 – Work Time B: During the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol, students answer questions about the way in which a scene within chapter 12 functions with the larger structure of the chapter and helps develop the plot of the text.

- RL.6.3 – Closing and Assessment A: Students complete a QuickWrite in which they reflect on how Cal’s character, specifically his relationship to his own Creek identity, develops in the text.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- In Lesson 2, students created interactive character windows to express their understanding of how characters respond to challenges (RL.6.3). If time allows, consider creating new Character Windows to reinforce the learning during Opening A.

- The homework resource for Lesson 6 contains photographs from the Bonus Army demonstrations on Washington, DC. If time allows, consider asking students to revisit those alongside the text of Cal’s vision during Work Time B.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Students have been reading several chapters in the anchor text as Cal learns about his Creek identity and prepares to enroll at Challagi Indian Industrial School. As the plot unfolds, students have been analyzing the ways in which the author develops the characters and their points of view. In this lesson, students continue practicing those skills with increased independence as they build towards the End of Unit 1 Assessment in Lesson 15.

Support All Students

- In Chapter 12, Cal and Pop reach Challagi. They discuss some of the American Indian students they see there, speculating on whether they are “full-bloods” (141). Meanwhile, Cal continues to grapple with some complicated elements of his own racial identity: “I don’t have a white face. But until two days ago, I thought I was white or stahitkey as Pop called them” (141). Depending on how they understand their own identities, some students may feel especially connected to these passages. A QuickWrite during Closing and Assessment A in this lesson offers students the opportunity to explore some of these ideas in a safe way. Give students the opportunity to share their thoughts with small groups, but do not require them to do so.

- To support ELLs, this lesson continues to build upon students’ understanding of point of view in a text in preparation for the end of unit assessment of Lesson 15. To answer questions related to point of view and plot development, students participate in another Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol, which accommodates additional processing time for students and gives them the opportunity to work with and learn from multiple classmates. This lesson also includes a QuickWrite activity based on the prompt, *When Cal thinks about being Creek, he probably feels \_\_\_ because \_\_\_*. This QuickWrite supports direct connections between the text and the module guiding questions; it also may feel especially resonant to ELLs, for whom issues of identity may be strongly felt in the English-speaking classroom.

- ELLs may find it challenging to read chapter 12 in its entirety during the time available and may also find it difficult to keep track of all of the information that has been presented so far in the text. Strongly encourage students to reread the chapter independently at home on their own time to make sure that they do not miss important plot details. This may also be an appropriate time to reiterate the value of prereading assigned chapters as homework before class.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.2, 6.I.B.5, 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.7, and 6.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- The questions on Analyze Plot Development: Chapter 12 have been designed to mimic those from the End of Unit 1 Assessment. Consider collecting this handout to track students’ progress towards RL.6.3, RL.6.5, and RL.6.6. Identify areas that are broadly misunderstood and create a mini lesson to address those gaps prior to the assessment.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will read chapters 13 and 14 in *Two Roads* and update their Analyze Point of View note-catcher. Students will also be introduced to two new standards focused on language and grammar. First, students will learn when and how to use intensive pronouns and distinguish them from reflexive pronouns. Students will also discuss how purpose, setting, and audience influence how characters speak and interact with other characters.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Preread chapter 12 of *Two Roads* to identify potentially challenging vocabulary or plot points.

- Review the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol (see full version in the Classroom Protocols document on the Tools Page: http://eled.org/tools) and the modification used during Work Time B. Decide if students will be allowed to choose their own partners or if some students will be assigned specific partners.

- Review the new materials used in this lesson to ensure clarity about what students will need to know and be able to do.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time A: Strategic use of an audiobook version of the novel can aid students’ comprehension of the text and help them to maintain focus as serious topics are broached in the novel, such as those presented in chapter 12.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RL.6.6 (5 minutes)

- Direct students to retrieve their **Analyze Point of View: *Two Roads*** **note-catcher** and anchor text, ***Two Roads***. Instruct students to fill in the row for chapters 10 and 11 about Cal’s point of view towards his identity, recalling the reading they did in the previous lesson, as well as the Language Dive. Remind students to reference the text for evidence rather than relying on memory. Use **equity sticks** to call on students to share their entries. Refer to **Analyze Point of View: *Two Roads*** **note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar to or the same as previous lessons. Invite students to choose a habit of character focus for themselves for this lesson.

Work Time

A. Read *Two Roads*, Chapter 12 – RL.6.1 (20 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Read chapter 12 of the text, using **Text Guide: *Two Roads*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students who are ready to read independently or in small groups should be released to this independence. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Students continue to identify how characters in the text demonstrate habits of character. Refer to the **Gist anchor chart: *Two Roads*** **(example for teacher reference)** and **chapter synopsis** as needed, as well as any other appropriate resources.

- Gist: Cal and Pop arrive at Challagi and meet Superintendent Morrell, who remembers Pop as a student. Cal watches the students do marching drills and grows more nervous.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

B. Analyze Plot and Character Development – RL.6.3, RL.6.5 (15 minutes)

- Explain that they’re going to take a closer look at structure in the chapters of *Two Roads* and begin thinking about how that structure contributes to the development of the plot and also our understanding of the characters.

- Ask students to recall the types of organizational structures they learned about during Modules 1 and 2 (problem and solution, cause and effect, compare and contrast, and chronological/sequential).

- Ask:

“How would you describe the structure of *Two Roads*?” (The novel itself is structured in chronological order, as are the chapters. The story is told by Cal, who is narrating, and he uses the present tense to tell us the story as it happens.)

- Explain that narrative texts, even if they’re informational like The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind, generally use some kind of chronological or sequential organization. This organization is driven by the events of the plot and setting.

- Point out that the novel is separated into three parts: Part 1 “On the Road March 1932,” Part 2 “At Challagi School,” and Part 3 “A Different Road.” Part 2 starts at chapter 12, which they just read.

- Ask:

“What do each of these sections signal to the reader?” (That a major shift or change is happening, specifically that the setting is changing and will likely lead to new experiences for Cal.)

- Prepare students to engage in the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol. Remind students that they have done this protocol before. Cold-call students to review the steps of the protocol (students face away from their partners as they listen to a question; students turn around when the signal is given and take turns sharing their response and actively listening to their partner’s response). Explain that one modification will be made to the protocol for today’s activity. After each question, students will move back-to-back with a different partner.

- Direct students to the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Ask:

“What does an ethical person do when choosing partners?” (An ethical person shows compassion by making sure everyone is included and every person feels welcome to join a partnership. An ethical person shows respect by using appropriate body language and eye contact to accept someone’s offer to work together. An ethical person shows integrity by choosing a partner who will help them to stay on task, even if that means not working with a close friend.)

- Move students into partners. Direct students to turn back-to-back with their partner. Students may wish to look at their text as an excerpt is read aloud.

- Reread from pages 129–130, starting at “There’s also a design . . . “ and ending at, “I nod but I’m not okay.”

- Face-to-face:

“How would you describe what just happened to Cal?” (Answers will vary.)

- Ensure that students understand that occasionally and without warning Cal has these immersive visions in which he embodies someone else’s seemingly real experience.

- Direct students to quickly move to a new partner and turn back-to-back.

- Face-to-face:

“Are Cal’s visions real?” (Answers will vary, but may include: They are real in the sense that he is actually experiencing these thoughts, but they are happening only within his brain, not in the physical world.)

- Direct students to quickly move to a new partner and turn back-to-back.

- Face-to-face:

“How does Cal’s vision function within the structure of the chapter? How does this vision help to develop the plot of *Two Roads*?” (Answers will vary, but may include: This vision, while it occurs within the chronological sequence of the chapter, puts Cal into another time and place, pulling him out the larger narrative for a moment. It may be foreshadowing for the reader what might occur or possibly revealing an event that has already occurred. It sets the mood, showing that an experience that seems positive may turn bad.)

- Direct students to quickly move to a new partner and turn back-to-back.

- Reread the next lines on page 130, starting at “For just a moment . . . “ and ending at, “ . . . and step out.”

- Face-to-face:

“How does the way Cal responds to the challenging events of the vision and his father’s question help to develop our understanding of his character?” (Answers will vary, but may include: It shows how deeply connected Cal feels towards other people, especially his father; it shows he is selfless and wants to protect his father’s feelings—he tells him he is OK when he’s not. He puts Pop’s comfort above his own. He believes in sticking to the promise that Cal and Pop take care of each other. Cal spares Pop’s feelings and takes care of Pop by standing up straight and moving forward.)

- Refocus whole group. Direct students to retrieve their **Analyze Character: *Two Roads*** **note-catcher**. Instruct students to fill in the row for chapter 12 using the example discussed. Refer to **Analyze Character: *Two Roads*** **note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** as needed.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time B, adapt the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol by repeating the protocol several times in a row with the same partners. This will give students who need heavier support more opportunities to check their understanding and clarify their partner’s ideas.

Closing and Assessment

A. QuickWrite: Reflect on Chapter 12 – RL.6.3 (5 minutes)

- Distribute the **QuickWrite: Reflect on Chapter 12** handout.

- Read aloud the prompt:

- “When Cal thinks about being Creek, he probably feels \_\_\_\_ because \_\_\_\_.”

- Point out that the prompt guides students to use evidence from the text in their response; however, students are welcome to elaborate on their response by making personal connections to Cal’s experience.

- Invite students to begin writing. Refer to the **QuickWrite: Reflect on Chapter 12 (example for teacher reference)**.

- With one minute left, refocus students. Cold-call students to share just the adjective they used to complete the first blank in the prompt. As student responses may have been personal, do not collect the QuickWrite.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their habit of character focus for this lesson.

Homework

A. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread chapters 13 and 14 in *Two Roads* in preparation for studying these chapters in the next lesson.
