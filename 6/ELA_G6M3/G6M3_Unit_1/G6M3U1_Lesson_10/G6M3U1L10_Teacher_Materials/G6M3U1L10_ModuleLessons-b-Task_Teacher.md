When Cal thinks about being Creek, he probably feels \_\_\_\_ because \_\_\_\_.

Answers will vary, but may include: When Cal thinks about being Creek, he probably feels conflicted because this identity is news to him. Cal is 12 years old and has spent his whole life believing that he is white. He has also gotten used to being treated as if he is white. Suddenly, he has gone from a position of privilege to being treated as lower class. This is demonstrated when Superintendent Morrell refers to American Indians as “savage.” However, within the student population, students with lighter hair and skin are referred to as *stahitkey*. This is a rude term for a white person. Being “full-blood” is a point of pride among the actual students. Navigating these different identities likely feels very confusing and conflicting for Cal.
