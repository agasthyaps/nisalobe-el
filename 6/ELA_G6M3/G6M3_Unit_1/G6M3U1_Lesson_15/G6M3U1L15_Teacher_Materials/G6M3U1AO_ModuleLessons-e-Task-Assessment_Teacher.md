13. **Part A**

14. He is feeling confident in himself.

15. He is feeling disappointed in himself.

16. He is feeling angry at himself.

17. <u>He is feeling unsure of himself.</u>

**Part B**

Choose <u>two</u> details from the text that <u>best</u> support the answer to Part A. (RL.6.1)

“Maybe they think I’m not worth knowing” (186).

“Maybe he’s just putting up with me” (186).

“I’ll be on my own, without Pop to guide me and be by my side every day and every night” (186).

“I’ll be alone in a crowd of kids who have nothing in common with me” (186).

18. Review the dialogue spoken by Cal and by Possum in the excerpt. What do you notice about the differences in the language varieties that each character uses? What do Cal’s and Possum’s use of language help to convey about each of their characters in this excerpt? (RL.6.1, RL.6.3, L.6.1e)

Cal speaks very few words. When he does speak, he uses a more academic English variety. On the other hand, Possum goes back and forth between more academic and more social English varieties. The difference in how they use language shows a difference in how each feels. Cal is feeling unsure of himself, which is shown in his few words. He is also unsure of his relationship with Possum, so he uses more academic English rather than a more social variety. Possum is comfortable and likes Cal, so his words come easily. He sees Cal as a friend, so he uses a social English variety.

19. **Part A**

“As we walk along, I notice something. Set back a ways behind those buildings is an ugly low flat-roofed stone structure that looks out of place. While the other buildings have had at least a few people around them, this one is totally deserted. It’s not just dark in color, it has an air of darkness around it—as if bad things happened there—were meant to happen there” (186).

Which <u>best</u> describes the function of this paragraph within the structure of the excerpt? (RL.6.5)

20. This paragraph ends an important moment when Bruchac shows us Cal’s thinking.

21. <u>This paragraph starts an important moment between Cal and Possum in the chapter.</u>

22. This paragraph reinforces Cal’s point of view toward himself in this chapter.

23. This paragraph foreshadows that something bad will happen to Cal at school.

**Part B**

How does that paragraph help to develop the plot and characters of *Two Roads*? (RL.6.1, RL.6.3, RL.6.5)

This paragraph is the start of a moment that is important for two reasons.

The first reason is that the building described in this paragraph triggers Cal to have another vision. He tries to hide what’s happening, but Possum makes clear he knows. He also seems to know that it’s something normal.

The second reason is that this building also triggers Possum to share something personal and upsetting about his own past with Cal. Both of these events help Cal realize that Possum is really his true friend and strengthens their friendship.
