**Chapter 18, “New Duds”**

- Possum and Cal watch Pop walk away.

- During the walk through the school grounds with Possum, Cal sees a building that is strikingly different from the other buildings. Possum notices where Cal is looking and tells Cal that no one goes near the building anymore. The old guardhouse is no longer used to lock up a student when he breaks a rule.

- Cal is mentally transported into the guardhouse. Possum snaps Cal out of the vision by asking Cal where he’s at. Possum then asks Cal if the visions happen to Cal often.

- Cal is surprised by Possum’s question. When asked if he wants to talk about it, Cal declines.

- Possum continues to talk about the discipline at the school, which leads Possum to confide in Cal that Possum’s scar came from getting slapped by somebody with a ring. The ring cut Possum’s face and left the scar.

- Possum and Cal reach the tailor shop. Cal is introduced to Skinny.

- Possum and Skinny check their surroundings then greet each other in Creek.

- Skinny provides Cal with clothing and Cal changes. Skinny does a handshake with Cal and Cal picks up the moves quickly.

- Possum and Cal head to the shoe and harness shop.

- Possum stops Cal and they do the handshake again. Possum is surprised when Cal reveals that the first time doing the handshake was just a few minutes ago with Skinny.

- Possum informs Cal that the handshake is the Challagi Creek Handshake. The handshake means that a person has been accepted into the group.

- Cal is confronted by Bear Meat, who is the leader of the gang.

- Bear Meat asks Cal to empty his pockets, then tells Cal he’ll wrestle him for the jack knife Cal has in his possession.

- Bear Meat and Cal engage. Bear Meat fails to throw Cal out of the circle on the first try. Cal pays attention to how Bear Meat moves and what he does. Bear Meat puts all his weight on Cal, and Cal is flattened on the ground.

- Possum lets out a warning call, and Bear Meat gets off of Cal.

- The head disciplinarian demands to know what happened. Cal informs the head disciplinarian that Bear Meat helped him up after he tripped.

- The head disciplinarian makes a rude comment to Cal and then leaves.

- Bear Meat wraps his arm around Cal’s shoulder. Cal offers up the knife. Bear Meat tells Cal to keep the knife and invites Cal to sit at their table at mealtime.
