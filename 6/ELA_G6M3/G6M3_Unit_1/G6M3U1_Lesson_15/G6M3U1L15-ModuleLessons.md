Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Work Time A: Students complete the End of Unit 1 Assessment. They read the beginning of chapter 18 (pages 184–189) of *Two Roads* and answer selected response and short constructed response questions to analyze the structure of the text, interpret the use of intensive pronouns, examine how Bruchac develops Cal’s point of view, and describe the impact of using language varieties on the development of characters within the text. (RL.6.1, RL.6.3, RL.6.5, RL.6.6, RL.6.10, L.6.1b, L.6.1e)

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners by reading and answering questions independently for the end of unit assessment. Prompt students’ perseverance by reminding them that assessments are meant to inform instruction. Use assessment data to make choices about what should be retaught and how to adjust the pacing. Encourage students not to be afraid of mistakes; an accurate assessment is crucial for tailoring lessons to students’ needs.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Some students may not need extensive review of the assessment directions. Release them to begin working on the assessment while clarification is provided to other students who need more support.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the second half of this unit, students read several chapters of *Two Roads*, analyzing point of view, character development, and Bruchac’s use of language. This lesson continues those routines in an assessment, asking students to apply their learning to a new chapter of *Two Roads*.

Support All Students

- As with any assessment, students may feel nervous to read new passages independently and answer questions about them. Point out all the preparation they have had through activities, homework, and in-class reading time. Also, remind them there will be other opportunities throughout Module 3 to demonstrate what they have learned.

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study, as well as the goals of the assessment.

- For some students, this assessment may require more than the 30 minutes allotted. Consider providing time over multiple days if necessary.

- An opportunity to track their progress after the assessment helps students reflect on and celebrate their growth.

- To support ELLs, this lesson invites students to complete assessment tasks similar to the classroom tasks in Lessons 7–14. Students read an excerpt from a new chapter of *Two Roads*, and then answer selected and constructed response questions about the text. Although the chapter is new to students, students are already familiar with the text’s characters, setting, and style. Reading a chapter from a familiar text allows students to build upon their existing understanding of the text, rather than start from scratch to interpret something entirely new.

- ELLs may find it challenging to independently complete the end of unit assessment without scaffolding. Point out that the end of unit assessment is similar to the activities they have successfully completed in class. Encourage students to do their best, and assure them that they will continue learning together after the assessment.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.7, 6.I.B.8, and 6.II.A.1.

Assessment Guidance

- All assessment materials, the student and teacher versions of End of Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Point of View, Structure, and Language: *Two Roads*, Chapter 18, are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback on this assessment, use the answer key and sample student responses (see Assessment Overview and Resources) to help complete students’ Track Progress recording form.

- Using information from this assessment, students are tracking progress toward anchor standards:

- R.1: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.

- R.10: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Read and comprehend complex literary and informational texts independently and proficiently.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will return to the anchor text, *Two Roads*, at chapter 20 and continue reading. They continue their analysis of point of view and character development.

- Students’ End of Unit 1 Assessments will be returned in Unit 2, Lesson 7 with feedback.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare End of Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Point of View, Structure, and Language: *Two Roads*, Chapter 18.

- Ensure feedback from the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment is ready for Opening A.

- Review the student tasks and example answers to get familiar with what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Prepare copies of handouts for students, including entrance ticket (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous modules to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 15**. Students will also need their **Mid-Unit 1 Assessment with feedback**.

- Once all students are ready, invite them to share their “stars” and “steps” with a partner. Remind students that everyone is working toward individual goals and that learning is about continued growth and development.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar to or the same as previous lessons.

Work Time

A. End of Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Point of View, Structure, and Language: *Two Roads*, Chapter 18 (30 minutes)

- Distribute **End of Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Point of View, Structure, and Language: *Two Roads***, **Chapter 18**, and invite students to retrieve their copies of ***Two Roads***.

- Tell students that for this assessment, they will read an excerpt of a new chapter of *Two Roads*. In this assessment, students analyze the development of Cal’s point of view, the structure of the text, the use of intensive pronouns, and the impact of the use of language varieties on character development.

- Invite students to follow along, reading silently in their heads, while the directions for each part of the assessment are read aloud. Make sure students understand the directions; paraphrase some instructions, if needed. ▲ Answer students’ questions, but refrain from supplying answers to the assessment questions themselves.

- Direct students’ attention to the following anchor charts:

- **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart**

- **Strategies to Answer Selected Response Questions anchor chart**

- Remind students to refer to these anchor charts as they read the assessment text and answer the assessment questions.

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence. Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart** and review what perseverance looks and sounds like. Remind students that because they will be reading and answering questions independently for the assessment, they may need to practice perseverance.

- Invite students to begin the assessment.

- While they are taking the assessment, circulate to monitor and document their test-taking skills.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- Before the assessment of Work Time A, underline key vocabulary in the assessment directions and prompt and read aloud together as a class to ensure that students understand each task included in the assessment. Invite students who need lighter support to restate or clarify information for students who need heavier support.

- Before the assessment, invite students who need lighter support to revisit the sentence frames from the Practice section of the Mini Language Dive of Lesson 12:

- I study \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (adverb), \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

- Challenge students to rewrite this frame so that it contains only blank spaces and part of speech information For example:

- \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (noun phrase) + \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (verb phrase) + \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (adverb), \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (*-ing* verb phrase) and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (*-ing* verb phrase).

- Display this frame during the end of unit assessment for all students, including those who need heavier support, to reference as needed. This frame may be especially useful for students as they answer constructed response questions on the assessment. For example:

- Possum speaks flexibly, using casual idioms sometimes and speaking in complete sentences other times.

For Heavier Support

- Display a “map” of the assessment to reference while explaining directions to the end of unit assessment. This will reduce ambiguity and give students a clearer picture of what they can expect so that they can better allocate their time and attentional resources. Provide students with colored pencils or highlighters so that they can mark up the map as needed. Example:

- Read pages 184–189 of chapter 18 in *Two Roads*. Then answer the questions.

- Question 1: Identify sentences that correctly use intensive pronouns.

- Question 2: Identify a sentence that correctly uses an intensive pronoun and insert it in a paragraph.

- Question 3: Use evidence from the text to determine what Cal’s inner thoughts convey about his point of view.

- Question 4: Describe Cal’s and Possum’s use of language and explain what it conveys about their characters.

- Question 5: Identify the function of a paragraph within the excerpt and explain how it develops the plot and characters.

- Question 6: Use evidence from the text to determine Cal’s point of view toward Possum.

- After students who need lighter support generate a more sparse sentence frame (see the accompanying suggestion in For Lighter Support), invite students who need heavier support to practice filling in the frames with simple statements about Cal and Possum. Provide examples as needed (e.g., Cal speaks softly, using few words and listening to others). This will refresh students’ memories about the function and use of the sentence frame and prepare them to adapt it for their own writing, if they choose, during the end of unit assessment.

Closing and Assessment

A. Track Progress – RL.6.1 (10 minutes)

- Give students specific, positive feedback on their completion of the End of Unit 1 Assessment. Provide students with **Synopsis: *Two Roads***, **Chapter 18** if students need clarification on the chapter they read for the assessment.

- Distribute **Track Progress folders, Track Progress: Read, Understand, and Explain New Text, Writing Record**, and **sticky notes**.

- Tell students the sticky notes are for them to find evidence of the following criteria:

- RL.6.1

- Guide students through completing the form. Encourage students to orally paraphrase the meaning of the Track Progress criteria, self-assess, and discuss the evidence with a partner before they begin writing. Direct students to complete the Writing Record for the writing they did as part of the End of Unit 1 Assessment (constructed responses).

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Analyze Point of View

- Students complete the next row on their **Analyze Point of View: *Two Roads*** **note-catcher** using evidence from chapter 18 in *Two Roads*.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread chapter 20 in *Two Roads* in preparation for studying this chapter in the next lesson.
