Homework: Analyze Structure and Point of View: *Two Roads*, Chapter 13

(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Reread the end of chapter 13, starting on page 148 at “‘Sunday,’ he says to me . . .” Then answer the questions.

1.  What do Pop’s words to Cal in this excerpt convey about his point of view toward the school? (RL.6.1, RL.6.6)

Though his time at the school was difficult, he and his friends found ways to enjoy and be themselves.

2.  What do Superintendent Morrell’s words to Cal and his dad in this excerpt convey about his point of view toward the running of the school? (RL.6.1, RL.6.6)

Discipline and punishment are necessary for students who do not follow orders, but they have evolved and no longer use the harsh or primitive means of Cal’s father’s days at the school to punish students.

3.  Which <u>best</u> describes the function of this section within the structure of the chapter? (RL.6.5)

4.  This section expands our understanding about Cal and his point of view toward the school.

5.  This section introduces a new character who might be important to the plot of the story.

6.  <u>This section highlights tension between dad and Morrell’s points of view toward the school.</u>

7.  This section foreshadows that something bad will happen to Cal at school after dad leaves.

8.  How does this section help develop the setting and characters of *Two Roads*? (RL.6.1, RL.6.5, W.6.10)

This section helps to develop the setting of the story because it provides the reader with additional information about Cal’s dad’s experiences at Challagi. And it also gives us more insight into Morrell, who creates the environment at the school and which Cal will have to endure. We understand more about Cal’s dad as we see him react to Morrell’s words, and also how he notices when Cal needs a little encouragement. The tension between the good and bad of his dad’s experiences at Challagi are shown through the interactions between his dad and Morrell. This chapter also shows us that things seem to have improved since his father’s time there; there was far more abuse and violence in those days, which seems to have been reduced with Morrell in charge. We learn that Morrell might be better than the other superintendents, but he is still rigid and expects students to follow the rules or face consequences.
