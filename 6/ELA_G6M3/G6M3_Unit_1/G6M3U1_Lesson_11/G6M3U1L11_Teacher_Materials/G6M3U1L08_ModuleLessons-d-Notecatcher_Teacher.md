How does Cal’s point of view about the Indian schools compare and contrast with the perspectives of the other supplemental texts?

Answers will vary, but may include:

- Zitkala-Sa:

<!-- -->

- Cal’s point of view about Challagi is similar to Zitkala-Sa’s point of view toward Carlisle. Just like Cal in chapter 14, Zitkala-Sa also uses figurative language to convey her fear. They both feel like they are being treated like captive animals. In “Iron Routine,” she says “I have many times trudged in the day's harness heavy-footed, like a dumb sick brute.” In “The Cutting of My Hair,” she says “I was only one of many little animals driven by a herder.”

- In chapter 15, Cal also gets his hair cut in a rough fashion like Zitkala-Sa. The nurse in *Two Roads* seems to be as unhearing and unseeing as the adults at Zitkala-Sa’s school. This is similar to the “iron routine” Zitkala-Sa references. Cal and Zitkala-Sa both follow procedures in a mechanical and detached way.

<!-- -->

- Captain Pratt:

<!-- -->

- Captain Pratt’s point of view is expressed in his speech in the novel, especially through the character of Superintendent Morrell. Pratt and Morrell both believe that it is the “noble mission of this fine institution” to help Indians by making them into useful citizens. By teaching them “new modern ways,” Indians can be saved from their “savage life” and achieve their “true, higher purpose.”

- Cal’s point of view is in direct contrast to Pratt’s. He says that “the true purpose of this place is to wear the Indian out.” He is bored, exhausted, and anxious to leave and be with Pop. Many of his classes involve no actual learning or he is taught things he already learned. In Cal’s opinion, the school is not “civilizing” him, but rather, teaching him how to be more white.

<!-- -->

- Meriam Report:

<!-- -->

- Cal’s point of view closely aligns with the findings of the Meriam Report. The Meriam Report highlights the inadequate diet, hard labor, unqualified teachers, and constant abuse that the students face. Cal has experienced all of these.
