American Indian Boarding Schools

Grade 6: Module 3: Unit 1: Lesson 11

Lesson Overview

Lesson Summary

Students read chapters 13 and 14 in *Two Roads* and update their Analyze Point of View note-catcher. Students are introduced to two new standards focused on language and grammar. First, students learn when and how to use intensive pronouns and distinguish them from reflexive pronouns. Students also discuss how purpose, setting, and audience influence how characters speak and interact with other characters.

CCS Standards

Focus Standards

These are the standards the instruction addresses.

- RL.6.1, RL.6.3, RL.6.6, L.6.1e, L.6.5a, L.6.5c

Supporting Standards

These are the standards that are incidental—no direct instruction in this lesson, but practice of these standards occurs as a result of addressing the focus standards.

- RL.6.10

Daily Learning Targets

- I can analyze a character’s point of view in chapter 12 and how it is developed by the author. (RL.6.6)

- I can analyze the impact of the author’s use of connotative and figurative language to develop Cal’s point of view in chapters 13 and 14 of *Two Roads*. (RL.6.6, L.6.5)

Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RL.6.6 – Opening A: Students add to their Analyze Point of View: *Two Roads* note-catcher handouts with information about characters’ points of view in chapter 12 of the text.

- RL.6.1 – Work Time A: After reading chapters 13 and 14 of *Two Roads*, students answer questions about the text, using textual evidence to support their analysis of figurative language and point of view.

- RL.6.6 – Work Time A: Students answer questions about how similes used in the text convey Cal’s point of view toward his own experiences.

- L.6.5a – Work Time A: Students identify and interpret similes used in chapter 14.

- L.6.5c – Work Time A: Students interpret the connotations of the vocabulary used in the similes of chapter 14.

- RL.6.1 – Work Time B: Using textual evidence to support their ideas, students analyze Possum’s speech in the text and add to their Analyze Language: Possum note-catchers.

- RL.6.3 – Work Time B: Students examine Possum’s language use as a way to analyze how Possum responds to his environment and develops throughout the text.

- L.6.1e – Work Time B: Students analyze the language varieties used by Possum in the text, specifically examining the way in which his speech changes according to his audience and his subject.

- RL.6.3 – Closing and Assessment A: Students analyze and describe Possum’s character in the text.

- L.6.1e – Closing and Assessment A: Students use Possum’s use of language varieties to make inferences about his character in the text.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Students may use the character window activity from Lesson 2 to further analyze Possum’s character using other criteria besides his speech variety. Students may use previous chapters to find more examples to support character analysis.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students read chapter 12 in their anchor text and worked in pairs to review character development, point of view, and how specific sections fit into the overall structure of a text.

Support All Students

- In chapter 13, Pop and Cal witness the discipline of a “recalcitrant” at Challagi (148): the student is locked in a small, dark room for an undisclosed number of days. This passage, though brief, may be upsetting for students. They may also feel distressed by the idea that Pop would feel comfortable leaving Cal in this environment. Encourage students, in writing or in small groups, to speculate about the reasons underlying Pop’s decision.

- In preparation for the End of Unit 1 Assessment, students participate in an activity that asks them to notice how Possum’s speech changes based on the person to whom he is speaking (L.6.1e). It is critical to point out to students that, although some varieties of English may be preferred in certain (i.e., academic) environments, no language variety is “better” than another. ▲

- In Work Time B, one of the examples provided in the sentence strips is purposely ambiguous. Language choices are influenced by several factors that change and conflict all the time. The lesson validates students’ use of language varieties, as well as encourage students to be flexible and adaptable in their language use. Facilitate further discussion around the ambiguous quote. Allow students to explore the reasons why the quote could be directed to a friend or an adult of authority.

- Code-switching will likely be a familiar phenomenon to students who speak more than one language or language variety. Invite students to share examples of code-switching from their own lives. ▲

- It may be more difficult for ELLs to recognize linguistic differences in Possum’s utterances, impeding their ability to successfully complete the code-switching activity. Consider ways to guide ELLs’ attention to specific examples. This can be done through strategically grouping low- and high-proficiency students together. Additionally, consider asking more pointed questions that highlight examples of language variation more clearly (e.g., “What people do we usually address as ‘sir’?”). ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson invites students to use sentence strips to analyze the language used by a key character, Possum, and notice the ways in which his speech changes according to context. All students, but especially ELLs, benefit from the practice of closely examining excerpts of spoken language and analyzing them for their vocabulary, grammar, and overall impact.

- ELLs may find it challenging to interpret Possum’s speech in some of the sentence strips, especially when Possum uses a variety of English that may be less familiar to students. This may make it more challenging for ELLs to apply the primary message of this lesson (i.e., language changes flexibly according to context, audience, and purpose) to their own English-language use. The process of switching among multiple languages or language varieties is a highly sophisticated sociolinguistic process; switching among different varieties of English requires that one understand the at-times conflicting linguistic rules and social impacts of multiple varieties. Help ELLs recognize and celebrate the fact that, as speakers of other languages who use English in certain environments for certain purposes, they are already demonstrating that they are nimble and sophisticated users of language. Once ELLs recognize the extent to which they already switch among languages in their own personal, social, and academic lives, they will be more equipped to understand Possum’s choice to switch among English-language varieties.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.2, 6.I.A.4, 6.I.B.5, 6.I.B.6, and 6.I.B.7.

Assessment Guidance

- Collect the Analyze Language: Possum note-catcher to review student progress on character analysis through language variation analysis.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will read chapter 15 of the anchor text. Students will continue to gather evidence to determine how a character responds and changes based on challenges faced. Students will also be introduced to intensive pronouns and will practice identifying and correctly using intensive pronouns.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RL.6.6 (5 minutes)

- Direct students to retrieve their **Analyze Point of View: *Two Roads*** **note-catcher** and anchor text, ***Two Roads***. Instruct students to fill in the row for chapter 12 about Superintendent Morrell’s point of view towards American Indians, recalling the reading they did in the previous lesson. Students should also reference the **Author’s Methods anchor chart**. Use **equity sticks** to call on students to share their entries. Refer to **Analyze Point of View: *Two Roads*** **note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar to or the same as previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read *Two Roads*, Chapters 13 and 14 – RL.6.6, L.6.5 (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Read chapters 13 and 14 of the text, using **Text Guide: *Two Roads*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students who are ready to read independently or in small groups should be released to this independence. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Students continue to identify how characters in the text demonstrate habits of character. Refer to the **Gist anchor chart: *Two Roads*** **(example for teacher reference)** and **chapter synopsis** as needed, as well as any other appropriate resources.

- Gist of chapter 13: Cal learns about discipline at Challagi. Students have daily chores; one is locked in a wooden box for punishment.

- Gist of chapter 14: Cal meets Possum, a fellow student. He gives Cal his own nickname, Jay Bird, to tease him for being so quiet.

- Ask:

“What similes does Bruchac use on pages 150–152?” (“feeling like a lamb being led to the slaughter,” “pointing his finger like a gun at the boy’s chest,” “those three words hit like arrows shot into my chest,” “Ready to get shaved like a sheep?”)

- Ask:

“What do the connotations of the words and phrases used in these similes help to convey about Cal’s point of view toward what he is experiencing in this chapter?” (These four similes are all related in that they describe animals being at the mercy of humans, either in terms of being farmed—slaughter and shaving—or hunted. These examples of figurative language help to convey the idea that Cal is feeling powerless and at the mercy of the powers around him. He also seems to be waiting for terrible things to happen. It is interesting also that Possum and Cal both have nicknames that are animals \[Possum and a bird\].)

“What connections do you notice between Cal’s point of view in this chapter and that of Zitkala-Sa from her memoir?” (Zitkala-Sa also uses figurative language that conveys her feeling of being treated like a captive animal. In “Iron Routine,” she says “I have many times trudged in the day’s harness heavy-footed, like a dumb sick brute.” In “The Cutting of My Hair,” she says “I was only one of many little animals driven by a herder.”)

- Refocus whole group. Direct students to retrieve their Analyze Point of View: *Two Roads* note-catcher handout. Instruct students to fill in the row for chapter 14 using the example discussed and add notes about connections to Zitkala-Sa at the bottom of the note-catcher. Use equity sticks to call on students to share their entries. Refer to Analyze Point of View: *Two Roads* note-catcher (example for teacher reference) as needed.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

B. Analyze Language Variety – RL.6.3, L.6.1e (20 minutes)

- Direct students to their predetermined partner for the next task.

- Explain that one method authors use to reveal information about a character is the character’s dialogue. The variety of language a character uses can give the reader insight into the character. The next activity will focus on Possum’s language to gain understanding of his character.

- Distribute **Possum Quotes Sentence Strips**. Provide one set of sentence strips to each pair of students.

- Tell students that they will be separating the sentence strips into two categories: 1) Possum may be speaking to a friend. 2) Possum may be speaking to an adult of authority.

- Direct students to the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**. Remind students of what effective collaboration looks like and sounds like.

- Invite students to begin collaborating with their partners to separate the sentences into the two categories.

- Circulate and monitor student progress. Ask probing questions to pairs that seem to need assistance.

- Strategically use combinations of Conversation Cues to deepen students’ thinking:

“Can you say more about that?” (Goal 1)

“Why do you think that?” (Goal 3)

“Do you agree or disagree with what your classmate said? Why?” (Goal 4)

- Regain students’ focus. Distribute **Analyze Language: Possum note-catcher**.

- Read the directions for Part I and read the column headings. Clarify any student misconceptions regarding the task. Reference **Analyze Language: Possum note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Instruct students to not move on to Part II of the activity until asked to do so later in the lesson.

- Direct students to begin working with their partner to fill in the note-catcher.

- Regain students’ focus. Read the directions for Part II. Clarify any student misconceptions regarding the task.

- Monitor student discussions. Redirect student conversation that tries to incorporate other factors in Possum’s character analysis beside his language variety.

- Invite students to turn and talk to another student who is not their partner to share responses to the discussion question.

- Use equity sticks to call on three students to share their response to the discussion question.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- To reinforce L.6.1e work and to help students relate to the content of the lesson, develop an extension activity in which students explore their own code- or style-switching among different languages or varieties of English. Invite students who need lighter support to draw a “map” of the primary spheres in their lives (e.g., home; school; the soccer field; a grandparent’s house) and indicate which language or language variety they speak in each environment. Students should also include statements that explain why they use one language over another in each environment (e.g., because my grandmother only speaks Arabic; because most of the other students on my soccer team are English speakers). Challenge students to produce a summary statement that synthesizes the practice and purpose of code-switching in their own lives.

For Heavier Support

- To reinforce L.6.1e work and to help students relate to the content of the lesson, develop an extension activity in which students explore their own code- or style-switching among different languages or varieties of English. Invite students who need heavier support to draw a “map” of the primary spheres in their lives (e.g., home; school; the soccer field; a grandparent’s house) and indicate which language or language variety they speak in each environment (i.e., by writing a few words from that language within each sphere). Encourage students to reflect aloud, in small groups, on how and why their language use changes in each environment.

Closing and Assessment

A. Analyze Character: Possum – RL.6.3, L.6.1e (5 minutes)

- Regain students’ focus. Read the directions for Part III of the Analyze Language: Possum note-catcher. Clarify any student misconceptions regarding the task.

- Instruct students to complete Part III of the note-catcher.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their habit of character focus for this lesson.

Homework

A. Analyze Structure and Point of View: *Two Roads*, Chapter 13

- Students complete **Homework: Analyze Structure and Point of View: *Two Roads***, **Chapter 13**.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread chapter 15 in *Two Roads* in preparation for studying this chapter in the next lesson.
