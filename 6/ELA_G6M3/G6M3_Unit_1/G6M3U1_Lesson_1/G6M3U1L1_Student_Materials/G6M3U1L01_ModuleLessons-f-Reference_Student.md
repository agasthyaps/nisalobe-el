**Name:** **Date:**

**Chapter 1, “Keeping Up”**

- Cal and his father are walking along a red road. Pop begins to tell a story about being in a war.

- As Pop and Cal continue walking, Cal is mentally drawn back in time to the exact event about which Pop was talking. Pop calls Cal’s name, and Cal is pulled from the moment he was experiencing.

- Suddenly, Cal and Pop’s path is blocked by a large man on a white horse.

- Pop unties the kerchief around his neck to expose the paler skin of his neck and chest, proving they are not African American.

- Pop and the man talk about fighting in the war.

- Pop informs the man on the horse of his and Cal’s destination. The man on the horse, Red Campbell, allows Pop and Cal to pass.

- Red tells Pop and Cal to stop at his home and get some food from his wife, Rose.

- Pop asks if there is any work to be done in payment for the food, and Red agrees to Pop and Cal splitting wood.

**Chapter 2, “Not All That Much”**

- Cal and Pop complete their chores and are served a home-cooked meal by Rose.

- Pop and Cal continue to their destination in Rustburg.

- As Cal and Pop approach the house on the outskirts of Rustburg, Pop reads three signs signaling that travelers (hoboes) are not welcome.

- Pop tells Cal that they are going to try to set the situation right, and they cautiously approach the door.

- Pop and Cal gain entrance to the Euler household. Mrs. Euler is the widow of Samson Euler, who fought in the war with Pop.

- Will Black (Pop) asks Mrs. Euler if she has been having trouble with somebody stealing from her.

- When Pop finds out that the latest stolen item was taken only two days before, Cal realizes that he and Pop are going to do something about the thief.

**Chapter 3, “Tracking”**

- Pop and Cal set off to track the thief. They begin at the chicken coop and find boot prints to help their search.

- As Pop and Cal are tracking the thief, Pop tests Cal’s tracking skills by asking various questions along the way, based on the evidence the thief has left behind.

- Cal and Pop locate the thief, who is asleep in a makeshift tent.

- Pop wakes up the thief (Jack), confronts him about his actions, retrieves Mrs. Euler’s butcher knife and pot, and takes enough money from Jack to pay for the two stolen hens.

- Pop informs Jack that they will return tomorrow to be sure that he has left the area, and if Jack is not gone, then he will be sorry that he stayed around.
