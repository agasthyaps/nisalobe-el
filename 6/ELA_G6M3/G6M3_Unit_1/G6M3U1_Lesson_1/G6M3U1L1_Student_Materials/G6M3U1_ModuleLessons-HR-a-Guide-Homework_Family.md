Why were American Indian boarding schools first established?

- *American Indian boarding schools were established to assimilate Native Americans into white American culture through education and erasure of Native American identity.*

What kinds of experiences did students have at American Indian boarding schools? How did these experiences impact students?

- *Students may have experienced forced aesthetic changes (e.g., their hair was cut and their clothes were changed), linguistic changes (e.g., they were not allowed to use their Native American languages), and identity changes (e.g., their names were changed).*

- *Students may have experienced abuses or cruelty at the hands of the school’s administration.*

- *Students may have formed strong bonds with other students and exchanged tribal knowledge that actually strengthened their ties to their heritage (e.g., stomp dances, sweat lodges, language, oral tradition).*

What factors influence our identities?

- *Our peers, our school, our families, and our experiences can affirm or threaten our identities.*

- *Identities are dynamic and change in response to experience, awareness, and self-reflection.*

- *Identities are complicated and conflicting, and tensions may exist among our different identities.*

What will your student be doing at school?

At the beginning of Unit 1, students are introduced to the module topic, American Indian Boarding Schools, and the module’s anchor text, *Two Roads*. *Two Roads* is a historical fiction novel set during the Great Depression. Twelve-year-old Cal Black and his Pop, like many unemployed people of the time, travel by rail in search of honest work, following the hobo ethical code and living as “knights of the road.” Above all else, Cal and Pop adhere to the most important rule: I take care of you, you take care of me. But Cal’s sense of stability is jarred when Pop makes two shocking revelations: 1) Cal is not white as he has always identified, but is, in fact, half-Creek Indian; and 2) Pop will be enrolling Cal in an American Indian boarding school where he will stay as Pop marches on Washington, DC with other veterans demanding their promised payment for their service during World War I. Through the lens of a historical fiction novel, students will learn about the policies and attitudes that led to the opening of American Indian boarding schools in the United States, the experiences of the students, and the identity crisis faced by students as these schools attempted to strip them of their native culture.

Primary sources paired with the anchor text will help students to build deep content knowledge and engage in academic conversations about the topic and create connections to their own lives. Students examine the points of view of different authors, such as boarding school survivor Zitkala-Sa and boarding school founder Captain Richard Pratt, to understand the varying perspectives and attitudes towards this topic. In the context of the novel, the focus on point of view highlights the way that Cal’s view of the school, his peers, his father, and his identity develop over time, and as a response to different experiences. This study promotes the reflective thinking that helps students to examine their own experiences and points of view about their own identity. Students also integrate information from primary source photographs to practice working with multimedia resources and build their capacity to better understand a topic and then assess an author’s presentation of ideas.

Language use is a key marker of one’s identity. Characters in *Two Roads* engage in code-switching, or using a variety of language structures and vocabulary, depending on their purpose and audience. Students recognize how an author’s use of language varieties reveals something about a character and develops them as relatable figures.

Central to the EL Education curriculum is a focus on “habits of character” and social-emotional learning. Students work to become effective learners, developing mindsets and skills for success in college, career, and life (e.g., initiative, responsibility, perseverance, collaboration); work to become ethical people, treating others well and standing up for what is right (e.g., empathy, integrity, respect, compassion); and work to contribute to a better world, putting their learning to use to improve communities (e.g., citizenship, service).

In this unit, students work to become effective learners by showing responsibility with on-time completion of reading tasks. They work to become effective learners by showing perseverance as they read large portions of the text. Students work to become ethical people by showing empathy towards those who suffered as a result of their experiences in the American Indian boarding schools. They show compassion and respect towards their classmates, as the text brings up personal connections and reflections that may be difficult for others to share.

How can you support your student at home?

Read articles with your student that incorporate graphics or photographs. Talk to your student about the connection between the article and the visual element. Ask your student what further information about the article topic he/she can learn from the visual element.

Read versions of the same story that offer different points of view. Talk to your student about how the story changes based on the point of view from which the story is told.

Read the anchor text with your student. Occasionally, ask your student to retell the events of a chapter you’ve read together.

Talk to your student about his/her favorite character from a book, graphic novel, television show, or movie. Ask your student what attributes of that character makes the character his/her favorite.

Unit 1: Homework

In Lessons 2–15, homework handouts focus on analyzing language, point of view, and how sections of the text fit into the overall structure and develop the setting, plot, and characters. Additional practice with intensive pronouns and integrating information from photographs to help develop their understanding are also included. These are all literacy skills students learn during class; therefore, homework is designed to help students practice and apply skills they’ve already learned.

**Anchor Text reading:** Time limitations do not always allow for students to read entire chapters of *Two Roads* during class; therefore, students should preread a chapter for homework the night before it is studied in class. Reading from the anchor text will be balanced with independent research reading, which is used to deepen students’ background knowledge about the topic of the module.

**Research reading:** Your student is expected to independently research the topic of study in this module, American Indian boarding schools, by reading topic-related books of his or her choice. Research reading will be assigned on evenings when students are not already reading the anchor text. Students will be expected to read for approximately 20 minutes each day and respond to a prompt of choice in the front of the independent reading journal.

**Choice reading:** If your student would also like to independently read and respond to a book of free choice, he or she may use the back of the independent reading journal.

Independent Reading

**Directions:** Remember to record responses to research reading in the front of your independent reading journal and responses to choice reading in the back. Try to choose a different prompt each time.

Record any new vocabulary in your vocabulary log. Underline vocabulary found during independent reading.

Record:

- Date

- Title and author of your reading book

- Pages you have read

- Prompt

- Response

Example:

<u>Date:</u> January 14

<u>Book Title and Author</u>: *Two Roads* by Joseph Bruchac

<u>Pages Read:</u> 16–28

<u>Prompt:</u> Explain how the text relates to historical context across time periods and/or different events in history.

<u>Response:</u> Cal and Pop leave the home of Red. They continue down the road and come upon their intended destination. There are symbols scratched into a corner post that tell Pop and Cal hoboes are not welcome at the home. The signs that Cal and Pop are familiar with from their travels remind me of other signs in history that were posted to show how a group of people were not welcome. Establishments boldly posted signs such as “WHITE ONLY” or “COLORED SECTION” to call out who was welcome and where they were welcome. Cal and Pop’s situation is different because the signs they encounter are a reflection of their temporary station in life based on their social class and were posted by other hoboes as a warning about where it was safe to travel. In contrast, the other signs mentioned sorted people by race and reflected federal laws at the time that made racism legal. The signs were posted by people of one race as a threat towards people of another race not to risk integration in public places.

(Note: The example above uses *Two Roads* as the text in mention. The event mentioned in the example is from a section of the novel students do not read. Students will not be using the anchor text for their journal entries; students will respond to the writing prompts based on their chosen independent research text.)

Consider using the following independent reading prompts.[^1]

- How does this text add to your understanding of one of the guiding questions of the module?

- Which habits of character are demonstrated in the text? Explain.

- Which habits of character are NOT demonstrated in the text? Explain.

- Record two or three facts in your own words that you learned from the text.

- Summarize your research reading today in no more than five sentences.

- Explain a way in which you connect to the text.

- Explain how the text connects to another text you’ve read.

- Explain how the text connects to something currently happening in the world.

- Explain how the text connects to *Two Roads*.

- Explain how the text relates to the topic of American Indian boarding schools.

- Explain how the text relates to historical context across time periods and/or different events in history.

- Explain how excerpts from the text represent accurate historical context.

- Choose one new word from your reading today and analyze it on a vocabulary square.

|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Definition in your own words**                  | **Synonyms** (words with the same meaning) |
| **Words with the same affix or root**             | **Sketch**                                 |
| **Translation in home language** (if appropriate) |                                            |

Vocabulary

**Directions:** In the classroom, you have been recording words from your texts in your vocabulary log. Throughout this unit, you have been research reading topic-related books at home to build your knowledge of critical problems and design solutions and recording words in your independent reading journal.

Choose a word from your research reading or from a text you’ve read in class and add the word to your vocabulary log. Try to choose a different word to add and to practice a different vocabulary strategy each time. For each word, be sure to add the following:

1.  The definition, or meaning, of the word

<!-- -->

3.  The vocabulary strategy you used to figure out the meaning of the word

4.  A sketch or diagram that helps you to better understand the meaning of the word

Record new vocabulary in vocabulary logs and mark academic vocabulary with a symbol—for example, a star:

- Academic vocabulary: words you might find in informational texts on many different topics. For example, the words evidence and rationale are words that could be found in books on any topic.

- Domain-specific vocabulary: words about a particular topic. For example, the words *tadpoles*, *frogspawn*, and *amphibians* are some that would be found on the topic of frogs.

Vocabulary Strategies

As a reminder, the vocabulary strategies we’ve been working on in class are:

- Context: Read the sentence around the word.

- Look at the affixes for clues.

- Look at the root of the word for clues.

- Use a dictionary.

- Discuss the word with another person (after attempting some of the above strategies).

[^1]: Some of the prompts will not be appropriate for the text students are reading. Invite students to choose a prompt that works for the text they have just read.
