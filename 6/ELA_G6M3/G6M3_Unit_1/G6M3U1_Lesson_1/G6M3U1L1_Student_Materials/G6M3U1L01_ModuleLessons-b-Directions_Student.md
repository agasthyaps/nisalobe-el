**Name:** **Date:**

1.  With a partner, look at your starting resource (distributed by your teacher).

2.  Look carefully at the resource. Discuss it with your partner. Record what you notice (statements or observations) and what you wonder (questions) on your note-catcher.

3.  When the music begins, pass your resource in one direction around the circle. When the music stops, observe the new resource you have been handed. (If you ended up with a resource you and your partner have seen previously, quickly and quietly swap it with a nearby pair.)

4.  Complete steps 2 and 3 again.

5.  Continue this process until you have seen at least four resources.
