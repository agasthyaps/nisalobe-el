(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Write continuously for the entire time to answer the prompt. Use specific examples to support your thinking.

Based on the excerpts from chapter 1, what can you infer about Cal and Pop?

Answers will vary. Sample student response: Cal and Pop have a very close relationship. Cal says that they have no one else in the world but each other. They have to take care of one another, especially since they are traveling on the open road with no home. The reader can also infer that life is made more difficult by the assumptions people make about them based on the color of their skin. I can also infer that Cal likes to read. He says that he hopes to have a whole shelf full of books when they finally have a home again.
