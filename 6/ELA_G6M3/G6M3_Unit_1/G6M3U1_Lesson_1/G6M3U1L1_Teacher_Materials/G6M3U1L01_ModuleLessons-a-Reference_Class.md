"A great general has said that the only good Indian is a dead one. . .I agree with the sentiment, but only in this: that all the Indian there is in the race should be dead. Kill the Indian in him, and save the man . . . it would seem that the time may have arrived when we can very properly make at least the attempt to assimilate our two hundred and fifty thousand Indians. . .The school at Carlisle is an attempt on the part of the government to do this."

“. . . the provisions for the care of the Indian children in boarding schools are grossly inadequate. The outstanding deficiency is in the diet furnished the Indian children, many of whom are below normal health. The diet is deficient in quantity, quality, and variety. The effort has been made to feed the children on a per capita of eleven cents a day . . .”

“It was night when we reached the school grounds. The lights from the windows of the large buildings fell upon some of the icicled trees that stood beneath them. We were led toward an open door, where the brightness of the lights within flooded out over the heads of the excited palefaces who blocked the way. My body trembled more from fear than from the snow I trod upon . . . I had arrived in the wonderful land of rosy skies, but I was not happy, as I had thought I should be. My long travel and the bewildering sights had exhausted me. I fell asleep, heaving deep, tired sobs. My tears were left to dry themselves in streaks, because neither my aunt nor my mother was near to wipe them away.”

“I’ve been at Challagi Indian Industrial School two whole months now. The ‘noble mission of this fine institution’ is to help the Indian. I’ve now heard the superintendent say that more times than I can count. It is meant to teach the Indian a new modern way. To finally make him into a useful citizen after, as Superintendent Morrell puts it, ‘untold generations of meaningless savage life’. To give him a true, higher purpose. After the time I’ve spent here, though, it seems to me like the true purpose of this place is to wear the Indian out.”

Resource 6

“. . . I am missing our Creek gang. I belonged with them in a way I never belonged before. I miss the freedom of the woods and fields, the joking, the stomp dancing. I miss having learned I’m not just Indian. I’m Creek. Even though I’ve only known about it for a short time it’s like I’ve found a part of myself that was always there, but just hidden . . . It’s kind of like I’ve been growing up without ever having looked into a mirror and recognizing myself.”

Bruchac, Joseph. *Two Roads*. Penguin Young Readers, 2018. p. 298–299.

Resource 7

“Almost immediately our names were changed to those in common use in the English language. Instead of translating our names into English and calling Zinkcaziwin, Yellow Bird, and Wanbli K'lesk, Spotted Eagle, which in itself would have been educational, we were just John, Henry, or Maggie, as the case might  
be . . . we had been forbidden to speak our mother tongue, which is the rule in all boarding-schools. This rule is uncalled for, and today is not only robbing the Indian, but America of a rich heritage. The language of a people is part of their history. Today we should be perpetuating history instead of destroying it, and this can only be effectively done by allowing and encouraging the young to keep it alive.”
