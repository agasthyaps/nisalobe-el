**Voices of American Indian Boarding Schools Audio Museum**

Over the course of the module, students will have built a deeper understanding of early American Indian boarding schools and the experiences reported by the Native American students who attended them. These degrading and often abusive schools forced the acculturation of their students, aiming to erase tribal identities under the guise of education. The impact of these schools, though profoundly felt among the school’s attendees, has gone largely unacknowledged in mainstream narratives of North American history.

In this performance task, the Voices of American Indian Boarding Schools audio museum, students will act as witnesses to this time period by organizing an audio museum to highlight the experiences and amplify the voices of American Indian boarding school students. This performance task has six steps, including preparatory steps that overlap with the End of the Unit 3 Assessment:

1.  First, students select from a carefully curated list of primary source texts (poems, songs, journal entries, and personal narratives) written by students of American Indian boarding schools.

2.  Then, students write two accompanying pieces: (a) a preface, introducing their selected piece and situating it in history by providing context about its content, author, etc.; and (b) a brief reflection, which explains why they selected this piece to share at the Community Museum event, what the piece means to them, and why it is important to highlight the stories of American Indian boarding school students in general.

3.  Students practice rehearsing these pieces aloud with classmates, ensuring appropriate pacing, volume, and intonation.

4.  As part of the End of Unit 3 Assessment, students use recording software to record themselves reading aloud their prefaces, their selected pieces, and their reflections. After giving and receiving peer feedback, students record a more polished final version of their work.

5.  At the audio museum event, which takes place in the lesson immediately following the end of unit assessment, students share their polished recordings with a larger audience, which may include their classmates, students from other classes, parents, community members, etc. Each student designs a “listening station” at which visitors—scanning QR codes, using headphones, or listening to links on their own phones—can hear the stories of American Indian Boarding School students.

6.  After sharing and engaging with one another’s recordings at the audio museum, students participate in an informal discussion with their classmates. The purpose of this discussion is to reflect on the experience of the performance task, draw explicit connections between the performance task and the module overall, and synthesize and celebrate learning.

Format

Students create short audio presentations, recorded individually and then shared via listening stations at a public audio museum event. Each audio recording contains a student-written preface and reflection and a student-selected text read aloud.

Standards Addressed through This Task

The performance tasks at the end of every module are neither formative nor summative assessments. They are not formative since they come at the end of the module, concluding students’ learning about the module topic and the literacy skills they have built over eight or nine weeks. However, they are also not summative because they are heavily scaffolded to help students create high-quality work, and so are not a strong measure of what students can do independently. For these reasons, we do not recommend analyzing performance tasks with the same lens you might use to analyze assessments. Consider looking at students’ performance tasks through the lens of the attributes of high-quality student work (authenticity, complexity, craftsmanship). Below are possible questions to keep in mind when considering these attributes:

- **Authenticity:** If the student excerpted their selection from a longer text, were they careful to preserve the original meaning, style, and intent? Do students use intonation, pausing, and other speaking features to reflect the tone of the text they selected? Are students’ reflections candid, honest, and individual?

- **Complexity:** Did the student carefully consider what context is most important to share with their audience in the preface of their recording? Did the student produce thoughtful personal reflections that use evidence from the text, the module, or other learning to describe the impact of the text? Do students use thoughtful, precise, and appropriate vocabulary and grammatical structures to convey their ideas?

- **Craftsmanship:** Did the student appropriately adjust their language (i.e., their wording, volume, and intonation) to match the purpose of each section? If the student excerpted their selection from a longer text, did they do so with thoughtful attention to the most powerful lines? Did they record their preface with an informative tone or style? Their text with an emotional one? Their reflection with a personal one?

The following standards are addressed, but not assessed:

- **W.6.10:** Write routinely over extended time frames (time for research, reflection, and revision) and shorter time frames (a single sitting or a day or two) for a range of discipline-specific tasks, purposes, and audiences.

- **SL.6.1d:** Review the key ideas expressed and demonstrate understanding of multiple perspectives through reflection and paraphrasing.

- **SL.6.6:** Adapt speech to a variety of contexts and tasks, demonstrating command of formal English when indicated or appropriate. (See grade 6 Language standards 1 and 3 for specific expectations.)

- **L.6.3:** Use knowledge of language and its conventions when writing, speaking, reading, or listening.

- **L.6.6:** Acquire and use accurately grade-appropriate general academic and domain-specific words and phrases; gather vocabulary knowledge when considering a word or phrase important to comprehension or expression.

Student-Friendly Writing Invitation/Task Description

Throughout this module, you have been learning about American Indian boarding schools. Despite their legacy and impact, these schools have been neglected in traditional narratives of American history. To honor those who experienced this injustice, you will participate in an “audio museum” called **Voices of American Indian Boarding Schools**. This audio museum is meant to amplify the voices of the survivors of the boarding schools.

**What Is an “Audio Museum”?**

A museum of audio recordings. Usually, when we visit museums, we use our eyes to look at art or exhibits or other visual displays. In the Voices of American Indian Boarding Schools Audio Museum, we will use our ears.

**Before the Audio Museum**

First, you will select a text (a poem, personal narrative, etc.) written by a survivor of the boarding schools. This text should mean something to you; it should be impactful.

You will write a preface for the text that introduces it and provides context. You will also write a reflection that explains why the text is meaningful.

During your end of unit assessment, you will record yourself reading your preface, text, and reflection aloud. You will act as the voice of its author and create space for the author’s words to be shared with a broader audience.

**During the Audio Museum**

We as a class will host the Voices of American Indian Boarding Schools Audio Museum. Each of you will have a “listening station” where classmates and visitors can listen to your recordings and learn more about the experiences of students at American Indian boarding schools.

You will listen to the recordings of your classmates during this time. You will answer questions about three classmates’ recordings on a note-catcher.

After the audio museum, we will have a discussion as a whole class. We will talk about the connections between the performance task and the module overall.

Through our work before and at the audio museum, we can help make sure that these powerful stories about American Indian boarding schools are exposed to a wider audience.

Below are key criteria students need to address when completing this task. Specific lessons during the module build in opportunities for students to understand the criteria, offer additional criteria, and work with their teacher to construct a criteria list by which their work will be critiqued and formally assessed.

Your contribution to the audio museum will include:

- A text selected from a curated list of primary sources.

- A prepared preface to the text, situating the text within a broader context and including any background information necessary to understand the text.

- A well-rehearsed oral reading of the text, presented with appropriate volume, pausing, and intonation during the recording.

- Adjustments to your voice to match the purpose and the audience, demonstrating appropriate respect and thoughtfulness for the task.

- A prepared reflection after the reading, demonstrating an understanding of diverse perspectives and explaining the text’s impact on the student.

Options for Students

- Consider collaborating with a classmate to produce a recording together (e.g., by taking turns reading line by line a longer text).

- Think about other ways to make your recording engaging and meaningful. You might wish to include gentle background music to play while you share your reflection, for example. Check with your teacher to see how you might increase the impact of your recording while still demonstrating respect for the words of your chosen text.

Options for Teachers

- Extensions written into Module 3, Unit 3 lessons take into account widely varying technological resources in classrooms. Explore options carefully and choose what is best for your classroom and students.

- Set a purpose and plan for sifting through the many readings by asking students what about the American Indian boarding school experience they most want to convey to the audience. Prompt students to look for that particular element as they are reading and selecting a text to share.

- Leverage local resources by reaching out to a nearby historical society or, if available, Indian reservation to provide information about Native Americans who lived in the area. For maximum impact, arrange for a guest contributor from such an organization to record their own contribution to the audio museum.

- One aim of this performance task is to help students make heard and known the stories of students who attended American Indian Boarding Schools. To heighten the impact of students’ work and broaden the audience who will benefit from the students’ work, consider making the recordings available as a resource for other students (i.e., by providing copies of recordings in the school library or sharing them with a local historical organization).
