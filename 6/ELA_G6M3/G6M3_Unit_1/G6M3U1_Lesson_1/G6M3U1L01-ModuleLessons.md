Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RL.6.1 – Work Time A: Students participate in the Infer the Topic protocol and engage with literary resources (e.g., excerpts from the anchor text) related to the topic of the module.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time A: Students participate in the Infer the Topic protocol and engage with informational texts (e.g., excerpts from historical documents) related to the topic of the module.

- SL.6.2 – Work Time A: Students collaborate during the Infer the Topic protocol, integrating information presented in diverse media and explaining its relationship to the topic of the module.

- Students are introduced to the module anchor text, *Two Roads*, in Work Time C. Be aware that the topic presented in the book, American Indian boarding schools, may be sensitive for students, and that some students may connect with these issues personally and deeply. After exploring the text, students have time to reflect. Monitor students and determine if there are issues surfacing that need to be discussed in more detail as a whole group, in smaller groups, or independently. Be aware that reflections may be personal, and students are not required to share them. Consider providing background information and discussion on the treatment of American Indians by the US government as necessary.

- The Smithsonian Museum of the American Indian, the Carlisle Indian School Digital Resource Center at Dickinson College, and the author Joseph Bruchac were consulted in the naming of this module’s topic – American Indian Boarding Schools. Within indigenous communities, discussions of preferred terminology (i.e., American Indian versus Native American) are ongoing, and vast diversity across communities means that reaching consensus about terminology cannot and should not be a goal. For this reason, the title of this module should be considered changeable, not prescriptive. Invite students’ input and encourage discussion about naming practices, emphasizing the importance of calling people what they wish to be called. As a way to demonstrate respect for diversity, aim to be as precise as possible when discussing indigenous groups. For example, the main character of the anchor text *Two Roads*, Cal, describes himself as *Creek Indian* and, thus, is referred to as such in lessons and students’ materials.

- This lesson is the first that includes built-out instruction for the use of Goal 4 Conversation Cues. Goal 4 Conversation Cues help students think with others to expand the conversation. Refer to the Online Resources for the complete set of cues. Examples of the Goal 4 Conversation Cues used in this module include:

- To prompt students to compare:

“How is what \_\_\_\_\_ said the same as/different from what \_\_\_\_\_ said?”

- To prompt students to agree, disagree, and explain why:

“Do you agree or disagree with what your classmate said? Why?”

- To prompt students to add on to classmates’ comments:

“Who can add on to what your classmate said?”

- To prompt students to explain:

“Who can explain why your classmate came up with that response?”

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- In addition to the resources provided for the Infer the Topic protocol, consider adding other resources such as videos, music, graphics, historical documents, or picture books related to the module topic.

- Chapters 1–4 in the anchor text will not be read in their entirety during class time due to time constraints. Students may wish to read these chapters outside of class and should be encouraged to do so.

- In chapter 1, the narrator Cal refers to himself and his Pop as “knights of the road” or “hoboes.” The term “hobo” generally holds a negative connotation today and can be used as an insult, though the term historically referred to migratory workers, who traveled from place to place, often by rail, seeking honest work. Many people were forced to become “hoboes” during the 1930s as the Great Depression left them without homes or jobs, as is the case in the anchor text, *Two Roads*. Consider inviting students to participate in an extension activity in which they serve as “linguistic investigators” to track the evolution of this word. Students can use online dictionaries (including etymological dictionaries), encyclopedias, search engines, articles, etc. to explore former and current interpretations of the word, including its general perception today. Provide these, or other questions, to guide students’ queries:

- When was the term *hobo* first used?

- What kind of people did this word originally describe? What did they do? What did they look like?

- Who uses the word *hobo* today? Why do they use this word?

- How does the word *hobo* make you feel when you hear it?

- What are other similar words or phrases that could be used instead without hurting people’s feelings?

- This exercise reinforces student work with W.6.7 and W.6.8, which were assessed during Module 2. It also provides space for students to understand the way in which language changes and can become weaponized. Students can apply this learning to their understanding of other more painful or charged terms they may encounter in *Two Roads* or other texts.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- This module builds on skills practiced in previous modules, specifically in students’ ability to determine an author’s point of view or purpose in a text and explain how it is conveyed as they did in Module 1 and identify a central idea of a text and include it in an effective summary as they did in Module 2.

Support All Students

- Integrated ELL supports are marked throughout lessons with a ▲. These teaching suggestions support student comprehension without disrupting lesson flow or requiring extensive class time or additional materials. Deeper, high-leverage supports, designed to accelerate ELLs’ language development, can be found in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson.

- Note that there is a differentiated version of the I Notice/I Wonder note-catcher used in Work Time A. Differentiated versions of some materials are available in most lessons as a way to provide additional support to ELLs. As the Infer the Topic protocol in this lesson is a collaborative exercise, consider pairing students who need heavier support and working with them to complete the differentiated note-catchers. If feasible, it may also be strategic to create home-language pairs and allow students to use their home language as a resource to help them interpret content and develop inferences during Work Time A. ▲

- Students may need additional support reading the text excerpts in the Infer the Topic protocol. Invite students to help each other by reading the excerpts aloud to each other. ▲

- Consider pairing English language learners with a partner who has more advanced or native language proficiency. The partner with greater language proficiency can serve as a model in the pair, initiating discussions and providing implicit sentence frames, for example. ▲

- Students may lack the background knowledge needed to make informed inferences based on the images and quotes they see during the Infer the Topic protocol. Remind students that inferences need to be evidence-driven; in other words, any inference made should explicitly reference the content of the resources they examine.

- If any students have visual barriers, consider presenting the Infer the Topic resources in large typeface.

- Beginning a new text may be intimidating or challenging for developing readers. Work Time B introduces students to the text through short excerpts that spark interest and require minimal reading. ▲

- The anchor text, *Two Roads*, is set in the 1930s; as a result, some characters use terms that may be seen as derogatory or offensive today. For example, Cal refers to African-Americans as “Negroes” in early chapters of the text. Explain to students that this is a dated and derogatory term reflective of the time period in which the novel takes place. Invite frank discussion about whether the class feels comfortable hearing the word read aloud or not, and remind students that the term should not be used otherwise.

- Pre-reading new texts can be a valuable exercise for slower or struggling readers. Consider presenting students with the Unit 1 reading schedule ahead of time and encourage them to skim and scan new chapters the night before to acquaint themselves with the content.

- To support ELLs, this lesson uses short passages and engaging images to introduce a new module topic, which students infer through an interactive protocol. This lesson’s slight variation to the protocol format, which invites students to work in pairs and examine resources one at a time, scaffolds the protocol and reduces cognitive overload for ELLs. Also in this lesson, a new anchor text is launched. *Two Roads* tells the story of Cal, a smart and sensitive boy, making sense of himself and the world around him within the context of the fictional Challagi Indian Industrial School. To spark student interest in this novel and to reduce the amount of reading expected on the first day of a new module, students listen to short excerpts read aloud before digging into the text more independently later in the unit.

- ELLs may find it challenging to interpret some of the language of the excerpts used during the Infer the Topic protocol, as many of these excerpts are drawn from historical texts or highly stylized narratives. Invite students to engage with the resources in whatever way makes sense for them (e.g., by noticing familiar words and generating inferences based on those words alone). In this lesson, ELLs may also find it challenging to begin a new anchor text, especially if they struggled to complete the anchor texts of Modules 1 and 2. Throughout the module, continue to encourage students to use provided chapter summaries to reinforce or verify their understanding of the text’s key events. Locate opportunities throughout the module to celebrate reading milestones and generate motivation to continue through the text.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.3, 6.I.B.5, and 6.I.B.6.

Assessment Guidance

- Monitor students’ Infer the Topic: I Notice/I Wonder note-catchers to ensure they are on the right track for inferring what the module is about at the end of the Infer the Topic protocol.

- Consider numbering the resources and asking students to record the number of the resource next to their notices and wonderings to make the connections among them clearer.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will spend some time discussing their reflections on the module guiding questions. They will continue in the anchor text, *Two Roads*, picking up with the story at the end of chapter 4 and begin tracking how the main character, Cal, responds to and changes as a result of plot events.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.6.1 (5 minutes)

- Direct students’ attention to the posted learning target and select a volunteer to read it aloud:

“I can infer the topic of this module from resources.”

- Remind students that they have seen the same learning target in previous modules. Explain that today’s lesson is the first of a new module.

- Pair students with a partner and ask them to label themselves A and B. Distribute the text ***Two Roads***.

- Tell students they will now spend 2 minutes looking through their new anchor text with their partner and discussing what they notice and wonder about *Two Roads*. Partner B will share a notice (statement) or a wonder (question) first, and then partner A, and then partner B again, and so on. Prompt students to read the dust jacket, chapter titles, character list, and the author’s biography.

- After 3 minutes, refocus whole group. Clarify that the novel is historical fiction; while the main character is fictional, his experiences represent a true and painful part of American history. Direct students to the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**, and focus on the habits of respect and compassion.

Work Time

A. Infer the Topic – RI.6.1, SL6.2 (10 minutes)

- Remind students that they have launched the past two modules using the Infer the Topic protocol. Explain that they will use a slightly different protocol this time with the same objective – to determine the topic of the module by making inferences about a number of resources.

- Strategically group students into pairs, then direct the class to form a large circle. Distribute a single **Directions for Infer the Topic, Infer the Topic resources**, and the **Infer the Topic: I Notice/I Wonder note-catcher** or the optional **Infer the Topic: I Notice/I Wonder note-catcher** ▲ to each pair. Explain that, just as in previous modules, students will record their notices and wonderings about each resource on the note-catcher. However, instead of the resources being posted, pairs will hold one resource and base their observations on the resource they have been assigned. Cue students to begin passing their resource around the circle by playing music. When the music stops, pairs should have a new resource in their hands. Direct partners to repeat the process, recording their notices and wonderings on their note-catcher. If partners have a resource they have seen previously, they can quickly and quietly swap it with a nearby pair.

- Focus students on the question at the top of the note-catcher and read it aloud:

“What do you think you will be learning about in this module?”

- Tell students that the purpose of the note-catcher is to take notes to help them remember their thinking. It isn’t something they will hand in for assessment, so they can record in pictures or words. They do not need to write in full sentences.

- Guide students through the protocol. Encourage students to agree or disagree with one another about what the resource means using sentence frames. Examples: “I agree because \_\_\_\_\_.” “I disagree because\_\_\_\_\_.”

- After students have swapped at least four times, refocus whole group. Think-Pair-Share:

“Now that you have looked at some resources, what do you think this module might be about?” (Responses will vary, but could include: Schools built specifically for educating Native Americans to be more “civilized,” i.e., White.)

- Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target, using a checking for understanding technique. Scan student responses and make a note of students who might need support. Check in with them moving forward.

For Lighter Support

- If it is feasible to do so, host individual reading check-ins with ELLs who need lighter support before they begin the Module 3 anchor text. During these meetings, work with students to compare their experiences reading the Module 1 and Module 2 anchor texts. Help them articulate their progress as independent readers and refine their reading goals for this module. Work with students to develop action plans for working toward their goals. Plan to meet with students again at the end of the module to track their progress and adjust goals as needed. This process supports a growth mindset and facilitates opportunities for students to take charge of their own learning.

For Heavier Support

- If it is feasible to do so, host individual reading check-ins with ELLs who need heavier support before they begin the Module 3 anchor text. Before these meetings, create a list of clear and specific statements that students can use to help them pinpoint their strengths and areas of growth. Students can use a 1–5 scale to express the extent to which they believe the statements apply to them. These statements might include:

- I enjoy reading novels in English.

- I enjoy reading novels in other languages.

- I can usually use context to understand the meaning of a new word.

- I understand more when I read silently than when I read aloud.

- I prefer to read alone than to read with others.

- I usually understand a text better when I read it a second time.

- During Work Time A, invite students who need heavier support to use the Infer the Topic: I Notice/I Wonder note-catcher ▲. This resource features images to support students’ notices and wonders.

Work Time

B. Introduce the Performance Task and Module Guiding Questions (10 minutes)

- Direct students’ attention to the **Performance Task anchor chart** and read the task aloud.

- As students may be overwhelmed by the Performance Task anchor chart, assure them that they will continue to explore the meaning of the chart in subsequent lessons and units.

- Turn and Talk:

“What do you notice?” (We will be recording ourselves speak the personal reflections of Native Americans.)

“What do you wonder?” (Responses will vary, but may include: What is an audio museum?)

“Now that you have analyzed the performance task, has your inference of what this module might be about changed? How?” (Responses will vary.)

- Clarify anything pertinent to this specific performance task. Consider displaying a model performance task from a former student. Ask students to make connections between the model and the performance task. Refer to the Performance Task Overview for more detailed explanations.

- Direct students’ attention to the **Module Guiding Questions anchor chart** and read the questions aloud.

“Why were American Indian boarding schools first established?”

“What kinds of experiences did students have at American Indian boarding schools? How did these experiences impact students?”

“What factors influence our identities?”

- Underline the word *identities*. Turn and Talk:

“What does this mean? What makes up a person’s identity?” (Answers will vary, but may include: one’s culture, language, gender, ethnicity, religion, and/or values.)

- Explain that students will return to this question throughout the module; they do not need to have a complete answer yet.

- Add the new words to the **academic word wall**, including translations in home languages. ▲

- Tell students that these are the questions that will guide their thinking and learning throughout the module. Turn and Talk:

“What do you notice?” (Responses will vary, but may include: It seems like American Indian boarding schools are in some way connected to identity.)

“What do you wonder?” (Responses will vary, but may include: Why did American Indian boarding schools exist? Do they still exist today?)

“Now that you have analyzed the guiding questions and performance task, has your inference of what this module might be about changed?” (Responses will vary.)

- Cue students to compare the ideas of their classmates:

“How is what \_\_\_\_\_ said the same as/different from what \_\_\_\_\_ said? I’ll give you time to think and write.” (Responses will vary.)

- Clarify that this module will be about American Indian boarding schools, specifically why they were established, what experiences students had there, and how these experiences impacted students. Students will build their understanding of this topic through the historical fiction novel, *Two Roads* by Joseph Bruchac.

- Turn and Talk:

“What does this topic mean to you at this point? Why might it be meaningful to study this topic?” (Responses will vary, but may include: This is a piece of American history about which we don’t often learn.)

“From what you know so far, what are you looking forward to about this topic?” (Responses will vary, but may include: Learning more about Native Americans in the 20th century, as usually we only learn about how early American pilgrims interacted with Native Americans.)

- Acknowledge that some students may already know something about this topic. Explain that for homework, they will reflect on the guiding questions and how they feel about them based on their own experiences, and that this will be discussed more at the beginning of the next lesson. And note that some students may know nothing about the topic—it will be fun to dig in together!

For Lighter Support

- If it is feasible to do so, host individual reading check-ins with ELLs who need lighter support before they begin the Module 3 anchor text. During these meetings, work with students to compare their experiences reading the Module 1 and Module 2 anchor texts. Help them articulate their progress as independent readers and refine their reading goals for this module. Work with students to develop action plans for working toward their goals. Plan to meet with students again at the end of the module to track their progress and adjust goals as needed. This process supports a growth mindset and facilitates opportunities for students to take charge of their own learning.

For Heavier Support

- If it is feasible to do so, host individual reading check-ins with ELLs who need heavier support before they begin the Module 3 anchor text. Before these meetings, create a list of clear and specific statements that students can use to help them pinpoint their strengths and areas of growth.

- I enjoy reading novels in other languages.

- I can usually use context to understand the meaning of a new word.

- I understand more when I read silently than when I read aloud.

- I prefer to read alone than to read with others.

- I usually understand a text better when I read it a second time.

Work Time

C. Launch the Text: *Two Roads*, Chapter 1 Excerpts – RL.6.1 (15 minutes)

- Refocus students on the anchor text. Explain that rather than read the entire first chapter, students will read several short excerpts from chapter 1 as their introduction to the main character, Cal, and his father, Pop.

- Invite students to turn to page 7. Read the following excerpts as students read along silently. Note that while students may read in small groups or individually in future lessons, students will benefit from this initial introduction to the text as a whole class.

- Smoothly connect each of the excerpts; assure students that they will still be able to form an initial impression of the main characters, their relationship, and the setting even without reading every word of chapter 1.

- Page 7 starting at the beginning of the chapter and ending at page 8, “ . . . leaving it behind.”

- Page 9 starting at “I’m so lost . . . ” and ending at page 9, “All we have is each other.”

- Page 10 starting at “I feel the weight . . . ” and ending at page 11, “ . . . good for a cough.”

- Page 12 starting at “‘Where-all you boys . . . ‘“ and ending at page 13 “ . . . are not treated fair.”

- Page 14 starting at “He gestures down . . . ” and ending at page 15 “ . . . *Run or Rule You*.”

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What happened?” (Twelve-year-old Cal and his Pop are traveling by foot from place to place as hoboes without a home. Pop has a memory from his time serving during WWI. Cal explains that he loves to read but can only carry a few books in his backpack. They meet a man on the road and offer to exchange labor for a meal. Cal references the ethical code held by knights of the road.)

- Invite a student to paraphrase the key points in more comprehensible language for those who need heavier support. ▲

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What is the gist? What is this part of the book mostly about?” (Twelve-year-old Cal and his father, Pop, have been riding the rails as “knights of the road,” or hoboes, since they lost their farm in the Great Depression and Cal’s mother died.)

- Record this on the **Gist anchor chart:** ***Two Roads***. Distribute **sticky notes**. Direct students to record the chapter number and the gist, and stick it at the front of the chapter, as they have done with previous anchor texts. Refer to the following resources as appropriate to support this section of the lesson: **Gist anchor chart:** ***Two Roads*** **(example for teacher reference), vocabulary logs, chapter synopsis**, and Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- In Work Time C, allocate time for students to examine the anchor text before listening to short excerpts read aloud. Provide questions to help orient students to the text. These questions could include:

- “Go to the copyright page at the beginning of the text. When was this text written? Now, find the page where Part 1 begins. When does this story take place?”

- “Go to the Characters page at the beginning of the text. What do you notice or wonder about the names and descriptions of the characters?”

- “Scan the text to find the titles of the chapters. How many chapters are in the text? What words do you recognize in the chapter titles? What questions do you have about the words?”

Closing and Assessment

A. QuickWrite: Character Inferences – RL.6.1 (5 minutes)

- Distribute **QuickWrite: Character Inferences**, and read aloud the prompt at the top:

- “Based on the excerpts from chapter 1, what can you infer about Cal and Pop?”

- Repeat or rephrase the prompt as necessary. Direct students to begin writing and to write continuously for the whole time.

- After 4 minutes, collect the QuickWrite to review later for any misconceptions.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Read and Reflect

- Students will read and reflect on the guiding questions for the module and discuss them with their families. They should consider how the guiding questions make them feel. They can sketch or write about their ideas.
