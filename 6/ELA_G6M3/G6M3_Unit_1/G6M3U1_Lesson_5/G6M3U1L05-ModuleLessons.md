Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.6.1 – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they use textual evidence from an excerpt of the Meriam Report to answer questions about the report.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time B: Students participate in a Jigsaw protocol in which they read excerpts of the Meriam Report and use textual evidence to support their analysis of what they read.

- RI.6.2 – Work Time B: During the Jigsaw protocol, students discuss key ideas in their text excerpts.

- RI.6.6 – Work Time B: During the Jigsaw protocol, students examine the point of view of the author of the Meriam Report.

- RI.6.4 – Work Time B: During the Jigsaw protocol, students interpret the meaning of words as they are used in their text excerpts.

- RI.6.5 – Work Time B: During the Jigsaw protocol, students collaborate to consider the ways in which individual short excerpts from the Meriam Report contribute to the overall development of key ideas in the text.

- SL.6.1d – Work Time B: During the Jigsaw protocol, students collaborate to review and reflect on the key ideas expressed in their text excerpts.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time C: Students use evidence from their excerpts to answer questions on the Analyze Point of View: Meriam Report note-catchers.

- RI.6.6 – Work Time C: Students analyze the author’s point of view in the Meriam Report and add to their Analyze Point of View: Meriam Report note-catchers.

- SL.6.1d – Work Time C: During the Jigsaw share, students collaborate to review and reflect on the key ideas expressed in their text excerpts.

- RI.6.6 – Closing and Assessment A: Students compare the point of view of the author of the Meriam Report to the authors of other texts read earlier in the unit.

- In this lesson, students first read excerpts from *The Problem of Indian Administration*; they will revisit these and other excerpts of this extensive document throughout this module. Note that this document will be referred to by its more well-known, colloquial moniker the “Meriam Report,” named after Lewis Meriam, who was commissioned to write the report in 1928.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- An optional Mini Language Dive, intended for use after Work Time B, is available in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- The Meriam Report is a vast document outlining the results of an extensive survey conducted in the early 20th century to track the economic, health, and living conditions of Native Americans. If time is available to do so, consider expanding the Background task of Work Time A to include the entire abstract, as well as the “Letter of Transmittal” that precedes the report itself. The Letter of Transmittal further details the methods for conducting the survey and directly explains the objectives of the report. A deeper exploration of this letter may support students’ understanding of the purpose of the Meriam Report, which in turn would inform their understanding of the author’s point of view.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the two previous lessons, students analyzed the point of view of Captain Pratt in an excerpt from one of his speeches and of Zitkala-Sa in her first-person narrative, “The Land of Red Apples.” With reduced scaffolding in this lesson, students continue to develop their abilities to examine the author’s point of view in the Meriam Report. During Closing and Assessment A of this lesson, students compare the point of view of the author of the Meriam Report to the points of view of Pratt and Zitkala-Sa.

Support All Students

- Students read excerpts from the Meriam Report, a document which detailed many of the abuses that were taking place at American Indian boarding schools. It may be upsetting for these students to read about the ways in which students were treated at these institutions. Point out that this was a commissioned report that brought many of these abuses to light. Invite them to speculate about ways in which things may have improved as a result of this report.

- To support ELLs, this lesson helps students build context to tackle a challenging primary-source document, *The Problem of Indian Administration*, more popularly known as the “Meriam Report.” Students participate in a Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol to answer preliminary questions about the text’s author, audience, and purpose and to gain multiple perspectives through partner interaction. Students are then guided through a Jigsaw protocol to read carefully curated excerpts of the Meriam Report. Jigsaw protocols limit the amount of reading expected of each student, honing students’ attention to relevant information and reducing cognitive overload. The questions that students answer on their Jigsaw: Meriam Report task cards are structurally identical to some of the selected response questions on the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment of Lesson 7. Collaborating with classmates to tackle similar questions ahead of time is supportive of all students, including ELLs, for whom practice and repetition may be especially beneficial.

- ELLs may find it challenging to process the content of one of the Meriam Report excerpts: Excerpt D highlights the challenges of ELLs in American Indian boarding schools and criticizes the schools’ “uniform curriculum” for not taking into account the language needs of students who do not speak English. These ideas may be resonant for ELLs; deeper exploration of the excerpt may be appropriate. If time permits, implement a writing activity that creates space for ELLs to react to these excerpts without having to publicly report their personal experiences. A writing prompt for this activity could be, “When I read Excerpt D, I feel \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ because \_\_\_\_\_\_\_.”

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.2, 6.I.B.5, 6.I.B.6, and 6.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- As students fill in their task cards during Work Time B, note that some responses may vary and others only have one correct answer. Ensure that unless there is one expected correct answer, such as a vocabulary word definition, students come to the correct conclusions about their assigned excerpts, even if they use different wording than the sample student response.

- Remind students to situate point of view in the context of a topic. Their responses to point of view on their note-catchers should explain the author’s point of view towards a specific topic or issue.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students examine photos that depict some of the problems described in the Meriam Report excerpts that students read during this lesson. Then, in preparation for the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment of Lesson 7, they practice integrating the information from the excerpts with information from the photos to develop a more cohesive understanding of the topic as a whole. In Unit 2, students return to the Meriam Report, participating in a close read of another critical section from the extensive document.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- As needed, review the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol from the Classroom Protocols document located on the Tools page (http://eled.org/tools).

- Prepare students for the Jigsaw protocol:

- Review the Jigsaw protocol to ensure clear directions and smooth transitions.

- Strategically group students into home groups of four, and then assign each student in the home group a letter—A, B, C, or D. The lettered groups will be the expert groups during the Jigsaw, with each expert group reading one of the four excerpts from the Meriam Report.

- Prepare copies of handouts for students (see Materials list).

- Print out copies of Jigsaw: Meriam Report task cards and cut up task cards prior to the lesson. Give each student only one Task Card for the group (A–D) that they are in.

- Carefully read each of the Meriam Report excerpts and review the examples for teacher reference to become familiar with what students will need to know and be able to do.

- Review the student tasks and example answers to get familiar with what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Prepare copies of handouts for students, including entrance ticket (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.6.1 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 5**. Refer to the Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 5 (example for teacher reference) for possible responses. Students will also need their anchor text, ***Two Roads***.

- Using a preferred classroom routine, collect or review the answers to **Homework: Analyze Language and Point of View: “Iron Routine.”** Refer to **Homework: Analyze Language and Point of View: “Iron Routine” (answers for teacher reference)**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar to or the same as previous lessons. Invite students to choose a habit of character focus for themselves for this lesson.

Work Time

A. Background: Meriam Report – RI.6.1 (5 minutes)

- Distribute **Background: Meriam Report**. Explain that the handout contains an abstract of the Meriam Report itself, to which students were just introduced in the Afterword of *Two Roads*. Tell students that they are going to build their understanding of the Meriam Report by reading this passage and participating in a Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol.

- Read the passages aloud as students follow along. Call on a student to paraphrase the passage by giving a general definition of the Meriam Report.

- Ensure students understand the directions for back-to-back and face-to-face. (Refer to the Classroom Protocols document located on the Tools page: http://eled.org/tools for the full version of the protocol.) Use **Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face: Meriam Report (for teacher reference)** to guide students through the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol.

- Circulate and monitor student responses during the protocol. Make note of students who might need support and check in with them moving forward. Give additional time and attention to any terms with which students struggle.

For Lighter Support

- Monitor pairs during the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol of Work Time A and strategically use combinations of Conversation Cues to deepen the thinking of students who need lighter support. For example:

- “Can you say more about that?” (Goal 1)

- “Can you tell me what your partner said in your own words?” (Goal 2)

- “Can you explain why your partner came up with that language?” (Goal 4)

- Before Work Time A, for further practice with the intonation strategies introduced during the Mini Language Dive of Lesson 2, encourage students who need lighter support to read aloud the wh- questions on the Jigsaw: Meriam Report task cards and identify their intonation patterns. Invite students to begin to compile a “Question Intonation anchor chart” that tracks the intonation patterns of different question types (e.g., yes/no questions → rising intonation; *or* questions → rising/falling intonation; *wh-* questions → falling intonation). Display this resource in future activities that require students to ask or answer questions aloud.

For Heavier Support

- Monitor pairs during the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol of Work Time A and strategically use combinations of Conversation Cues to help students who need heavier support understand one another and build off of each other’s responses. For example:

- “So do you mean \_\_\_?” (Goal 1)

- “Can you repeat what your partner said?” (Goal 2)

- “Do you agree or disagree with what your partner said? Why?” (Goal 4)

- Before Work Time A, for further practice with the intonation strategies introduced during the Mini Language Dive of Lesson 2, read aloud the *wh-* questions on the Jigsaw: Meriam Report task cards and invite students who need heavier support to repeat after you and practice the falling intonation associated with *wh-* questions. Help them compare the intonation of these questions with the intonation of other questions, such as

- “Did you read the text?” (rising intonation)

- “Are you part of Group A or Group B?” (rising/falling intonation)

Work Time

B. Jigsaw: Meriam Report – RI.6.6 (15 minutes)

- Explain that students will now dig into the Meriam Report further, becoming an expert on one passage from the report using the Jigsaw protocol.

- Review the Jigsaw procedure: Students have home groups and expert groups. They will first work with their expert groups to read and answer questions about a short excerpt from the Meriam Report. Then, they will share what they learned with their home groups and also learn about the other groups’ texts.

- Display home group (e.g., ABCD) and expert group (e.g., AAAA; BBBB; CCCC; DDDD) assignments. Have students move into their expert groups. Group(s) A will read excerpt A from **Jigsaw: Meriam Report**, Group(s) B will read excerpt B, Group(s) C will read excerpt C, and Group(s) D will read excerpt D.

- Once students are settled in their expert groups, distribute Jigsaw: Meriam Report and **Jigsaw: Meriam Report task cards**. Each student should receive only one task card (A, B, C, or D) based on the expert group to which they have been assigned.

- Tell students that they will work with their expert groups to closely read their assigned excerpts from the Meriam Report and then answer each of the questions on their task card. Students should be prepared to share their understanding of their excerpts and their responses to the questions with their home groups during Work Time B.

- Invite students to begin working. Encourage them to read their assigned excerpt silently first, and then appoint a group member to read the excerpt out loud again before students discuss its content and complete their section of the note-catcher. This gives all readers the chance to engage with the content in multiple modes. ▲ Provide **print or online dictionaries** as an option for students.

- As students work, circulate and provide support as needed. Allow more proficient groups to grapple; provide more intensive support to less proficient groups. ▲ Refer to **Jigsaw: Meriam Report task cards (example for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Work Time

C. Jigsaw Share: Meriam Report – SL.6.1d (15 minutes)

- Direct students to return to their home groups (ABCD). Tell students that they are now going to consolidate their learning from the Jigsaw and think about the point of view and key ideas evident in these excerpts as a whole.

- Distribute the **Analyze Point of View: Meriam Report note-catcher**. Explain that students will collaborate with their home groups to share out what they learned with their expert groups and then complete the first two white rows of this note-catcher together. (They will complete the remaining two rows individually during Closing and Assessment A).

- First, each student within the home group should share aloud the notes from their task cards, focusing on the gist statements they wrote for their assigned excerpts (question 5 on the task cards).

- As students listen to the other students in their home group share out their gist statements, they should take notes directly onto the first row Analyze Point of View: Meriam Report note-catcher to answer the question, *What are the key ideas in the excerpts?* Then, students will work together to complete the second row and address the question, *What point of view toward the boarding schools is being conveyed in the excerpts? What words from the excerpts helped you determine that point of view?* Students should stop after completing the second row. Refer to **Analyze Point of View: Meriam Report note-catcher (for teacher reference)**.

- Circulate the room to monitor progress. As productive, cue students to expand the conversation about point of view:

“Who can add on to what your classmate said?”

“Who can explain why your classmate came up with that response?”

- After several minutes, refocus whole group.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Closing and Assessment

A. Analyze and Compare Point of View: Meriam Report – RI.6.6 (5 minutes)

- Explain that students will now work independently and silently to complete the final two rows of the Analyze Point of View: Meriam Report note-catcher. Invite students to refer to the **Analyze Point of View: Captain Pratt note-catcher** from Lesson 3 and the **Analyze Point of View: “The Land of Red Apples” note-catcher** from Lesson 4 as needed to help them answer the questions. Refer to Analyze Point of View: Meriam Report note-catcher (for teacher reference), **Analyze Point of View: Captain Pratt note-catcher (for teacher reference)**, and **Analyze Point of View: “The Land of Red Apples” note-catcher (for teacher reference)**.

- After 4 minutes, reconvene whole group.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their habit of character focus for this lesson.

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
