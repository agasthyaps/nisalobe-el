<td><p>What point of view toward the boarding schools is being conveyed in the excerpts?</p>
<p>What words from the excerpts helped you determine that point of view?</p></td>
<td><strong>The author has a negative point of view toward the boarding schools and the way they are being run. He thinks the conditions of the schools are upsetting, unfair, and in need of fixing. He uses strong language to emphasize his point of view, like “grossly inadequate” and “outstanding deficiency.”</strong></td>

<tr class="odd">
<td>How does this point of view compare and contrast with the perspectives of Pratt and Zitkala-Sa?</td>
<td><p><strong>The point of view of the Meriam Report is the opposite of Captain Pratt’s point of view in his speech. Captain Pratt thought he was doing the Indians a favor by sparing them from their “savage” culture.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The point of view of the Meriam Report is in line with Zitkala-Sa’s point of view in her personal narrative. She describes her firsthand experience of the terrible conditions that Meriam highlights in his report.</strong></p></td>

<tr class="even">
<td>How do these excerpts add to our understanding of our topic?</td>
<td><strong>These excerpts give more information about the specific nature of American Indian boarding schools. They also describe the schools more generally, rather than mentioning one individual school, which gives us a broader idea of what these schools are like. The report also demonstrates that not every member of the U.S. government agreed that the schools were a good idea.</strong></td>
