(For Teacher Reference)

Students build their background knowledge about the Meriam Report while engaging in the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol. The purpose of this particular protocol is to share information and gain multiple perspectives through partner interaction.

Consider displaying the questions as they are asked to aid comprehension.

- Position partners back-to-back.

- Ask one question about figurative language and connotations from the list below. Repeat the question to aid listening comprehension.

- Allow time for students to think before giving the signal for students to turn front-to-front with their partner. Students can refer to their anchor text or the Background: Meriam Report handout during this time.

- Remind students to listen carefully as each partner shares.

- Give the signal for students to return to the back-to-back position.

- Repeat for each of the questions listed below.

1.  What do you know and what you can you infer about the author of the Meriam Report? Explain your thinking.

The author’s name is Lewis Meriam. I can infer that this man is probably some kind of accomplished social scientist or researcher because he completed an extensive and important study.

2.  What seems to be the purpose of the Meriam Report? Explain your thinking.

The purpose seems to be to find and distribute more information about the lives and livelihoods of American Indians in order to help them.

3.  Who do you think is the audience of the Meriam Report? Explain your thinking.

The audience of the Meriam Report is probably the U.S. government. The report contains suggestions for how to improve the living and working conditions of American Indians, and these changes would probably come through policies set by the government.

4.  What do you know about the impact of the Meriam Report? Explain your thinking.

The Meriam Report produced some positive changes, but not right away. Although the report was published in the 1920s, American Indian boarding schools remained until the 1970s.

5.  How do you think the Meriam Report relates to the overall topic of American Indian boarding schools? Explain your thinking.

The Meriam Report seems like it was a very comprehensive report that examined all kinds of elements of American Indian life, including education at American Indian boarding schools. This seems like it was an important report in that it showed people exactly what was happening at these schools.
