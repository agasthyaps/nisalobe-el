Final Word Protocol Anchor Chart

SL.6.1, SL.6.1a, SL.6.1b, SL.6.1c, SL.6.1d

**Purpose**

This protocol is designed to help students understand the meaning of a text or discuss an open-ended question, particularly to see how meaning can be constructed and supported by the ideas of others.

**Procedure**

1.  Each group selects a timekeeper and facilitator.

2.  Students then number off in the order that they will share their response to a given question.

3.  All students read the question from the note-catcher.

4.  The presenter has 1 minute to share his/her answer to the first question.

5.  Each group member comments on what was shared. Each group member has up to 30 seconds to comment on or add to the presenter’s thoughts.

6.  The presenter gets the final word, sharing how his/her thinking evolved after listening to others or re-emphasizing what was originally shared. The presenter may change his/her perspective, add to it, or stick with his/her original ideas.

7.  All students should add to their note-catchers with new thinking shared by their peers.

8.  Follow steps 4–7 with each additional student beginning the discussion on a different question from the note-catcher.
