Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- L.6.4b – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they break down a word (*assimilate*) into its affixes and use the affixes to generate a definition of the word.

- SL.6.1d – Work Time A: After listening to the Captain Pratt speech excerpt read aloud, students review its key ideas and share reflections about its purpose and audience.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time B: Students use textual evidence from a transcript of Captain Pratt’s speech to answer questions about the speech excerpt on their Analyze Point of View: Captain Pratt note-catchers.

- RI.6.2 – Work Time B: Students identify and describe key ideas in the Captain Pratt speech excerpt on their note-catchers.

- RI.6.6 – Work Time B: Students complete their Analyze Point of View: Captain Pratt note-catchers, answering questions about Pratt’s point of view, including how it is conveyed through specific words in the speech.

- SL.6.1c – Work Time B: Students participate in a Final Word protocol to pose and respond to questions during a discussion of Captain Pratt’s speech.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- This module has been designed to avoid assigning independent research reading for homework on the same evenings when students are prereading the next chapter in their anchor text. Proficient readers may be ready to begin their independent reading prior to this lesson. They could then be asked to prepare a Book Talk or other presentation of their reading for this lesson to promote excitement amongst their peers for the independent reading book selection.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- The Independent Research Reading assignment is critical for building background knowledge and domain-specific vocabulary on the module topic. Over the next three lessons, students read supplemental informational texts to begin understanding the context for the novel. As American Indian boarding schools are often neglected in narratives of American history, students will likely need to complete extensive outside reading to best understand the module topic.

Support All Students

- Students read an excerpt from Captain Richard H. Pratt’s infamous speech as a way to better understand the vitriolic attitudes fueling the development of American Indian boarding schools. The content of Pratt’s speech is important for students to understand, as it directly relates to the guiding question, *What were the objectives of early American Indian boarding schools?* Still, Pratt’s language is harsh and violent. It includes lines like “the only good Indian is a dead one” and describes the “savagery” of both American Indians and African-Americans. Another line describes the assimilation of “foreigners” to the United States. Allow students to voice their concern or express their outrage. In later lessons, encourage critical thinking by asking students to speculate as to why Pop, who loves Cal and who has himself attended an American Indian boarding school, might choose to send Cal to a school like this. A Turn and Talk protocol and discussion about the author’s purpose give students an additional opportunity to explore their feelings about the text.

- Although the supplemental text is short, it contains complex vocabulary that is likely to be challenging for all students, though especially so for ELLs. Support developing readers by annotating the supplemental text before distributing it (e.g., using glossed keywords, highlights of key sentences, a short summary in the margin). ▲

- Additionally, if time allows, consider asking students to read this passage more than once, with a different task each time (e.g., to understand the gist, to ask questions, to locate unknown vocabulary). Rereading the same passage for multiple purposes helps students become more confident and versatile readers. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson incorporates valuable vocabulary work. During Opening A, students use vocabulary strategies to deconstruct and better understand the meaning of the words *assimilate* and *acculturate*. This exercise provides useful strategy practice and also equips students with language to better understand and discuss both the informational text of Work Time A and the module topic overall. A Final Word protocol during Work Time B, as well as strategic combinations of Conversation Cues, deepen students’ thinking and provide helpful discussion parameters for students who need heavier support. Also during this lesson, students begin their independent research reading, which requires that they seek out and independently read texts related to the module’s topic, deepening content knowledge and strengthening reading skills.

- ELLs may find it challenging to interpret the excerpt from Captain Pratt’s speech, which was written in 1892 and contains complex and at times archaic vocabulary. To support students as they read, a glossary is available at the bottom of the text handout. Support students further by inviting them to use the differentiated version of the Analyze Point of View: Captain Pratt note-catcher during Work Time B. Additionally, ELLs may find it challenging to select appropriate texts for independent research reading. Make sure students understand the purpose of this task. Emphasize the benefits of reading multiple texts on the same topic (e.g., repeated exposure to relevant vocabulary; quicker decoding). Help ELLs who need heavier support while reading to locate simpler texts. Texts written slightly below a student’s reading level facilitate gains in reading speed and support reading fluency development—a critical skill for academic readers of all levels.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.2, 6.I.A.3, 6.I.B.6, and 6.I.B.7.

Assessment Guidance

- The speech by Captain Pratt analyzed in this lesson is a great example of the benefit of reading and rereading a text. Students, and perhaps even proficient readers, will need to read the text through several times before the central idea becomes clear. Push students not to attempt to understand every word, especially not in the first reading. Point out that Pratt often uses several sentences to capture a single idea. Read the text straight through once before chunking the text into these individual ideas.

- The Independent Research Reading assignment launched in this lesson continues throughout the rest of the module. Students read consistently each night for 20 minutes and answer a prompt of their choosing. From time to time, they will use class time to debrief what they are reading and how it connects to the module topic.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will read another supplemental informational text, a primary source from a student who attended Carlisle Indian Industrial School. Students continue to practice RI.6.6 by analyzing a different author’s point of view and how it is conveyed through her personal narrative.

- The independent reading assignment launched in this lesson is referred to throughout this and subsequent modules. Students have an opportunity to share their research reading in Unit 1 Lesson 14, Unit 2 Lesson 8, and Unit 3 Lesson 6.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Read the Captain Pratt speech excerpt in advance to identify points and vocabulary that may require clarification or sensitivity.

- Strategically group students into triads for Work Time B.

- Review the directions for the Final Word protocol.

- Prepare Independent research reading journals. These should be a continuation of the journals begun in Module 1, although students may wish to start a fresh copy for the new topic.

- Become familiar with several of the books provided on the research reading list to direct students towards books that match their interests and reading levels.

- Review the student tasks and example answers to get familiar with what students will be required to do in the lesson.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.6.4b (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 3**. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 3 (example for teacher reference)** for possible responses. Students will also need their anchor text, ***Two Roads***.

- Invite students to share their definitions of *assimilate*. Invite a student to clarify its precise meaning using an online or print dictionary. Add *assimilate* to the **academic word wall** and **vocabulary logs** (to make groups similar by incorporating one group into the dominant group).

- Point to the sentence where *assimilate* appears on page 316, and invite students to choral read it together.

- “Rather than continuing to fight expensive Indian Wars-–fought again and again because Native Americans stubbornly refused to give up their lands–schools could be used to assimilate and acculturate.”

- Point students to the word *acculturate*.

- Ask:

“What word do you recognize inside this word?” (culture)

- Point out that *acculturate* has a similar prefix and suffix as *assimilate*. Invite a student to look up its definition in an **online or print dictionary** (to make one culture more like another). Add *acculturate* to the academic word wall and vocabulary logs.

- Turn and Talk:

“Based on this excerpt, which group was expected to assimilate or acculturate?” (Native Americans)

“How were Native Americans expected to assimilate or acculturate?” (By going to schools to learn to be more like White European settlers.)

“What is the connotation of these words? How do you know?” (Negative because both words refer to actions that disrespect and dishonor a person’s culture and traditions.)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar to or the same as previous lessons. Invite students to choose a habit of character focus for themselves for this lesson.

Work Time

A. Read Captain Pratt Speech Excerpt – SL.6.1d (15 minutes)

- Remind students that the anchor text is historical fiction. Over the next several lessons, students will read supplemental informative texts to build background on this historical event to better understand the novel.

- Remind students that the Afterword referenced Richard Henry Pratt, who was quoted as saying, “Kill the Indian, save the man.”

- Turn and Talk:

“What does this statement mean?” (Pratt believed in destroying Indian culture and identity, but not by physically killing the Native Americans as had been common practice.)

- Distribute the **Analyze Point of View: Captain Pratt note-catcher**.

- Cold-call students to read the directions, column headings, and questions aloud. Clarify that students will listen to an excerpt from Captain Pratt’s infamous speech two times before reading the text. For the first reading, students should just listen. After the second reading, students will record their initial responses in the first column.

- Direct students’ attention to the **Point of View anchor chart**. Cold-call a student to read the parts of the chart related to informational texts.

- Point to the second question in the table on the Analyze Point of View Captain Pratt note-catcher. Explain that, for this question, students should explain Pratt’s perspective on the topic of Indian boarding schools.

- Invite students to close their eyes and listen closely.

- Read aloud the **Captain Pratt speech excerpt**.

- After the first reading, ask:

“What seems to be the purpose of this speech?” (The purpose is to explain why the American government should assimilate Indians through boarding schools.)

“Who is the likely audience? How do you know?” (The audience is likely other high-ranking members of the American government or military. I know this because the author is a captain, and he references “a great general,” which are military titles. He also uses the pronoun “we,” so his audience is likely people like himself. His language also doesn’t sound defensive; he is likely talking to other people who are open to his ideas.)

- Read aloud the Captain Pratt speech excerpt a second time.

- Direct students to complete the Listen column of the note-catcher. Refer to **Analyze Point of View: Captain Pratt note-catcher (example for teacher reference)**.

- Explain that they will complete the Read column in triads using a new protocol.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Work Time

B. Analyze Point of View – RI.6.6 (15 minutes)

- Move students into triads.

- Display **Final Word Protocol anchor chart**.

- Call on volunteers to read the steps of the protocol. Clarify any questions about the process. Model the protocol with a triad, if necessary.

- Direct students’ attention to the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**.

- Ask:

“Which of these habits of character best applies to the work we will be doing during the Final Word protocol?” (I collaborate.)

“What does effective collaboration look and sound like in the context of this activity?” (Following the protocol by taking turns. Actively listening to what each group member contributes and not focusing only on what I am going to say. Respectfully asking a group member for clarification if needed. Building on each other’s ideas.)

- Distribute the Captain Pratt speech excerpt to each student and allow time for students to read the speech. Direct them to use the Glossary provided to clarify difficult vocabulary.

- Remind triads to number themselves, then each take turns sharing their response to one of the questions in the table. Each student in the triad gets a chance to share what they wrote. The person who started the conversation gets the final word, sharing how their perspective or answer changed or evolved based on the contributions of the group.

- Repeat the protocol with each question in the table. Each student should get the final word on one of the questions.

- Circulate and monitor triad conversations. Provide answers to any clarifying questions without directly giving students answers to the note-catcher questions.

- Guide students using strategic combinations of Conversation Cues:

“Can you say more about that?” (Goal 1)

“Why do you think that?” (Goal 2)

“Who can add on to what your classmate said?” (Goal 4)

“How does our discussion add to your understanding of point of view?” (Goal 3)

- Remind students that it is okay to revise the information in the right column of their note-catcher based on new ideas stemming from the discussion.

- Call time on the protocol and refocus whole group.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their habit of character focus for this lesson.

For Lighter Support

- During the Final Word protocol of Work Time B, strategically use combinations of Conversation Cues to deepen the thinking of students who need lighter support. For example:

- “Can you give an example?” (Goal 1)

- “Why do you think that?” (Goal 3)

- “How is what \_\_\_ said the same as/different from what \_\_\_ said?” (Goal 4)

- “Who can explain why your classmate came up with that response?” (Goal 4)

For Heavier Support

- During the Final Word protocol of Work Time B, strategically use combinations of Conversation Cues to help students who need heavier support build upon the comments of others. For example:

- “Who can repeat what your classmate said?” (Goal 2)

- “So do you mean \_\_\_?” (Goal 1)

- “Can you say more about that?” (Goal 1)

- “Who can add on to what your classmate said?” (Goal 4)

Closing and Assessment

A. Launch Independent Research Reading – RL.6.10, RI.6.10 (10 minutes)

- Launch independent reading for this module. There is a suggested independent reading launch in the **Independent Reading Sample Plans**. Urge students to choose a text before the end of the lesson.

For Lighter Support

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a close read of a narrative text, “The Land of Red Apples.” Provide ELLs who need lighter support with one paragraph of the text ahead of time (e.g., paragraph 8: *It was night when we reached the school grounds. The lights from the windows of the large buildings fell upon some of the icicled trees that stood beneath them. We were led toward an open door, where the brightness of the lights within flooded out over the heads of the excited palefaces who blocked the way. My body trembled more from fear than from the snow I trod upon*). This paragraph acquaints students with some of the structural and lexical complexity of the text. Provide students with questions that guide their comprehension of the text and prepare them to dissect figurative language in the following lesson. These questions may include:

- What do you think “icicled trees” look like?

- How does the author play with the idea of light in this paragraph?

- How does the narrator’s use of language in this paragraph show how she is feeling?

For Heavier Support

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a close read of a narrative text, “The Land of Red Apples.” Provide ELLs who need heavier support with one paragraph of the text ahead of time (e.g., paragraph 14: *I had arrived in the wonderful land of rosy skies, but I was not happy, as I had thought I should be. My long travel and the bewildering sights had exhausted me. I fell asleep, heaving deep, tired sobs. My tears were left to dry themselves in streaks, because neither my aunt nor my mother was near to wipe them away*). This paragraph is the last in the essay, and it offers a clear picture of the author’s emotional state with less complex vocabulary or figurative language than other paragraphs. Provide students with sentence frames that prepare them to address ideas of point of view in the following lesson. These sentence frames may include:

- The narrator probably feels \_\_\_\_\_\_.

- The words and phrases that make me think this are \_\_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_\_, and \_\_\_\_\_\_.

- I think that the narrator feels \_\_\_\_\_\_ because she \_\_\_\_\_\_.

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
