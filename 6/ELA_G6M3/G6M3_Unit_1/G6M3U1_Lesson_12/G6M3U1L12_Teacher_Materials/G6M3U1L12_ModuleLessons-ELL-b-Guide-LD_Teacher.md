5-Minute Mini Language Dive

RL.6.4, SL.6.1, L.6.1

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

**She does it methodically**, grabbing a handful in her left hand, yanking it straight, then lopping it off with those razor-sharp steel shears. (from page 158 of *Two Roads* by Joseph Bruchac)

**Lesson 12 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after students read chapter 15 of *Two Roads* during Work Time A.

**Rationale**

- Module Guiding Questions and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the module guiding questions **(What kind of experiences did students have at American Indian boarding schools? How did these experiences impact students?)** by illustrating the pain of having one’s hair forcibly cut, which was a tragically common experience for students of American Indian boarding schools. This sentence also helps students address RL.6.4 and L.6.1 by featuring verbs with precise and vivid connotations and by including multiple pronouns (**she**; **it**), which refer to various antecedents. Supporting standards: SL.6.1.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses a series of evocative **-ing** verbs functioning as adverbs to describe the steps of a process and highlight the visceral nature of this experience (**grabbing**; **yanking**; **lopping**).

- Transfer: noun phrase + verb \[+ object\] + adverb = to specify the manner in which an action is undertaken when answering constructed response questions during the End of Unit 1 Assessment in Lesson 15. See Lesson 15 of this guide for specific suggestions for supporting students with this frame during the assessment.

Deconstruct

- **<u>She does it methodically</u>, grabbing a handful in her left hand, yanking it straight, then lopping it off with those razor-sharp steel shears.**

- Say:

“What does this sentence mean to you?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“This sentence contains several pronouns. What pronouns do you see?” (she; it; her)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **She does it methodically**

- Say:

“What do you notice about this chunk?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“Who does the pronoun She refer to in this sentence? What about the pronoun it?” (The pronoun She refers to the nurse, Mrs. Wilting. It refers to the process of chopping off Cal’s hair.)

- As needed, invite students to scan the sentences and paragraphs that precede the Mini Language Dive sentence to locate the answers to the two questions above. If productive, review the term **antecedent**.

- Draw students’ attention to the word **methodically**. If productive, invite students to practice saying this word aloud to their partners, noting its stress patterns and the way in which its pronunciation differs from the word **method**.

- Say:

“What part of speech is the word methodically? How do you know?” (adverb; it ends in –ly; it modifies the verb does.)

“What do adverbs do in a sentence?” (They tell us more about how the manner of the verb, or action, in a sentence.)

“What does it mean if an action is done methodically?” (It means it is done in careful or deliberate steps.)

Reconstruct

- **<u>She does it methodically</u>, grabbing a handful in her left hand, yanking it straight, then lopping it off with those razor-sharp steel shears.**

- Say:

“Which other words or phrases in this sentence are adverbs modifying the verb does, giving us more information about how she carried out this action?” (grabbing; yanking; lopping)

- Note: these **-ing** verbs are present participles (not gerunds) and they function as adverbs in the sentence. Students will explore the function of participles and other verbals in Grade 8 (L.8.1a); if useful, introduce this terminology now and alerting students to the Language standards that lie ahead.

“Can you figure out why the author chose words like grabbing, yanking, and lopping instead of words with similar meanings like holding, pulling, and cutting?” (Answers will vary, but look for students to understand that these words are more precise and more physical. They describe the experience in a more visceral way than other words might have.)

“How do the connotations of these words help us understand the impact of this experience on Cal?” (The physical, aggressive connotations of these words highlight what a personal and violent experience this is for Cal.)

- Say:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive help you address the guiding question: What kind of experiences did students have at American Indian boarding schools? How did these experiences impact students?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display the following sentence frame:

**I study \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

adverb -ing verb phrase -ing verb phrase

(noun phrase + verb \[+ object\] + adverb, present participle phrase + present participle phrase)

- Say:

“Use this frame to describe the way in which you study. Use an adverb and then -ing phrases functioning as adverbs to describe specific examples. Use your own words, and work with your partners.”

- Remind students that, as in the original sentence, the **-ing** verb they select is likely to require more words than the verb to make sense in the sentence. It may need to be a full phrase (e.g., “yanking it straight” versus simply “yanking”).

- Possible student answers:

**I study <u>carefully</u>, <u>reading slowly</u> and <u>taking detailed notes</u>.**
