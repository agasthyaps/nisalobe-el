An intensive pronoun

- can be removed from the sentence and the sentence would still be complete.

- can refer to the subject of the sentence but it cannot be the subject.

- often, though not always, appears right after the noun or pronoun it is emphasizing.

1.  Read each pair of sentences. Discuss how the intensive pronoun changes the sentence.

| Sentence Pair | Sentence 1                                | Sentence 2                                        |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| A             | I finished the project.                   | I finished the project myself.                    |
| B             | The dog opened the bag of dog food.       | The dog itself opened the bag of dog food.        |
| C             | We went to the trial to hear Adria speak. | We went to the trial to hear Adria herself speak. |

Sentence A:

- *Myself* adds emphasis to the fact that the project was completed by one individual, the subject.

- Answers will vary, but may include: If it was important to show that the project was finished without help. Perhaps the other partners did not do their work and the subject of the sentence wanted to make it known that he/she did all the work alone.

Sentence B:

- *Itself* adds emphasis to the fact that the bag was opened by the dog without help.

- Answers will vary, but may include: To show surprise that the dog was capable of opening the bag. To point to the dog as the culprit for the bag being opened.

Sentence C:

- *Herself* adds emphasis to the fact that hearing something in person spoken from a particular source was important to the subject.

- Answers will vary, but may include: The subjects wanted to hear information straight from the source. As someone is on trial in this sentence, perhaps the audience wants to see whether she would be truthful.

2.  With a partner, write a sentence using an intensive pronoun.

Sample student response: He told me himself that he was going to be at the party.

3.  Fill in each sentence with an appropriate intensive pronoun.

    1.  Did you cook this amazing meal **<u>yourself</u>**?

    2.  I **<u>myself</u>** can think of no other place I would rather be.

    3.  Leave it alone. I’ll do it **<u>myself</u>**.

    4.  We **<u>ourselves</u>** are responsible for our own actions.

    5.  I can’t believe she did that **<u>herself</u>**!

    6.  Sophia and Oliver can take care of it **<u>themselves</u>**.
