<tr class="odd">
<td>4–5</td>
<td><strong>Pop says that he will go to Washington, DC, without Cal. Cal will go to school instead.</strong></td>
<td><strong>“confused,” “befuddled,” “baffled”; asks himself several questions to try to understand what Pop is talking about</strong></td>
<td><strong>Cal is nervous about being separated from his father because they are supposed to take care of each other.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>9</td>
<td><strong>Cal learns that he is half Creek Indian.</strong></td>
<td><strong>He is confused and feels like his world is upside down, but he decides he will have to get used to it.</strong></td>
<td><strong>Cal is adaptable. He trusts his father. Even though he is confused, he is willing to accept his new reality.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>12</td>
<td><p><strong>Cal’s challenge is the disturbing vision he has of being in a crowd and needing to find Pop.</strong></p>
<p><strong>He is also struggling with not wanting to upset Pop with his uncertainty about going to Challagi.</strong></p></td>
<td><p><strong>The visions are common, but he doesn’t say much about them to anyone, even when they are frightening.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cal also chooses not to be totally honest with Pop about his feelings. Cal spares Pop’s feelings and takes care of Pop by standing up straight and moving forward.</strong></p></td>
<td><p><strong>The visions show how deeply connected Cal feels toward other people. His visions may indicate a heightened connection or sensitivity to others.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cal’s interaction with Pop shows that Cal is selfless. He puts Pop’s comfort above his own. He believes in sticking to the promise that Cal and Pop take care of each other.</strong></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>13–14</td>
<td><strong>Cal is given a tour by Superintendent Morrell, then Possum. A lot of information is being given to Cal very quickly. Cal is not looking forward to his father leaving him at Challagi.</strong></td>
<td><strong>Cal is very quiet. He provides very brief answers when asked a question. Cal internally wishes that he were somewhere else, but he outwardly shows calmness.</strong></td>
<td><strong>Cal does not allow his emotions to consume him. Cal is able to remain calm in stressful situations.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>15</td>
<td><strong>Cal’s hair is cut and he is treated roughly by the school nurse.</strong></td>
<td><strong>Cal does not resist having his hair cut and receiving the vaccines. He answers the nurse’s questions but does not allow her to see that her questions, especially about his mother, are upsetting to him.</strong></td>
<td><strong>This shows that Cal continues to be respectful, quiet, and compliant on the outside, even though we know from his inner thoughts that he feels very differently from how he acts. Again, Cal doesn’t share his feelings, not wanting to make any trouble.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>18</td>
<td><strong>Cal has been challenged to a fight by Bear Meat, who is bigger and stronger than Cal. The head disciplinarian breaks up the fight.</strong></td>
<td><strong>Cal does not tattle on Bear Meat to the head disciplinarian.</strong></td>
<td><strong>This shows that Cal is feeling more aligned with the Challagi students. He is showing allegiance to the students and suspicion toward the adults. Bear Meat welcomes Cal into their “gang,” as a result.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>25–26</td>
<td><p><strong>Pop writes a letter to Cal asking him to hang in there and offering no date when they will be reunited.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cal has another vision—this one seems to indicate that something bad is going to happen to Pop.</strong></p></td>
<td><p><strong>At first, Cal hides his true feelings and tries to be a good son and student. He is upset by Pop’s letter but tries to make the best of things.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Then, Cal’s vision scares him and makes him think Pop is not safe. He and his friends prepare to do something about it.</strong></p></td>
<td><strong>Cal is putting his concern for others above his concern for himself.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>29</td>
<td><strong>Gale reveals the danger of the Bonus Army encampment; she refers to it as “a war zone” (298).</strong></td>
<td><strong>Cal is grateful and kind to Gale; he respects her and appreciates all she does for him, including the food, first aid, clothing, and information.</strong></td>
<td><strong>This interaction shows that Cal does live by his own code and treats everyone as he would like to be treated.</strong></td>
