- plight (65): an unhappy or unlucky situation

**Questions**

- page 62, “If you want to hear something, don’t talk.”

> **What does Cal mean by “If you want to hear something, don’t talk”? Being quiet leaves space for someone else to explain themselves or elaborate on what they were saying. Being quiet lets someone know you are actively listening and interested in hearing more about what they have to say.**

- page 63, “. . . thoughts of them were friendly-like.”

> **How has your own learning in school about Native Americans compared to Cal’s? Responses will vary, but may include references to learning about Pilgrims and Indians at Thanksgiving time, or conflicts with Native Americans as pioneers pressed westward, spurred by a belief in Manifest Destiny.

- page 65, “‘. . . school called Carlisle.’”

> **What does Pop explain to be the purpose of Indian schools? How does it differ from Cal’s first prediction about Indian school at the beginning of the chapter?  
> Indian schools were started to teach Indians to act like the white European settlers who established the United States, as this was cheaper than trying to kill them all. This is in contrast to Cal’s initial prediction at the beginning of the chapter, when he thought Indian schools were meant to teach people how to be Indian.**

- page 67, “. . . have an episode.”

> **Explain what happened to Lucius. Lucius was likely suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. His experiences in the military during World War I were so horrific, he was having hallucinations, or “episodes," where he believed he was still there.**

Cal describes their behavior as “polite” and that they try to go “unnoticed.”**

- page 105, “. . . said we’re headed.”

> **How is Cal feeling? Why? How do you know? Cal is feeling nervous because Pop has recently explained that Cal will be going to a new school, Challagi. The author writes that Cal is finding it hard to speak, his heart is pounding, and he is breathing slowly to calm himself.**

- page 111, “. . . like a sore thumb.”

> **Name three reasons why Cal is nervous to go to Challagi.  
> Cal only has one parent left and no house; he will miss being with his father, the only family or home he has left. He also enjoys being a hobo and is good at it. Cal has only just learned that he is half Indian; this identity is new to him. He is nervous about not looking or sounding as Indian as the other students.**

- page 118, “. . . to happen next”

> **How are the horses similar to Cal? The horses are upset because they are being separated from the soldiers they knew. They are unsure about what is going to happen to them next. This is similar to Cal, who is upset about being separated from his father and nervous about what is going to happen when he gets to Challagi.**

- page 122, “. . . maybe go to an ice cream parlor”

> **What does Cal mean when he tells himself, “A man can stand almost anything as long as it’s not forever”? Cal is trying to prepare himself for a short stay at Challagi. He believes that he is tough enough to manage being away from Pop, having his hair cut, and anything else that happens at school because it’s only temporary.**

- page 124, “. . . must have slept”

> **Why does Cal think he hears the rails saying, “You’re White. You’re Indian”?  
> The sound of the rails represents what is going through Cal’s mind. He is struggling with his two identities, white and Indian. He is so focused on this problem, he feels like he can hear it everywhere.**

- page 127, “‘. . .wealth or power’”

> **What does this dialogue tell the reader about Pop’s character? He believes in fairness, not competition or always trying to prove yourself. Pop believes that generosity and equality are more important than trying to better others by acquiring more wealth or power.**

> Pop seems to be feeling nostalgic about being back, as memories are coming back to him. He recognizes the marching drills and can point out small mistakes the boys make. He is enjoying the music. He recognizes and compliments the superintendent. Pop seems comfortable being back in a familiar place.**

- page 139, “. . .cough loudly in his hand”

> **Why does Pop have this reaction? Pop does not agree with Superintendent Morrell’s description of Indians as “savage” and Challagi as a place where they are molded to be better prepared for the world than they would be with their Indian families.**

- page 144, “‘. . . full benefits of civilization’”

> **What does this statement tell the reader about Superintendent Morrell?  
> Morrell looks down on the Indians. He is condescending. In his mind, however, he believes he is truly trying to help the American Indians.**

- page 154, “. . . fondness for birds”

> **How does Cal get his nickname, Jay Bird? What does it mean? He gets his nickname from Possum. It comes from the figure of speech “to squawk like a jay bird.” This is ironic because Cal is very quiet. Possum thinks it’s funny to give him a nickname that is so in contrast with Cal’s true personality.**

- page 155, “. . . already found a friend”

> **How does Cal know that Possum will be a friend? Possum has been very kind to him so far. He tells Cal the truth about the school and tries to make him feel comfortable. He talks to Morrell in a mocking, but funny, sort of way. He holds Cal’s pack for him while Cal goes into the infirmary. In a very short amount of time, he has demonstrated the qualities of a good friend.**

- kerosene (159): a liquid fuel

- page 162, “‘Deceased it is’”

> **What does this interaction between Cal and the nurse tell the reader about Mrs. Wilting? Mrs. Wilting is not particularly sympathetic or caring. She is rough in her physical and verbal interactions with Cal. She shows no sympathy when he answers that his mother has died. She is only interested filling in the paperwork so she can be done with the task. Mrs. Wilting also determines Cal’s ethnicity simply by looking at him. This shows that she’s not sensitive to or interested in the special nature of a person’s identity.**

The reader can infer that he sold the jewelry for the money to buy the car.**

- page 173, “‘. . . even before he shoots it’”

> **Why does Possum keep mentioning Grampa Big Rabbit? Possum has learned a lot from his grandfather: how to spot a friend, how to store a bow, and what can be inferred about a man by the way he handles a gun. Possum clearly respects Grampa Big Rabbit and cherishes his advice.**

- page 176, “. . . and he doesn’t ask”

> **Why are both Cal and Possum quiet all of a sudden? They are lost in their thoughts about a terrible time in history when the Cherokee were forced off their land by the United States government on a long and deadly march. (Note: The full name of this event is not included in the chapter. Explain to students that this was called the Trail of Tears.) Cal experiences a vision of this horrific event, and Possum seems to understand what Cal has experienced but says nothing about it and only offers the box for Cal’s France Victory Medal.**

The show of acceptance from Skinny may help Cal become more comfortable with other students.**

- page 200, “‘Nobody pushed me. I fell.’”

> **Why does Cal not tell the head disciplinarian what really happened with Bear Meat?  
> Cal understands that new students are often tested by other students. If Cal reports what really happened, then the boys in the Creek gang may feel as though they cannot trust Cal.

- page 209, “. . . Little Coon dropped to the ground beside me.”

- page 233, “. . . that leads us closest to the near meadow.”

> **Why might Possum and Cal want to take a scenic route to the harness shop?  
> Possum and Cal spend all day following rules, marching, and working. Taking a route that gives them a sense of freedom by being closer to nature may be calming for them.**

- page 235, “‘I’ll walk you to his office. Help you find out.’”

> **What new information has Cal learned from Possum? Why is the information important? Possum tells Cal that students get paid for their work, so Cal may have money in the bursar’s office.

- page 239, “. . . he really wants to teach us the right way to do things.”

> **How do the Indian instructors seem different from the white teachers?

- page 245, “. . . boys on the boxing team.”

> **What is the benefit of being one of the athletic boys at Challagi? Why might that benefit appeal to Cal? The athletic boys sit at a special table during mess. They are provided more food.

- page 249, “‘You got sand, son.’”

> **What does Cal’s boxing match with Bear Meat tell the reader about Cal?

> **Why might Cal’s participation in the stomp dance be surprising to a reader?  
> Cal arrived at Challagi and did not want to be there at all. He was confused about his identity and knew nothing of being Indian. He was concerned about how he would fit in with students who already knew about their Indian heritage. Cal participating in the stomp dance shows that Cal has let go of some of his worries, and he is open to experiences that connect him to his heritage.**

- page 258, “Now I am not just worrying about him but about me.”

> **What do Cal’s moments of worries tell the reader? Even though Cal may be enjoying himself, learning about being Creek, and building strong friendships, Cal does not forget about his father. Cal’s concern for his father is something that remains with him.**

- page 259, “. . . stronger than all the Challagi rules.”

> **How is Tommy Wilson different from Cal? Tommy is a boy who looks white, but is secure in his identity as Muskogee Creek. Tommy has not been accepted by the Creek gang at Challagi. Cal looks Indian, but is struggling with his identity. Cal has been accepted by the Creek gang.**
