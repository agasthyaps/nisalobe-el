An intensive pronoun

- can be removed from the sentence and the sentence would still be complete.

- can refer to the subject of the sentence but it cannot be the subject.

- often, though not always, appears right after the noun or pronoun it is emphasizing.

1.  Read each pair of sentences. Discuss how the intensive pronoun changes the sentence.

| Sentence Pair | Sentence 1                                | Sentence 2                                        |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| A             | I finished the project.                   | I finished the project myself.                    |
| B             | The dog opened the bag of dog food.       | The dog itself opened the bag of dog food.        |
| C             | We went to the trial to hear Adria speak. | We went to the trial to hear Adria herself speak. |

2.  With a partner, write a sentence using an intensive pronoun.

3.  Fill in each sentence with an appropriate intensive pronoun.
