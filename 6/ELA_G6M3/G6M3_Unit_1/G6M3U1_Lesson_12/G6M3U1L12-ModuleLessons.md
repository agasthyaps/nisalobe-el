Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RL.6.3 – Opening A: Students add to their Analyze Character: *Two Roads* note-catchers with information about how Cal responds to challenges in chapters 13 and 14 of the text.

- RL.6.1 – Work Time A: After reading chapter 15 of *Two Roads*, students answer questions about the text, using textual evidence to support their analysis of text structure and character development.

- RL.6.3 – Work Time A: Students answer questions about how Cal responds to challenges in the text and develops as a character.

- RL.6.5 – Work Time A: Students answer questions about how chapter 15 fits within the larger structure of the novel and helps to develop the setting of the text.

- L.6.1b – Work Time B: Students participate in a Mini Lesson in which they receive direct instruction on the form, meaning, and use of intensive pronouns, analyze examples, and practice inserting intensive pronouns into sentence frames on the Practice Intensive Pronouns handout.

- L.6.1b – Closing and Assessment A: Students complete the Practice Intensive Pronouns handout.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- An optional Mini Language Dive, intended for use after students read chapter 15 of *Two Roads* during Work Time A, is available in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Expand on the work with intensive pronouns by showing examples of intensive pronouns used in literature or in popular songs. Encourage students to bring in real-world examples of intensive pronouns being used in a variety of media (e.g., articles, songs, tweets, jokes).

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students read chapters 13 and 14 in the anchor text, *Two Roads*. By analyzing the characters’ speech varieties, students learned that purpose and audience affect a character’s speech and provide insight for the reader. In this lesson, students continue reading *Two Roads* and are introduced to intensive pronouns which will be assessed in the End of Unit 1 and the End of Unit 2 Assessments.

Support All Students

- In Chapter 15, Cal’s long hair is cut short against his will. After reading the passage “The Cutting of My Long Hair” by Zitkala-Sa during the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment, students may feel especially distressed by the description of Cal’s hair being cut. Allow space for students to share their reflections; remind students to show compassion and empathy towards students who are affected by this chapter.

- During the same scene, Cal is questioned about his identity and declared “full-blood” based on how he looks (162). He is also asked about his parents and required to disclose that his mother has passed away. The curt questions and cold behavior from the infirmary nurse may make some students feel upset on Cal’s behalf. Encourage them to think about how the author uses these details to establish Cal’s point of view and present his understanding of his surroundings.

- To support ELLs, this lesson features direct grammar instruction with scaffolding. Appropriate pronoun use is a key language goal for Grade 6 (L.6.1); this lesson helps students work toward that goal by facilitating practice with intensive pronouns.

- ELLs may find it challenging to differentiate between intensive and reflexive pronouns. This confusion could lead to omission of reflexive pronouns—which would render a grammatical sentence ungrammatical—or to overuse of intensive pronouns—which could alter one’s writing or speech in stylistically inappropriate ways. Clarify that intensive pronouns do not adjust the core grammar of a sentence. Rather, they lead to a change in emphasis or stress that, when used correctly, may improve the clarity of a sentence. Remind students that they will have several opportunities to practice this distinction in the lessons preceding the end of unit assessment.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.B.6, 6.II.A.1, 6.II.B.4, and 6.II.B.5.

Assessment Guidance

- To gather more evidence of students’ progress towards mastery of RL.6.6, request that students provide an example from both chapters 13 and 14 on their Analyze Point of View: *Two Roads* note-catcher in Opening A.

- Ensure that students are not confusing intensive pronouns with reflexive pronouns, which are written the same way, but have a distinct grammatical function in a sentence. Consider giving examples of reflexive pronouns to better explain intensive pronouns. Remind students that the key to determining an intensive pronoun is the ability to remove it from a sentence without changing the meaning.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will read the next chapter in *Two Roads* and participate in a Language Dive to build upon their understanding of language varieties and character development.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Preread chapter 15 of *Two Roads* to identify potentially challenging vocabulary or plot points.

- Review definition and use of intensive pronouns. Be clear on the difference between intensive and reflective pronouns. Students are also likely to question why it is important to understand the nuances of grammar. Be prepared to explain that the more students understand about the mechanics of language, the better they can understand what makes a sentence or a paragraph clear and interesting, and, thus, can replicate that precision and beauty in their own writing.

- Determine strategic partnerships for work on intensive pronouns during Work Time B.

- Review the new materials used in this lesson to ensure clarity about what students will need to know and be able to do.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time B: Find a brief and engaging video online about intensive pronouns to reinforce learning.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RL.6.3 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Direct students to fill in the next row of their **Analyze Character: *Two Roads*** **note-catcher** using evidence from chapters 13 or 14 of their anchor text, ***Two Roads***. Refer to the **Analyze Character: *Two Roads*** **note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Using a preferred classroom routine, collect or review the answers to **Homework: Analyze Structure and Point of View: *Two Roads***, **Chapter 13**. Refer to **Homework: Analyze Structure and Point of View: *Two Roads***, **Chapter 13 (answers for teacher reference)**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar to or the same as previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read *Two Roads*, Chapter 15 – RL.6.3, RL.6.5 (20 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Read chapter 15 of the text, using **Text Guide: *Two Roads*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students who are ready to read independently or in small groups should be released to this independence. Students continue to record the gist on the **gist** **anchor chart** using **sticky notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Students continue to identify how characters in the text demonstrate habits of character. Refer to the **Gist anchor chart: *Two Roads*** **(example for teacher reference)** and **chapter synopsis** as needed, as well as any other appropriate resources.

- Gist: The school nurse roughly cuts Cal’s hair, injects him with vaccines, and gives him a physical exam.

- Ask:

“Think about the way that Bruchac characterizes the nurse through her actions and dialogue. What does his characterization suggest?” (Answers will vary, but may include: Her actions are rough and unfeeling; her words are abrupt, brisk, and issued as commands. She doesn’t seem to connect with Cal in any way. She often says that she’s doing things that are not her job, but she doesn’t seem to care about quality. She is not characterized as a feeling person, just doing her job with the automaticity of a robot or machine.)

“How does this chapter function within the structure of the novel? How does this chapter help to develop the setting of *Two Roads*?” (Answers will vary, but may include: This chapter gives the reader some insight into the environment that Cal is entering by showing us one of the other adults in charge. It suggests the detached formality of the superintendent carries across the whole setting as far as the school staff are concerned.)

“What connections do you notice between this chapter and Zitkala-Sa’s experiences we read about during previous lessons?” (Answers will vary, but may include: Cal also gets his hair cut in a rough fashion, the nurse seems to be as unhearing and unseeing as the adults at Zitkala-Sa’s school, and just as lacking in expertise and care. It also echoes a version of the “iron routine,” of the mechanical and detached way of interacting, just following procedure.)

“How does the way Cal responds to this challenging experience with the nurse help to develop our understanding of his character?” (Answers will vary, but may include: It shows that he continues to be respectful, quiet, and compliant on the outside, even though we know from his inner thoughts that he feels very differently from how he acts. Again, Cal doesn’t share his feelings, not wanting to make any trouble.)

- Refocus whole group. Direct students to retrieve their Analyze Character: *Two Roads* note-catcher. Instruct students to fill in the row for chapter 15 using the example discussed. Refer to Analyze Character: *Two Roads* note-catcher (example for teacher reference) as needed.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time A, after students read chapter 15 of *Two Roads*, invite students to participate in a Mini Language Dive in small groups to track the antecedents of multiple pronouns (L.6.1). This Mini Language Dive also highlights the importance of word choice and connotation, as it uses three evocative *-ing* verbs (*grabbing*, *yanking*, *lopping*) to describe the visceral and violent nature of a key event in the text (RL.6.4).

- Develop an extension activity using the sentence from the Mini Language Dive during Work Time A: “She does it methodically, grabbing a handful in her left hand, yanking it straight, then lopping it off with those razor-sharp steel shears.” Invite students who need lighter support to compare this sentence with the following sentence from “The Cutting of My Long Hair,” which students read as part of the mid-unit assessment of Lesson 7: “I cried aloud, shaking my head all the while until I felt the cold blades of the scissors against my neck, and heard them gnaw off one of my thick braids.” Students can use the following questions to guide their comparison of the two sentences:

- In what ways are these sentences similar? In what ways are they different?

- How is the narrator’s point of view similar or different in these two sentences?

For Heavier Support

- Develop an extension activity using the sentence from the Mini Language Dive during Work Time A: “She does it methodically, grabbing a handful in her left hand, yanking it straight, then lopping it off with those razor-sharp steel shears.” Invite students who need heavier support to rewrite this sentence as multiple sentences, rewriting the *-ing* verbs in the simple present or past tense (e.g., She does it methodically. She grabs a handful in her left hand. She yanks it straight. She lops it off with those razor-sharp steel shears). Encourage students to speculate on ways that the meaning or impact changes when these ideas are separated into multiple sentences. This activity will reinforce key learning surrounding an important Language standard (L.6.3a), as well as provide beneficial practice with verb tenses.

Work Time

B. Mini Lesson: Intensive Pronouns – L.6.1b (15 minutes)

- Using **equity sticks**, call on a student and ask:

“What is a pronoun? How would you explain or define pronouns?” (Pronouns take the place of a noun.)

- Using equity sticks, call on a student and ask:

“What is the purpose of using pronouns?” (They make writing smoother and more succinct because the noun does not have to be repeated over and over. They keep the writing from sounding too repetitive.)

- Using equity sticks, call on a few students and ask:

“Can you give us an example of a pronoun?” (I, you, he, she, it, we, them, her, etc.)

- Explain that there are many sub-categories of pronouns. Students are likely familiar with personal pronouns (he, she, we, it, etc.) or object pronouns (me, you, him, her, us, etc.). Students may even be familiar with possessive pronouns (mine, yours, his, hers, etc.)

- Explain that today students will learn about another type of pronoun: intensive pronouns.

- Distribute and display the **Practice Intensive Pronouns** handout. Reference **Practice Intensive Pronouns (example for teacher reference)** as needed. Focus students on the top of the handout, the intensive pronouns chart. Ask:

“What do you notice about these pronouns?” (They all end in “-self”.)

- Turn and talk:

“Look at the word *intensive*. What does it mean when something is *intense*?” (extreme, strong, forceful, powerful)

- Explain that *intense* and *intensive* are both adjectives with similar meaning. Explain that intensive pronouns add emphasis in a sentence. An intensive pronoun refers back to the noun in the sentence to add emphasis.

- Focus students on item 1 of the Practice Intensive Pronouns handout. Point to pair A of the example sentences, and read each aloud.

- “I finished the project.”

- “I finished the project myself.”

- Turn and Talk:

“How does the intensive pronoun change the sentence?” (It adds emphasis to the fact that the project was completed by one individual, the subject.)

“In what scenario might you write this sentence with this intensive pronoun?” (Answers will vary, but may include: If it was important to show that the project was finished without help, perhaps the other partners did not do their work and the subject of the sentence wanted to make it known that he/she did all the work alone.)

- Point out that the intensive pronoun could be removed from the sentence, and the sentence would still be complete.

- Focus students on pair B of the example sentences, and read each aloud.

- “The dog opened the bag of dog food.”

- “The dog itself opened the bag of dog food.”

- Turn and Talk:

“How does the intensive pronoun change the sentence?” (It adds emphasis to the fact that the bag was opened by the dog without help.)

“In what scenario might you write this sentence with this intensive pronoun?” (Answers will vary, but may include: To show surprise that the dog was capable of opening the bag. To point to the dog as the culprit for the bag being opened.)

- Point out that intensive pronouns can refer to the subject of the sentence but they cannot be the subject.

- Focus students on pair C of the example sentences, and read each aloud.

- “We went to the trial to hear Adria speak.”

- “We went to the trial to hear Adria herself speak.”

- Turn and Talk:

“How does the intensive pronoun change the sentence?” (It adds emphasis to the fact that hearing something in person spoken from a particular source was important to the subject.)

“In what scenario might you write this sentence with this intensive pronoun?” (Answers will vary, but may include: The subjects wanted to hear information straight from the source. As someone is on trial in this sentence, perhaps the audience wants to see whether she would be truthful.)

- Point out that intensive pronouns often, though not always, appear right after the noun or pronoun they are emphasizing.

- Direct students to item 2 of the Practice Intensive Pronouns handout. With a partner, invite students to write an original sentence using an intensive pronoun.

Closing and Assessment

A. Practice Intensive Pronouns – L.6.1b (5 minutes)

- Direct students to item 3 of the Practice Intensive Pronouns handout. Students should complete this item independently. Circulate and scan students’ answers to determine where students will need extra support.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their habit of character focus for this lesson.

Homework

A. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread chapter 16 in *Two Roads* in preparation for studying this chapter in the next lesson.

For Lighter Support

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from chapter 16, page 167 of *Two Roads*: “Library here ain’t worth an owl’s hoot.” If students are unfamiliar with the language variety Possum uses in this excerpt, they may find this sentence especially surprising or interesting. Provide ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Invite students who need lighter support to generate some questions that can be used during the Language Dive of the following lesson. This will support students’ feelings of ownership over their own learning.

For Heavier Support

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence that Possum utters during chapter 16, page 167 of *Two Roads*: “Library here ain’t worth an owl’s hoot.” If students are unfamiliar with the language variety Possum uses in this excerpt, they may find this sentence especially surprising. Provide ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Encourage students who need heavier support to independently record notices and wonderings before the next lesson. This will help students gather their thoughts and prepare them to ask and answer meaningful questions during the Language Dive.
