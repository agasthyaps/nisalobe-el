**Sentence**

Library here ain’t **worth an owl’s hoot.** (*Two Roads*, page 167)

Launch

Prior to the Language Dive, consider inviting students to review the meaning of **variations** and **standard English** per L.6.1e. It may be most effective to present students with multiple definitions of **standard English** retrieved from distinct sources (e.g., from the dictionary vs. from an academic article written by a linguist). Students are likely to find that no clear definition of **standard English** exists, despite this being a common term that many use freely.

Library here

Deconstruct

- **Library**

“Can you figure out why the speaker, Possum, did not include the definite article the before library?” (Responses will vary, but may include: because he is speaking to a friend, Cal, using a language variety that is familiar to both of them; because the word here specifies which library he is talking about and Cal understands what Possum means without the article; because the author wants to convey more about Possum’s character. \[noun phrase\])

ain’t

Deconstruct

- Students can use an online learner’s dictionary to examine the many different meanings of **ain’t** (am not, is not, are not, have not, has not) and note its versatility (i.e., can be used to replace multiple verbs; can be singular or plural).

“Can you figure out why the author wrote ain’t?” (To signal the use of a variety of English that is most appropriately used in some language communities or in certain situations with friends. \[verb phrase; contraction\])

“Does the speaker, Possum, always use the word ain’t instead of words like isn’t, aren’t, or hasn’t? Read the rest of page 167 for examples to support your answer.” (Possum does not always choose to use the word ain’t; later on page 167, Possum uses the word aren’t instead of ain’t: “. . . I love reading adventure stories—there aren’t many in our library.”)

“What do this chunk and the previous chunk tell us about the speaker, Possum?”  
(That he is speaking to a friend; that he uses different varieties at different times for different purposes.)

“In what classroom contexts might ain’t be considered appropriate? In other classroom contexts, what alternatives could we use?” (If the word ain’t is commonly spoken within one of your language communities, it may be appropriate to use this word during casual in-class conversations with friends or with others from your language community. In other classroom contexts where we expect academic English, we could use alternatives like isn’t, aren’t, hasn’t, or haven’t.)

worth an owl’s hoot.

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Ask:

“What do you want to discuss about this chunk? Refer to the Questions We Can Ask during a Language Dive anchor chart and Conversation Cues anchor chart for support.”

- **worth**

“What do we mean when we talk about what something is worth?” (We are talking about its value. \[preposition\])

- **an owl’s hoot**

“What does an owl’s hoot sound like? Sketch a picture of an owl’s hoot on your note-catchers.” 🖉 Step 3 (noun phrase; idiom)

“Can you figure out what it means for a library to not be ‘worth an owl’s hoot’?”  
(It means the library is worthless; it is not a good or helpful library.)

“Have you ever heard this phrase before?” (Probably not!)

“What does the rareness of this chunk tell us about the speaker, Possum?” (That he has a particular way of speaking that is unique to him; that he likes to speak with figurative language; that he is probably talking to a friend in a familiar setting.)

- Students can examine other more common idioms and phrases that use the word worth, such as:

- A picture is worth <u>a thousand words</u>.

- It is worth <u>its weight in gold</u>.

- A bird in the hand is worth <u>two in the bush</u>.

- It’s not worth <u>it</u>.

“What do the underlined phrases have in common with the phrase an owl’s hoot? What does this tell us about the structure of this chunk?” (They are all noun phrases; the preposition worth should probably be followed by a noun phrase.)

- **Students can use Conversation Cues as they discuss. To provide heavier support, display a suggested sequence, such as the one below:**

- Goal 1. Let’s take time to think and write or sketch.

- Goal 1: Can you say more about that?

- Goal 3: Why do you think so?

- Goal 4: Do you agree or disagree with what your classmate said? Why?

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Students can use noun phrases to complete the following sentence frames.  Step 4

“A new bike is worth \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.” (A new bike is worth about \$100).

“To me, friendship is worth \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.” (To me, friendship is worth all the money in the world).

- To provide lighter support: “Which of these frames is better suited for a figurative answer? Which is better suited for a literal answer?”

- To provide heavier support: Invite students to choose just one of the sentence frames to complete.

Library here ain’t worth an owl’s hoot.

Reconstruct

- Ask:

“What else could Possum have said to convey similar feelings about the library? Think of as many options as possible.” (Responses will vary, but look for differences in language variety \[e.g., “The library here is not good”\].)

“How might Possum’s speech change as his audience changes?” (Responses will vary, but may include: Possum’s speech may shift from a ‘friend variety’ to ‘student’ or ‘classmate’ variety that might call for alternatives like isn’t instead of ain’t.)

“Why do you think the author chose to represent Possum’s speech in this way instead of using an alternative?” (Because the author wanted to give us more information about Possum’s identity and character through his use of language.)

“What does Possum’s use of language help to convey about his character in this chapter?” (Responses will vary, but may include: Possum feels comfortable talking to Cal; Possum is creative in his language use; Possum likes to use certain grammatical structures and figurative language to emphasize his ideas or affirm relationships.)

“How is the language we speak a reflection of our identity?” (Responses will vary.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target:  
‘I can analyze the impact of the author’s use of language variety’?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice (Sentence)

- Students can reflect on the usefulness or importance of studying other language varieties, and complete the following sentence frame. 🖉 Step 5

“The language varieties presented here are worth our attention because \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.” (The language varieties presented here are worth our attention because they allow us to better understand the characters of Two Roads.)

- To provide lighter support: “In what ways is the structure of this sentence different from the structure of the sentence that Possum spoke?”

- To provide heavier support: Invite students to discuss the meaning of the sentence in home language groups before completing the frame in English.
