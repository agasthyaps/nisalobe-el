Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- L.6.1b – Opening A: Students receive direct instruction to help them differentiate between intensive and reflexive pronouns. Then, they complete an entrance ticket in which they add intensive pronouns to sentences about Pop and Possum.

- RL.6.5 – Work Time A: After reading chapter 16 of *Two Roads*, students answer questions about the text, using textual evidence to support their analysis of text structure, character development, and point of view.

- RL.6.1 – Work Time B: Students participate in a Language Dive, using textual evidence to answer questions about a key sentence from the text.

- RL.6.3 – Work Time B: During the Language Dive, students analyze the way in which the author uses Possum’s language varieties to develop Possum’s character in the text.

- L.6.1e – Work Time B: During the Language Dive, students examine Possum’s use of an English language variety.

- RL.6.3 – Closing and Assessment A: Students create a character window to highlight what Possum’s use of language reveals about his character.

- L.6.1e – Closing and Assessment A: On their character windows, students incorporate quotes spoken by Possum in multiple varieties of English.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Students may continue their analysis of Possum by filling out the Analyze Character: *Two Roads* note-catcher for chapters 15 and 16.

- Invite students to make character windows with themselves as the subject. They can give examples of the type of language they use, and then open their window to reveal what their language conveys about their own personality or values. ▲

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In Lesson 11, students began exploring the concept of language variety. Students used examples of Possum’s language variety to make inferences about Possum. In this lesson, students continue to practice recognizing language variation and analyze its impact on the text.

Support All Students

- In chapter 16, Possum briefly alludes to the Trail of Tears, asking “‘You know how us civilized tribes got forced out of the South?’” and adding, “‘Story is that near the end of the trail, the people’s feet were all bloody from the walking’” (p. 175). Consider providing age-appropriate and historically accurate supplementary materials to provide context for these statements.

- Chapter 16 features another of Cal’s visions. The switch from literal to figurative representations may continue to be difficult for developing readers to interpret. Consider pointing out before students begin to read that this chapter includes another description of a vision so that students are prepared for it and less likely to feel confused.

- Work Time B invites students to participate in a Language Dive to examine a sentence uttered by Possum in chapter 16: “Library here ain’t worth an owl’s hoot.” Because Possum is speaking emphatically to his friend Cal, he uses a more familiar variety of English coupled with a unique figurative expression to convey his meaning. Throughout the novel, in other contexts and for other purposes, Possum uses language varieties that one might be more likely to encounter during a classroom discussion or in an academic paper. This Language Dive aims to help students develop a clearer sense of how their own language can effectively and appropriately change according to audience, purpose, and context, including in the classroom, while also uplifting and celebrating Possum’s nimble use of language in *Two Roads*. ▲

- Furthermore, the Language Dive invites students to explore alternative ways in which Possum could have chosen to utter the same message. As students consider these alternatives, emphasize that they are not “correcting” Possum’s original statement; what is most “correct” depends on to whom Possum is speaking, what he is talking about, and the norms and patterns of the larger speaking community of which he is a part. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson builds upon students’ work in Lesson 11 and reinforces learning about varieties of English. Students participate in a Language Dive to explore the sentence “Library here ain’t worth an owl’s hoot,” which Possum says to Cal when asking to borrow one of his books. This Language Dive aims at once to celebrate Possum’s expressive language choices, heighten student awareness of the relationship between language choices and context, and prepare students for the End of Unit 1 Assessment of Lesson 15 by posing questions about language and character development that are structurally identical to questions students will answer on the assessment. The lesson concludes with a character window exercise, which supports reading comprehension with a useful, interactive visual. Students first encountered character windows during Lesson 2. Using familiar activities to tackle new content is especially supportive of ELLs, for whom interpreting and processing instructions for new activities may be particularly challenging. Repeated activities allow students to preserve cognitive energy and apply it to understanding content rather than instructions.

- ELLs may find it challenging to interpret Possum’s language during the Language Dive, especially if his speech conflicts with grammar rules that ELLs have studied. Remind students that no language rules are set in stone; rather, they change according to context, audience, purpose, and speech community. Throughout the Language Dive, try to avoid reinforcing the idea that there is a “right” or “wrong” way to speak, and instead, keep students rooted in the task of figuring out what Possum’s speech says about the development of his character throughout the text.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.2, 6.I.B.3, 6.I.B.6, 6.II.A.1, and 6.II.A.2.

Assessment Guidance

- Collect the Language Dive: *Two Roads*, Page 167 note-catcher to review student progress on character analysis through language variation analysis.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will read chapter 17 of *Two Roads*. Students will continue to analyze Cal’s point of view and how his point of view is developed.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Preread chapter 16 of *Two Roads* to identify potentially challenging vocabulary or plot points.

- Prepare Language Dive: *Two Roads*, Page 167 sentence chunk strips.

- Determine strategic groupings for Closing and Assessment A as students create new character windows.

- Gather paper or card stock, and colored pencils or markers, for students to create character windows.

- Review the Instructions for Character Window (for teacher reference) to ensure clarity while leading the work in Closing and Assessment A.

- Review the procedure for creating character windows in this lesson and identify how it varies from the character windows created in Module 3, Unit 1, Lesson 2.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time B: Record students as they engage in Language Dive discussions. Listen to the recordings later to discuss strengths and what they could improve on or to use as models for the group, especially as students are becoming more independent in leading Language Dives. Most devices (cell phones, tablets, laptop computers) come equipped with free video and audio recording apps or software.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.6.1b (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 13**. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 13 (example for teacher reference)** for possible responses.

- Display and read aloud these four sentences:

- Possum himself made the treasure box.

- Possum made the treasure box himself.

- Possum made the treasure box for himself.

- Possum made himself the treasure box.

- Ask:

“What does each sentence mean?” (The first sentence emphasizes that Possum made the box without any help. The second sentence emphasizes that Possum made the box. The third sentence conveys that Possum didn’t make the box for someone else; he made it just for himself. The fourth sentence conveys the same thing as the second one.)

“What happens to the structure and meaning of each sentence if you remove the pronoun from each?” (Sentences 1 and 2 still make sense and communicate the same idea as they do without the pronoun. Sentence 3 is incomplete without the pronoun (there is no object of the preposition) and, therefore, doesn’t make sense. Sentence 4 would be missing important information if the pronoun was removed because the reader wouldn’t know he made it for himself and not someone else.)

“What’s something you learned about intensive pronouns in Lesson 12?” (An intensive pronoun can be removed from the sentence, and the sentence would still be complete.)

“If we know that to be true, what can we guess about the pronoun in sentences 3 and 4?” (They are not actually intensive pronouns; they are some other kind.)

- Explain that the - *self* pronouns can function in two ways in a sentence: as an intensive pronoun, which they have been learning about, and as a reflexive pronoun. If they’re not sure which way a pronoun is acting, since the words used are the same, they can see what happens to the sentence if the pronoun is removed. If there is a gap left or the content doesn’t make sense, then the pronoun is likely acting as reflexive. If it can be removed without causing the sentence to be incomplete, then it’s acting as intensive.

- Remind them that our focus is on intensive pronouns, but knowing the difference from reflexive is important to ensure they are using intensive pronouns correctly.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar to or the same as previous lessons. Invite students to choose a habit of character focus for themselves for this lesson.

Work Time

A. Read *Two Roads*, Chapter 16 – RL.6.5 (20 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Read chapter 16 of the text, using **Text Guide: *Two Roads*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students who are ready to read independently or in small groups should be released to this independence. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Students continue to identify how characters in the text demonstrate habits of character. Refer to the **Gist anchor chart: *Two Roads*** **(example for teacher reference)** and **chapter synopsis** as needed, as well as any other appropriate resources.

- Gist: Cal begins a friendship with Possum. Possum teaches him some Indian words; Cal shares his books. Possum shows Cal a safe place to store his valuables to protect them from school staff.

- Direct students to recall the second part of the chapter, starting on page 170 with “Follow me.”

- Ask:

“How does this section of the chapter function within the structure of the novel? How does it help to develop the setting and plot of *Two Roads*?” (Answers will vary, but may include: This part of the chapter introduces a different environment at the school, the woods. This is a very different setting from the grounds of the school that are close by but seem far away for Cal and Possum during this moment. The woods seem to be a place of safety—it’s where Possum keeps his special and valuable items—and a place to remember a different life—both boys find themselves thinking about and sharing moments of their past. The woods provides an escape from the realities of life at school and an opportunity for the boys to be themselves. It seems likely that this new setting might become significant as the book continues.)

“How does the way Cal respond to Possum in this section help to develop our understanding of Cal’s character and his point of view toward Possum?” (Answers will vary, but may include: Cal starts to talk more and open up, letting his guard down for the first time while they’re in the woods. He is beginning to feel that Possum might be his real friend, but he is worried about the rest of the boys that Possum keeps calling “the gang,” and he doesn’t acknowledge the vision he experiences at the end of the chapter, even though he thinks Possum might know it happened. This shows Cal is still being careful and protecting himself, even as he starts to feel more comfortable.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

B. Language Dive: *Two Roads*, Page 167 – RL.6.3, L.6.1e (15 minutes)

- Tell students they will now participate in a Language Dive to analyze the variety of English used by Possum in chapter 16 of ***Two Roads***.

- Reread aloud the excerpt from *Two Roads* starting on page 166 (“I take everything out, place it on the ground . . . ”) and ending on page 167 (“‘I read it three times’.”)

- Focus students on the sentence:

- “Library here ain’t worth an owl’s hoot.”

- Use the **Language Dive Guide: *Two Roads***, **Page 167 (for teacher reference)** and the **Language Dive: *Two Roads***, **Page 167 Sentence Chunk Chart (for teacher reference)** to guide students through a Language Dive conversation about the sentence. Distribute and display the **Language Dive: *Two Roads***, **Page 167 note-catcher**, and the **Language Dive: *Two Roads***, **Page 167 sentence chunk strips**. Reference the **Language Dive: *Two Roads***, **Page 167 note-catcher (example for teacher reference**) as needed.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- As an extension to the Language Dive of Work Time B, challenge students who need lighter support to generate their own Mini Language Dive using another sentence uttered by Possum. This process will help students exercise and solidify their learning surrounding the relationship between a character’s speech and his or her development throughout the text. Some sentences students may wish to use for their Mini Dives are:

- “Can’t have none of us looking like wild Indians and scaring the teachers.” (152)

- “Wasn’t a student took it.” (167)

For Heavier Support

- As an extension to the Language Dive of Work Time B, provide additional opportunities for students who need heavier support to practice using the idioms and phrases introduced in the Dive: *A picture is worth a thousand words; It is worth its weight in gold; A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush; It’s not worth it*. Idioms often contain a great deal of embedded cultural information; interpreting and practicing them can be a challenging but playful exercise for ELLs.

Closing and Assessment

A. Character Window: Possum – RL.6.3, L.6.1e (5 minutes)

- Tell students that they are going to participate in a modified version of the Character Window activity that they first encountered in lesson 2. Remind students that character windows help readers visualize the way that a character’s words and actions can reveal something about who they are.

- Explain that students are going to develop a character window to examine Possum’s language use and explain what it reveals about his character.

- Group students into triads. Display the **Instructions for Character Window (for teacher reference)** to guide students in constructing their own windows. Distribute a half sheet of **card stock or construction paper** and **colored pencils or markers**. Direct groups to fold the paper in half widthwise. Invite groups to make a simple drawing of a window on the outside of the paper. Remind students of how they should be able to “open” the window to reveal the blank side underneath by lifting up the top layer.

- On the outside window, invite students to write a meaningful quote from Possum. This example could be the Language Dive sentence from Work Time B (“Library here ain’t worth an owl’s hoot”). Or, for other examples, students can skim and scan sections of chapter 16, or they can refer to the **Possum Quotes Sentence Strips** from Lesson 11.

- On the other window pane, students should indicate the context in which Possum said that quote. Context can include audience (To whom was Possum speaking?), content (What was he talking about?), and/or purpose (What was he trying to do?). The context can be a short sentence or a series of phrases (e.g., speaking to Cal about the gang; following Superintendent Morrell’s instructions). Refer to **Analyze Language: Possum note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** from Lesson 11 for the types of evidence students should note.

- “Open” the window by lifting up the window flap. On the underside, or inside of the window, triads should write what Possum’s quote reveals about his character. Refer to Part III of Analyze Language: Possum note-catcher (example for teacher reference) for the types of inferences students should note.

- Circulate and monitor, clarifying any misconceptions. Once triads have finished constructing their character windows, invite groups to share. Display the character windows around the room.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their habit of character focus for this lesson.

Homework

A. Analyze Structure and Practice Pronouns: *Two Roads*, Chapter 16

- Students complete **Homework: Analyze Structure and Practice Pronouns: *Two Roads***, **Chapter 16**.

B. Preread Anchor Text
