Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RL.6.3 – Opening A: Students add to their Analyze Character: *Two Roads* note-catchers with information about how Cal responds to challenges in chapter 9 of the text.

- RL.6.1 – Work Time B: Students participate in a Language Dive, using textual evidence to answer questions about a key sentence from the text.

- RL.6.4 – Work Time B: During the Language Dive, students determine the meaning of words as they are used in the text.

- RL.6.6 – Work Time B: During the Language Dive, students analyze the way in which a key sentence from the text helps develop the plot of *Two Roads*.

- L.6.5a – Work Time B: During the Language Dive, students interpret a simile from the text.

- L.6.5c – Work Time B: During the Language Dive, students distinguish among the connotations of words with similar denotations.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- In Grade 7, RL.3 asks students to analyze how particular elements of a story interact (e.g., how setting shapes characters or plot). Encourage students who are ready to expand their discussion of character development by adding this extra step of analyzing how different story elements interact.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Students have been practicing identifying a character’s point of view towards a particular topic. They have learned that point of view is one way that an author develops a character. Students continue to analyze how Cal’s character is developed in the chapters they read for this lesson.

Support All Students

- In Modules 3 and 4, Language Dive goals remain the same. However, Language Dives in Modules 3–4 are designed for gradual release from Modules 1–2. As such, the process and materials have been modified. Please see the Language Dive Guide in Lesson 9 for complete details. ▲

- In Chapter 10, one character casually mentions shooting a horse to put it down (117). This passage may be particularly upsetting to students who feel uncomfortable reading about violence against animals. Encourage students to empathize with Cal, who also expresses feeling bothered by the idea of putting down an animal in that way.

- In Chapter 11, Cal continues to struggle with questions of identity after learning that he is half Creek Indian. He says, “Pop says I’m Indian. But I’ve never felt like an Indian, never thought of myself that way. I just want to be myself” (124). The idea that identity can be multi-faceted, conflicting, and complicated may ring true for some students. The debrief during Closing and Assessment A offers students the opportunity to explore some of these ideas in a safe way. Give students the opportunity to share their thoughts with small groups, but do not require them to do so.

- On page 127, Pop differentiates between a “White man handshake” and an “Indian handshake,” commenting on ideas of power, competition, and trust. For some students, especially White students unaccustomed to discussing race, talking about Whiteness and its implications so openly may feel uncomfortable. Be patient, encourage reflection, and stay rooted in the text.

- In these chapters, one character uses the word “Damnation” (117) and Pop uses the phrase “one hell of a lot” (122). Some students may be offended by this language. Explain that the author chooses dialogue that represents the character; in this case, as it is spoken by Pop to Cal, it is not intended to be offensive. If students are reading aloud, permit them to skip or replace that word, if they prefer.

- To support ELLs, this lesson features the first Language Dive of Module 3. Students examine an evocative simile from chapter 11 of *Two Roads*, which the author uses to help convey Cal’s point of view toward critical new information that he is receiving from his father. Suggested questions built into the Language Dive are structurally identical to questions students will encounter on the End of Unit 1 Assessment of Lesson 15, providing opportunities for practice that are so critical for ELLs.

- ELLs may find it challenging to navigate the new process introduced during the Language Dive, as it requires a great deal of autonomy. Encourage students to be selective in how they spend their time during small-group portions of the Language Dive, and remind them that they may not have a chance to discuss all of the possible questions. Group students strategically to ensure that ELLs are paired with supportive and proficient peers who can help to guide the analysis within the Dive and the process itself.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.2, 6.I.B.6, and 6.II.B.1.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ answers in the next row of their Analyze Character: *Two Roads* note-catcher handout to track progress towards RL.6.3. While Cal will face questions about his identity throughout the novel, encourage students to represent a variety of challenges on the note-catcher.

- Review the Module 3 Overview document for sample responses to the module guiding questions. Remember that Guiding Questions are meant to lead students to enduring understanding of broader issues and fundamental understandings and avoid a single “right answer.”

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will read chapter 12 in *Two Roads* and continue practicing RL.6.5 by tracking how this chapter fits into the story as a whole.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Preread chapters 10 and 11 of *Two Roads* to identify potentially challenging vocabulary or plot points.

- Review the new materials used in this lesson to ensure clarity about what students will need to know and be able to do.

- Review the Roving Reporters activity from Closing and Assessment A. Determine in advance which students are best equipped to choose the most insightful responses to the module guiding questions and assign them as the Roving Reporters.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Closing and Assessment A: Create the Module Guiding Questions anchor chart in an online format such as http://eled.org/0158 to share with families. Encourage parents to join the discussion of and reflection on these questions by adding their own responses on the digital anchor chart.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RL.6.3 (5 minutes)

- Direct students to retrieve their **Analyze Character: *Two Roads*** **note-catcher** and anchor text, ***Two Roads***. Instruct students to fill in the row for chapter 9, recalling the reading they did in the previous lesson. Remind students to reference the text for evidence rather than relying on memory. Use **equity** **sticks** to call on students to share their entries. Refer to **Analyze Character: *Two Roads*** **note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar to or the same as previous lessons. Invite students to choose a habit of character focus for themselves for this lesson.

Work Time

A. Read *Two Roads*, Chapters 10 and 11 – RL.6.1 (20 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Read chapters 10 and 11 of the text, using **Text Guide:** ***Two Roads*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students who are ready to read independently or in small groups should be released to this independence. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Students continue to identify how characters in the text demonstrate habits of character. Refer to the **Gist anchor chart: *Two Roads*** **(example for teacher reference)** and **Synopsis: *Two Roads***, **Chapters 10 and 11** as needed, as well as any other appropriate resources.

- Gist of chapter 10: Cal and Pop demonstrate their talent for handling horses. Their help wrangling the horses earns them a meal.

- Gist of chapter 11: Pop teaches Cal about survival at Indian school—march properly, eat quickly, and fight fairly. Cal continues to struggle with his half-Indian identity.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

B. Language Dive: Analyze Language and Point of View – RL.6.6 (15 minutes)

- Tell students they will now participate in a Language Dive to analyze the ways in which the author develops Cal’s point of view toward Challagi school and his Creek identity in chapter 11 of *Two Roads*. Tell students that the process of Language Dives in Modules 3 and 4 will be different from the Language Dive process of earlier modules.

- Turn and Talk:

“What do you remember about teacher and student roles in the most recent Language Dive from Module 2?” (It was teacher-led, with the teacher asking questions about the sentence chunk strips and the students responding.)

- Let students know that, going forward, they will be invited to be more independent as they think and discuss the chunks in their groups. Reassure students that they will continue to be supported as they grapple in the Language Dive.

- Using a total participation technique, invite responses from the group:

“Think about our work with Language Dives. What questions do we ask about the sentences? What questions do we ask about the chunks? What questions do we ask about the words?” Tell students they will be given time to think and discuss with their partner. (Responses will vary.)

- As students share out, capture their responses on the **Questions We Can Ask During a Language Dive anchor chart**. Refer to the **Questions We Can Ask During a Language Dive anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** as necessary. Ensure students understand how to use these questions, pointing out that the questions underlined on the anchor chart are questions that students should always ask when they dive into a sentence.

- Say:

“How will thinking of our own questions for a Language Dive help us during a Language Dive?” Tell students they will be given time to think and discuss with a partner. (The questions will support our thinking about important language features in the sentence.)

- Tell students they will now begin the Language Dive. Reread aloud the excerpt from *Two Roads* on page 123 from “Behind us, the horses are making soft sounds . . . ” and ending at “ . . . like a knotted rope in my belly.”

- Focus students on the sentence:

- “My head is throbbing and there’s a sensation like a knotted rope in my belly.”

- Use the **Language Dive Guide: *Two Roads***, **Page 123 (for teacher reference)** and the **Language Dive: *Two Roads***, **Page 123 Sentence Chunk Chart (for teacher reference)** to guide students through a Language Dive conversation about the sentence. Distribute and display the **Language Dive: *Two Roads***, **Page 123 note-catcher**, and the **Language Dive: *Two Roads***, **Page 123 sentence chunk strips**. Refer to the **Language Dive: *Two Roads***, **Page 123 note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Invite students to Think-Pair-Share:

“Now that we have completed our first new Language Dive, what additional questions should we add to our Questions We Ask During a Language Dive anchor chart?” (Responses will vary.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- As an extension to the Language Dive in Work Time B and to reinforce work with L.6.3a, invite students who need lighter support to more deeply explore the function and meaning of the non-referential *there* in the chunk “ *and there’s a sensation* ” (123). Provide students with the following excerpt from chapter 4 of *Two Roads* and challenge students to determine the difference in meaning and function of the examples of *there*.

- “<u>There</u> is sage <u>there</u> and grasses you do not see in the East or the South . . . ” (47) (The first *there* in this sentence does not refer to any place in particular, it just indicates that something exists; the second *there* is talking specifically about a place.)

For Heavier Support

- As an extension to the Language Dive in Work Time B, invite students who need heavier support to explore the structure of the progressive aspect in the chunk “ *My head is throbbing* ” (123). Extract other examples from *Two Roads* written in the progressive aspect and work with students to deduct general “rules” for generating sentences in the progressive aspect. These sentences may include:

- My head is throbbing. (123)

- I’m leaning against the rough pinewood wall. (120)

- The train is rolling across an endless expanse of brown and yellow plains. (120)

- Some things are making sense, though. (105)

Closing and Assessment

A. Debrief: Module Guiding Questions (5 minutes)

- Distribute sticky notes, one per student. Direct students to the **Module Guiding Questions anchor chart**. Explain that now that students have built some background information about this historical time period and the novel, they are ready to start generating responses to the guiding questions.

- Invite students to choose one guiding question about which they feel strongly. Students should record their initial answer to the question on their sticky note. Remind students that guiding questions are meant to have multiple answers and interpretations; it is fine if their thoughts on the question are still evolving. Instruct students not to write their names on the sticky notes.

- Select three students to be the “Roving Reporters” who refrain from answering the questions at this stage.

- When students have finished writing, invite them to stick their response to the anchor chart next to the question they answered. Direct the Roving Reporters to read each of the sticky notes silently and look for one or two particularly strong or insightful responses to share aloud.

- Tell students that they will return to the questions throughout the module to update their answers and demonstrate new learning.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their habit of character focus for this lesson.

Homework

A. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread chapter 12 in *Two Roads* in preparation for studying this chapter in the next lesson.
