Launch

This Language Dive builds upon students’ understanding of figurative language and asks them to examine the ways in which a simile helps develop both the plot and a key character’s point of view toward his circumstances. Consider reviewing Language Dives from previous modules that featured figures of speech (e.g., Module 1, Unit 1, Lessons 9–10; Module 2, Unit 1, Lesson 7) in order to re-acquaint students with useful terminology.

My head is throbbing

Deconstruct

- **is throbbing**

“What does the ‘is verb + -ing’ structure tell us about this chunk?” (This structure tells us that this chunk is written in the present progressive; the action expressed in the chunk is ongoing and happening in this moment.)

“Can you figure out why the author chose to use the word throbbing, rather than another word with a similar denotation, like aching or hurting?” The word throbbing generally describes headaches that are more intense, or more rhythmic (i.e., with pain that starts and stops repeatedly). Aching and hurting are more general descriptions of pain.

and there’s a sensation

Deconstruct

- **sensation**

“What are the differences in connotation and denotation between the word sensation and a similar word, like feeling? Can you figure out why the author chose the word sensation?” (The author probably wanted to make it clear that he is describing a physical feeling. The word sensation is generally used to describe the way something in your body feels, while the word feeling can describe something physical or emotional.)

like a knotted rope in my belly.

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Ask:

“What do you want to discuss about this chunk? Refer to the Questions We Can Ask during a Language Dive anchor chart and Conversation Cues anchor chart for support.”

- **like**

“What does the word like tell us about this chunk?” (Like indicates that this chunk contains a simile, compares two things.)

- **a knotted rope in my belly**

“What is the relationship between the words knotted and rope in this chunk?” (Knotted is an adjective that modifies and gives more information about the noun rope.)

- Students can close their eyes and picture a knotted rope, sketch a knotted rope on their note-catchers, or tie a piece of rope or a shoelace into knots. 🖉 Step 3

- Say:

“Imagine that there was a knotted rope in your belly. What do you think that physical sensation feels like?” (It might feel like an upset stomach.)

“What kind of emotions do you think would accompany this physical sensation? List some of these emotions on your note-catcher.” (Some emotions that might accompany this sensation are anxiety, worry, concern, and confusion.) 🖉 Step 4

“In this chapter, why is Cal having emotions that cause him to experience this physical sensation?” (Pop is telling Cal about his Creek identity and preparing him to attend Challagi boarding school. Cal is confused by this information and does not want to separate from Pop to attend the school.)

Practice (Focus Structure)

- On my birthday, there’s a sensation like \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ in my belly. 🖉 Step 5

- To provide lighter support: Challenge students to make this sentence more complex by adding on another clause that begins with **and**, **so**, or **but**.

- To provide heavier support: Invite students to discuss the meaning of the sentence in home language groups.

My head is throbbing and there’s a sensation like a knotted rope in my belly.

Reconstruct

- Ask:

“Can you figure out why the author didn’t use parallel structure in this sentence (e.g., My head is throbbing and my belly is aching)? Why did the author use the phrase there’s a sensation instead?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to recognize that this may indicate that Cal is distancing himself from what he is feeling; he is not sure how to identify how he is feeling; the physical sensation to him is clearer than the emotional feeling that accompanies it.)

“Think about the new information Pop is giving Cal, about his Creek identity and about Challagi school. How does this simile help to develop Cal’s point of view toward this information?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to understand that this simile emphasizes the intense confusion, anxiety, and disorientation that Cal is feeling. He feels overwhelmed and uncomfortable by what Pop is telling him. This simile shows the physical effects of that discomfort.)

“How does this sentence help to develop the plot of Two Roads?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to understand that this sentence introduces a key conflict. Cal is learning things about his identity that are new to him. He is about to attend a school that he does not wish to attend.)

- **Students can use Conversation Cues as they discuss. To provide heavier support, display a suggested sequence, such as the one below:**

- Goal 1: Let’s take time to think and write or sketch.

- Goal 1: So do you mean \_\_\_\_?

- Goal 3. Why do you think that?

- Goal 4: How is what \_\_\_\_ said different from what \_\_\_\_ said?

- Ask:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target:  
‘I can analyze Cal’s point of view in chapters 10 and 11 and how it is developed by the author’?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice (Sentence)

- Cal’s stomach is \_\_\_\_ and there’s a sensation like \_\_\_ in his head. 🖉 Step 6

- To provide lighter support: “What if this sentence describes how Cal felt at some point in the past?”

- To provide heavier support: Invite students to discuss the meaning of the sentence in home language groups. Add the nouns in students’ home languages to the Parts of Speech anchor chart.
