Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- L.6.5c – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they interpret the connotation of a phrase from the text.

- RI.6.7 – Work Time A: Students participate in a Chalk Talk, in order to analyze and record their feelings about a series of photos that visually depict information conveyed in excerpts of the Meriam Report, which students read in the previous lesson.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time B: Students use evidence from excerpts of the Meriam Report to answer questions about the report.

- RI.6.7 – Work Time B: Students work in small groups to integrate information from the Meriam Report with information from the photos they examined in Work Time A.

- RI.6.7 – Closing and Assessment A: Students complete a QuickWrite in which they summarize overarching connections between the photos of early American Indian boarding schools and the excerpts of the Meriam Report.

- In this lesson, students engage in a protocol. A protocol consists of agreed-upon, detailed guidelines for reading, recording, discussing, or reporting that ensure equal participation and accountability in learning. Protocols are an important feature of our curriculum because they are one of the best ways we know to engage students in discussion, inquiry, critical thinking, and sophisticated communication. Students engage in the following new protocol in this lesson (instructions for which appear at the first point of use):

- Chalk Talk: A Chalk Talk invites students to respond silently and in writing to an important, open-ended question. Responses are collected in a central place, such as a piece of chart paper. Chalk Talks promote discussion and awareness of issues, perspectives, or academic challenges and to demonstrate knowledge of a topic. Chalk Talks bypass the social roadblocks that often impede classroom communication and ensure that all voices are heard. Their built-in processing time is also especially supportive for ELLs.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- This lesson nurtures students’ abilities to integrate information presented in photos and in text in order to develop a deeper understanding of a topic. To help students further recognize the relationship between information presented in text versus that presented visually, invite students’ to visit websites such as http://eled.org/0195. Intriguing photos are provided, initially without captions, and a moderated online conversation is available for students to discuss what they think is happening in the photos. Textual information about the photo is then made available, which students can compare against and integrate with their own interpretations of the pictures. Although this exercise may be useful and fun for all students, it may be especially valuable for ELLs, as it invites exploration of new vocabulary and formulaic language structures (e.g., I notice \_\_\_\_; I wonder \_\_\_\_). ▲

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students read four short excerpts from the Meriam Report, which students, in this lesson, reflect upon using visual information from related photos. Students first practiced integrating information presented through different media in Module 2, when they interpreted videos, texts, and graphics on the same topic: critical problems and their design solutions.

Support All Students

- Note that there is a differentiated version of the Integrate Information: Photos and the Meriam Report handout used in Work Time B in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- In this lesson, students have the opportunity to return to the excerpts of *The Problem of Indian Administration* (also known as the Meriam Report) that they read in the previous lesson. In this lesson, students examine connections among their excerpts and four related photos. In Unit 2, students will analyze a longer passage from the Meriam Report during a close read. Revisiting the same text multiple times for different purposes supports students’ reading comprehension and is especially useful for ELLs, for whom repeated exposure to complex vocabulary and language structures supports retention. ▲

- The photos featured in Work Time A and B depict the poor treatment of students and the poor condition of facilities at American Indian boarding schools. Although these photos are not graphic, visually processing this content may be more upsetting for students than reading about it. Facilitate spaces (e.g., through a private writing exercise or paired discussion) for students to reflect and share their feelings.

- If students were absent during the previous lesson, they can still participate in the Chalk Talk of Work Time A and record what they notice and think about when they look at the posters. During Work Time B, these students may wish to work independently to read the excerpts of the Meriam Report for the first time.

- To support ELLs, this lesson features a Chalk Talk protocol, which gives students time to process content and solidify ideas privately before sharing them aloud. Also in this lesson, students return to the excerpts of the Meriam Report that they first read during the Jigsaw protocol of the previous lesson. Revisiting the same text multiple times for multiple purposes, especially a dense primary source like the Meriam Report, helps students become stronger, more critical, and more confident readers.

- If ELLs struggled to interpret excerpts of the Meriam Report in the previous lesson, they may find it challenging to connect the content of those excerpts to related images in Work Time B. Remind students that the purpose of this activity is to use information from multiple sources to better understand a topic overall; in other words, the photos are meant to work *with* the Meriam Report and illuminate its content. With this in mind, it may be fruitful to make available smaller versions of the photos used in Work Time A so students can refer to them readily while completing their Integrate Information: Photos and the Meriam Report handouts during Work Time B.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.2, 6.I.A.4, and 6.I.B.6.

Assessment Guidance

- This is the last lesson before the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment. Ensure that students have had enough practice with connotation, figurative language, and integrating information from different media before the assessment. As necessary, isolate discrete skills students still need practice with to shore up any misunderstandings.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will take the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment. In the second half of Unit 1, students continue reading *Two Roads* and analyze point of view and the development of plot in the text.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare the resources for the Chalk Talk protocol in Work Time A.

- Print and cut out the four photos from the Chalk Talk Resources for Work Time A.

- Display the four photos from the Chalk Talk Resources—labeled as photo 1, 2, 3, and 4—around the room, either on walls or at “stations” of desks pushed together.

- Next to each photo, post a piece of chart paper, with the following two questions written in bold: *What do you notice about this photo? What does this photo make you think about?* Write the first question at the top of the chart paper, and the second about halfway down, leaving room under each question.

- Gather different-colored pencils or markers.

- Review the Jigsaw groups from the previous lesson, as they will be reconvening in Work Time B.

- Review the student tasks and example answers to get familiar with what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Prepare copies of handouts for students, including entrance ticket (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.6.5c (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 6**. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 6 (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar to or the same as previous lessons. Invite students to choose a habit of character focus for themselves for this lesson.

Work Time

A. Analyze Photos: Chalk Talk – RI.6.7 (15 minutes)

- Explain that students will be participating in a Chalk Talk to share their ideas and reflections about four photos. These photos depict some of the information that students read about in the Meriam Report in the previous lesson.

- Ensure students understand the directions for a Chalk Talk. (Refer to the Classroom Protocols document for the full version of the protocol.)

- Display the **Chalk Talk Resources**, and distribute **colored pencils or markers** to each student.

- Direct students to rotate among the four photos and the pieces of chart paper. Students should silently and carefully examine the photos, and then write answers to the questions on each chart paper. Make it clear that everyone is responsible for writing their own comments, reading others’ comments, and responding to at least one to three comments on every chart paper. All comments should be thoughtful and further the discussion.

- This technique works only if everyone is writing and responding throughout the designated time period and remains silent throughout. No one should sit down until the time period is over.

- As needed during the Chalk Talk, walk around, read, and gently point students to interesting comments.

- Refocus whole group. Think-Pair-Share:

“What patterns and themes do you notice across the comments?”

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- During the Chalk Talk of Work Time A, invite students who need lighter support to “code” the written responses they see on the chart paper in order to track recurrent themes or ideas they see. This information can be shared with the class or synthesized into summary statements.

For Heavier Support

Work Time

B. Integrate Photos and the Meriam Report – RI.6.7 (20 minutes)

- Distribute and display the **Integrate Information: Photos and the Meriam Report** handout or the optional **Integrate Information: Photos and the Meriam Report** ▲. Explain that this handout is meant to help them elaborate on connections between the photographs they saw during Work Time A and the excerpts of the Meriam Report that they read in Lesson 6. Tell students that you will complete the first pair of sentence frames together, and then they will complete the remaining three frame pairs in small groups.

- Draw students’ attention to the first item on the **Integrate Information: Photos and the Meriam Report** handout, which contains excerpt A. Invite students to follow along on their own handouts as you reread excerpt A aloud.

- Turn and Talk:

“Which of the photos—photo 1, 2, 3, or 4—most closely relates to the content of excerpt A? How do you know?” (Photo 4 relates to excerpt A because it illustrates the kind of simple and bland food that students may have eaten. It gives a better sense of the small amounts of food students were eating.)

- Students may refer to their **Jigsaw: Meriam Report task cards** and/or their **Analyze Point of View: Meriam Report note-catcher** from the previous lesson to review their notes about the excerpts of the Meriam Report.

- Draw student attention back to the first item on the **Integrate Information: Photos and the Meriam Report** handout and have them fill in the first sentence frame (“Photo \_\_\_ shows . . . ”). In the second excerpt A frame, “This photo relates to this excerpt because . . . ”, model completing the sentence with students’ ideas as students complete the sentence on their handouts. Refer to the **Integrate Information: Photos and the Meriam Report (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Field student questions about this activity as needed. Invite students to return to their heterogeneous Jigsaw groups from the previous lesson to complete the remaining sentence frames on their own. As students work, monitor their collaboration and progress completing the frames. If productive, cue students to expand the conversation with their groups:

“Do you agree or disagree with what your classmate said? Why?”

“How is what \_\_\_\_ said the same as/different from what \_\_\_\_ said?”

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time B, invite students who need heavier support to use the Integrate Information: Photos and the Meriam Report ▲ handout. This resource highlights, in bold, key sentences from the excerpts of the Meriam Report to hone students’ attention to central ideas.

Closing and Assessment

A. QuickWrite: Reflect on the Meriam Report – RI.6.7 (5 minutes)

- Distribute **QuickWrite: Reflect on the Meriam Report**. Remind students that the goal of a QuickWrite is to get their ideas on the page without pausing to edit for conventions. Encourage students to write continuously for the allotted time. Refer to **QuickWrite: Reflect on the Meriam Report (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- With one minute remaining, refocus whole group.

- Collect the handout. Scan student responses and make a note of students who might need support. Check in with them moving forward.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their habit of character focus for this lesson.

Homework

A. Integrate Information

- Students complete **Homework: Integrate Information** to better understand events in *Two Roads*, Chapter 4.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
