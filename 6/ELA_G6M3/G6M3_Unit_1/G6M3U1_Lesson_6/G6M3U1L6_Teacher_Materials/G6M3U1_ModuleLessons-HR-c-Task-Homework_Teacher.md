How do these images help a reader to better understand the excerpt of *Two Roads* and why Pop thought he needed to go to Washington? (RL.6.1, RL.6.3, RI.6.1, RI.6.7, W.6.10)

These pictures helped me to understand that the Bonus Army was a real and serious event. This helps to explain why Pop made the tough decision of sending Cal to Challagi. In the pictures, I see very large crowds of people in an orderly march that looks like a parade. I also noticed that the men were living in makeshift camps there, just as described in *Two Roads*. I was really struck by the delivery of the petition signed by 1,000,000 soldiers. This shows the urgency and strong feelings of the veterans who were experiencing hardship after fighting for the country in World War I. This was not a small movement. These pictures helped me understand why Pop felt he needed to go and help his fellow soldiers. So many veterans were part of this process. There was a chance to make a real change and get the funds they so desperately needed. Pop and Cal could lead a better life with that money, especially since this was during the Great Depression. They also help me understand why Pop felt he shouldn’t take Cal with him. With the large crowds, strong emotions, and uncertain living conditions, Pop probably made the best choice to keep Cal safe by sending him to school.
