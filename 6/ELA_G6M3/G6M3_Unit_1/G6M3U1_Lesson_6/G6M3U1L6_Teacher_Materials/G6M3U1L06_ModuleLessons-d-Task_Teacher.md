**Directions:** Fill in the sentence frames to identify relationships between the photos you examined previously and the excerpts from the Meriam Report, which you read in the previous lesson. Use evidence from the text and the photos to support your ideas.

**Excerpt A from the Meriam Report**

“The survey staff finds itself obliged to say frankly and unequivocally that the provisions for the care of the Indian children in boarding schools are grossly inadequate. The outstanding deficiency is in the diet furnished the Indian children, many of whom are below normal health. **The diet is deficient in quantity, quality, and variety.** The effort has been made to feed the children on a per capita of eleven cents a day, plus what can be produced on the school  
farm. . .”

Relationship to Photo:

Photo **4** shows **students peeling potatoes at an American Indian boarding school.**

This photo relates to this excerpt because **it illustrates the kind of simple and bland food**

**that students ate at school.**

**Excerpt B from the Meriam Report**

“**The boarding schools are crowded materially beyond their capacities.** A device frequently resorted to in an effort to increase dormitory capacity without great expense, is the addition of large sleeping porches. They are in themselves reasonably satisfactory, but they shut off light and air from the inside rooms, which are still filled with beds beyond their capacity.”

Relationship to Photo:

Photo **1** shows **a huge group of students sitting together in a large room of an American**

**Indian boarding school.**

This photo relates to this excerpt because **it reinforces how overcrowded these schools**

**are. Seeing the school’s population in a visual way really drives home the idea that these**

**schools were filled beyond capacity.**

**Excerpt C from the Meriam Report**

“The boarding schools are frankly supported in part by the labor of the students. **Those above the fourth grade ordinarily work for half a day and go to school for half a day.** The question may very properly be raised as to whether much of the work of Indian children in boarding schools would not be prohibited in many states by the child labor laws . . .”

Relationship to Photo:

Photo **2** shows **young students working on a farm and being supervised by an adult who**

**seems to be commanding them.**

This photo relates to this excerpt because **it shows that students at American Indian**

**boarding schools often worked long days and provided labor that supported the schools.**

**This image illustrates just how young these students are. This demonstrates that child**

**labor laws were violated at these schools.**

**Excerpt D from the Meriam Report**

“**The uniform curriculum works badly because it does not permit of relating teaching to the needs of the particular Indian children being taught.** It requires the same work for Indian children who are the first generation to attend school and who do not speak English as it does for those who are of the third generation of school children, who have long been in contact with the whites, and speak English in the home.”

Photo **3** shows **groups of students working in different ways in the classroom.**

This photo relates to this excerpt because **it highlights the fact that the curriculum was**

**inadequate for the needs of the students and different from the way they were used to**

**being taught.**
