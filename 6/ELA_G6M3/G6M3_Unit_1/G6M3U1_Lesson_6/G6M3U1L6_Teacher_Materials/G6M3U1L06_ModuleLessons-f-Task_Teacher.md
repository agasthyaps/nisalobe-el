(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Answer the questions below. Refer to your Integrate Information: Photos and the Meriam Report handout as needed.

What information about early American Indian boarding schools do these images provide? How do they connect to key ideas in the excerpts of the Meriam Report?

Answers will vary, but may include: The images provide visual information about students’ living conditions at American Indian boarding schools. This means things like the food they ate, how they worked, how many students were at one school, and what their classrooms looked like. The central idea of the Meriam Report excerpts we read is that these schools do not often take good care of their students. Although these photos do not seem to depict major abuses, they support with visual information some of the ideas we read about.
