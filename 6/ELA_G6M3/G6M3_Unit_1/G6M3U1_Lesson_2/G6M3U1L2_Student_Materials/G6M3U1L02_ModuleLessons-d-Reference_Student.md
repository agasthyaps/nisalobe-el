**Name:** **Date:**

**Chapter 4, “News”**

- Cal and Pop leave Mrs. Euler’s home after a big, hearty breakfast. They stop by Jack’s campsite to make sure he is gone.

- Pop and Cal position themselves in the high grass, waiting for the opportunity to jump aboard the next train.

- While waiting, Cal reminisces about his mother’s life and death.

- Cal and Pop jump aboard the train.

- Cal is introduced to a group of gentlemen that Pop knows from riding the rails.

- Pop tells Cal that it is time for Cal to go back to school. Pop breaks the news that he is going to Washington, DC to help other veterans convince the United States government to give veterans their bonus money ahead of time.

- Cal learns he will be attending Indian school.

**Chapter 5, “Indian School”**

- Cal asks Pop if Indian school teaches you how to be an Indian. Pop tells Cal that Indian schools do the exact opposite. Cal is still quite confused.

- Cal remembers a school paper he wrote in which he included information about the Indians that Pop had described in stories. Cal received a failing grade on the paper and Pop had to visit Cal’s teacher and have a conversation. Cal reflects on how he always felt different from the rest of his classmates.

- Pop explains to Cal the history of Indian school and why such schools came into existence.

- Pop reveals that he is Creek Indian, which makes Cal half-Indian.

**Chapter 6, “Hopping Off”**

- Cal is in disbelief. He thinks through all the information about Indians that he had been taught in school. Cal does not associate anything positive with being an Indian.

- Pop explains that there is a lot they must talk about. They cannot talk now because the train is slowing down in Fairville, Arkansas, a town unfriendly toward hoboes. Hoboes will get arrested and thrown in jail if caught.

- Cal and Pop exit the moving train and run into the forest. They cautiously approach a hobo jungle.

- Cal is introduced to Corporal Esom Dart, the black man in partial military uniform who was asleep in the back of the train car Cal and Pop just exited.

- Pop asks Corporal Dart who to speak to in the hobo jungle, and Dart directs them to Cap.

- Pop knows Cap, and he informs Pop and Cal that they are welcome to stay.

**Chapter 7, “A Fine Mulligan”**

- Time for dinner. Cap pulls out a pot. Each person expecting to eat contributes something to the pot. Cap cooks the stew.

- Cap portions out the stew into cups. Everyone eats until the stew is gone.

- Pop offers to wash out the pot and cups, so they head down to the stream.

- When Pop and Cal reach the stream, Pop sets aside the pot and cups in order to continue talking to Cal about being Creek Indian.

- Pop provides Cal with a brief history of Pop’s side of the family.

- Cal asks, “Why didn’t you tell me?” Pop explains that he and Cal’s mother raised him as white to protect him because when you are Indian, people treat you differently.

- Pop recalls a story the older boys told him while at Challagi. Cal finds himself mentally transported into the dormitory experiencing the story as Pop tells it.

- Pop presents his idea to Cal: Pop goes to Washington, DC to convince Congress and President Hoover to give the vets their bonus money. Cal will go to Indian school.

- Cal must decide if he will enroll at Challagi. Pop assures Cal, “. . . if you do not agree then there is no way I am going to force you.”

- Cal expresses that he likes being on the road with his Pop. Cal feels as though they have a good life together.

- Pop explains that life for them is not good at the moment. Pop wants to provide a home for Cal again.

- Pop promises that he will come to the school and get Cal when he’s done in Washington, DC.

- Cal is about to speak, but then there are gunshots.

**Chapter 8, “Gunshots”**

- Pop and Cal jog back to the hobo jungle. They hide behind trees at the edge of the clearing.

- The sheriff is demanding to know where the “vagrant Negro” is that he saw get off of the train.

- A pile of leaves to Cal’s left begins to move. Cal is sure Corporal Esom Dart is hidden under those leaves. Pop tells Corporal Dart to “stay there.”

- Pop emerges from the shadow of the trees and speaks to the sheriff.

- When the sheriff begins questioning Pop, he identifies himself as being “Full-blood Creek out of Muskogee, Oklahoma.” Pop also shows the army papers in his pocket with his name.

- After further questioning from the Sheriff, Pop discloses that he is taking his son to Indian school. Sheriff asks Pop to bring out the boy.

- Cal converses with the sheriff and is extremely polite. The sheriff briefly questions Cal and is satisfied with the situation, so the sheriff and his group of men depart.

- All the men work to put out the fire the sheriff set to one of the men’s shelters.

- After the fire is extinguished, Cal asks whether he should get Corporal Dart, but Pop tells Cal that Dart will be long gone by now.

- Cal spots something shining on the limb of a shrub. Corporal Dart left his France Victory Medal for Cal.
