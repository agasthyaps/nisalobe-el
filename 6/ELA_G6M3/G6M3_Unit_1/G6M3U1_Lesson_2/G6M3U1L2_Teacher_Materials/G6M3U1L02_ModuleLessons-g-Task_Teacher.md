**Based on the Infer the Topic resources from yesterday and our reading today, how do you think this novel will connect to the topic of American Indian boarding schools? Cite specific examples.**

Answers will vary. Sample response: Chapter 5 is titled “Indian School.” This is the chapter when Pop reveals that he is taking Cal to Indian school. Pop explains a little about what happens at Indian boarding schools. Students are treated harshly in an attempt to strip away their Indian identity. Their hair is cut and they are expected to march around like soldiers. Students who spoke their native language were whipped or put in the guardhouse. The connection between the text and the resources we looked at during Infer the Topic is becoming clear. Those resources were all about Indian boarding schools. Many of the resources were primary sources that represented the true historical time period. It seems like the book is going to build a fictional narrative around this true historical event.
