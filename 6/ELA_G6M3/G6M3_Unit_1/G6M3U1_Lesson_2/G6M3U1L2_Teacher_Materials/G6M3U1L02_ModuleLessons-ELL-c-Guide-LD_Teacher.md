5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

RL.6.3, SL.6.1, SL.6.6, L.6.3a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

Now that ***I* am going to Washington**. (from page 59 of *Two Roads* by Joseph Bruchac)

**Lesson 2 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after reading aloud the chapter 4 excerpt during Work Time A, and before students read chapter 5.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target (**I can analyze how Cal responds to and changes due to the events in chapters 4 and 5**) and RL.6.3 by presenting a key plot shift that will change Cal’s life and L.6.3a by highlighting the way in which words can be emphasized to enhance or shift meaning in a sentence. It also helps students to address SL.6.6 by providing an opportunity for students to adapt their speech to different contexts using appropriate intonation. Supporting standards: SL.6.1

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses italicization to denote word emphasis and specify meaning. Also, this sentence contains a common, though not transparent, multiword conjunction (**Now that**).

- Transfer: Emphasizing a single word to highlight meaning in future writing assignments in which students write a letter from Cal’s perspective (e.g., Even if ***I*** want to leave, I know Pop wants me to stay).

- Note: A suggested extension to this Mini Language Dive is described in Lesson 2 of this guide.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: “**Now that <u>*I* am going to Washington</u>**.”

- Say:

“What is this sentence about?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“What do the quotation marks about this sentence indicate? Who said this and to whom?” (That this sentence is a quotation; it was said by Pop to Cal.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: ***I* am going to Washington**.

- Say:

“What do you notice about this chunk?” (Responses will vary.)

“Can you figure out why the author chose to italicize the word I?” (To emphasize it; to indicate Pop’s intonation; to make it clear that Pop will be going to Washington alone.)

“What if the author had italicized a different word in the sentence? How might the meaning change?” (Responses will vary.)

- To support students’ understanding of intonation, display the original chunk alongside two variations in which different words are emphasized:

- **I** am going to Washington.

- I am going to **Washington**.

- I **am** going to Washington.

- Say each sentence aloud, changing your intonation and emphasis according to the italicized word. Invite students to repeat the sentences aloud with a partner, practicing shifts in intonation.

- Say:

“What are the differences in meaning among these sentences? How does the meaning of the sentence change as the emphasis changes?” (Responses will vary.)

- It might be most useful to ask students to produce short follow-up sentences to each of these sentences in order to demonstrate comprehension. For example:

- **I** am going to Washington . . . and **you** are not.

- I am going to **Washington** . . . and not **New York**.

- I **am** going to Washington. You thought I wasn’t, but I **am**.

- If time allows, students may enjoy replicating this exercise with other sentences, whose meanings change based on which words are emphasized (e.g., “She said she loved me”).

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: “**Now that <u>*I* am going to Washington</u>**.”

- Say:

“Who can explain what the conjunction Now that means in this sentence?” (Now that introduces a consequence of an action; it can be compared to the conjunction since.

“Is this a complete or incomplete sentence? How do you know?” (It is a fragment; the sentence begins with a conjunction, which would normally introduce a dependent clause.)

“Can you figure out why the author thought it was acceptable to write this as a fragment rather than as a complete sentence?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to understand that this is a quote and people often speak in fragments; also, literature tends to follow different grammatical rules than academic texts.)

“How does Cal feel as a result of hearing Pop utter this sentence?” (He feels concerned and confused.)

“How does the author’s use of emphasis affect Cal’s response?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to understand that the emphasis on the subject I makes Cal feel excluded.)

“Why do you think this might be an important sentence in the text?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to understand that this is the moment Cal learns that Pop is leaving without him and Cal will attend an American Indian boarding school.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target:  
I can analyze how Cal responds to and changes due to the events in chapters 4 and 5?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to understand that this sentence highlights a key event in the text: the moment at which Cal realizes he will not be going to Washington with Pop. Cal’s responses to this realization reveal important information about Cal’s character and about his relationship to Pop.)

Practice

- Display the following sentences:

- I said I liked the movie. I didn’t love it.

- I said I liked the movie. Can’t you hear me?

- I said I liked the movie, not the book.

- Say:

“For the first part of each bullet (‘I said I liked the movie’), choose the word that you would italicize for emphasis, so that the second part of the sentence makes the most sense. Underline that word. Then, practicing reading these sentences aloud to your partner with appropriate intonation.”

- Possible student answers:

I said I **<u>liked</u>** the movie. I didn’t love it.

I **<u>said</u>** I liked the movie. Can’t you hear me?

I said I liked the **<u>movie</u>**, not the book.
