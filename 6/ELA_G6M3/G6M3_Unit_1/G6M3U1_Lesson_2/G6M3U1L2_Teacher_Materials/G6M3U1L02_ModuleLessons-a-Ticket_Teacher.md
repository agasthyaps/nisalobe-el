Answers will vary. Sample student response:

Pop and Cal are living as hoboes because they lost their farm and are unemployed.

Evidence

1.  The novel takes place during the Great Depression, when many people were like Pop and Cal, without homes or jobs.

2.  When the stock market crashed in 1929, many people became homeless and desperate.

3.  Pop and Cal demonstrate good values so far, so they want to do honest work. The Afterword explains that hoboes at this time, like Pop and Cal, were honest people who wanted to work hard.
