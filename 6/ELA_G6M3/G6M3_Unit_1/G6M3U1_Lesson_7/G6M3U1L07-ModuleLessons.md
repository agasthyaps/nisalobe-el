Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Work Time A: Students complete the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment. They read “The Cutting of My Long Hair,” a new section from Zitkala-Sa’s first-person narrative, which students first saw a different section of during the close read of Lesson 4. Students answer selected response questions about vocabulary and figurative language in the text and about Zitkala-Sa’s point of view and how it is conveyed in the text. Students also answer a constructed response question asking them to integrate ideas from the text with their interpretations of two related photographs. (RI.6.1, RI.6.2, RI.6.4, RI.6.6, RI.6.7, RI.6.10, L.6.5a, L.6.5c)

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners by reading and answering questions independently for the mid-unit assessment. Prompt students’ perseverance by reminding them that assessments are meant to inform instruction. Use assessment data to make choices about what should be retaught and how to adjust the pacing. Encourage students not to be afraid of mistakes; an accurate assessment is crucial for tailoring lessons to students’ needs.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Some students may not need extensive review of the assessment directions. Release them to begin working on the assessment while clarification is provided to other students who need more support.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the first half of this unit, students read excerpts of informational texts and first-person narratives, building background knowledge about American Indian boarding schools and analyzing the author’s point of view and use of connotation and figurative language. This lesson continues those routines in an assessment, asking students to apply their learning to a new section of a first-person narrative that they first read in Lesson 4.

Support All Students

- As with any assessment, students may feel nervous to read new passages independently and answer questions about them. Point out all the preparation they have had through activities, homework, and in-class reading time. Also, remind them there will be other opportunities throughout Module 3 to demonstrate what they have learned.

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study, as well as the goals of the assessment.

- Some students may need the text read aloud before they work on the questions. Consider inviting students who require this to sit in a group away from the rest of the students, so as not to be distracting.

- For some students, this assessment may require more than the 35 minutes allotted. Consider providing time over multiple days if necessary.

- An opportunity to track their progress after the assessment helps students reflect on and celebrate their growth.

- To support ELLs, this lesson invites students to complete assessment tasks similar to the classroom tasks in Lessons 1–6. Students read a narrative by Zitkala-Sa called “The Cutting of My Long Hair,” then answer selected response questions about the text. Although the text is new to students, students are already familiar with the author’s style, as they participated in a close read using another of Zitkala-Sa’s texts, “The Land of Red Apples,” in Lesson 4.

- ELLs may find it challenging to independently complete the mid-unit assessment without scaffolding. Point out that the mid-unit assessment is similar to the activities they have successfully completed in class. Encourage students to do their best, and assure them that they will continue learning together after the assessment.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.8, and 6.II.A.2.

Assessment Guidance

- All assessment materials for Mid-Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Point of View and Integrate Information, are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback on this assessment, use the answer key and sample student responses (see Assessment Overview and Resources) to help complete students’ Track Progress recording form.

- Using information from this assessment, students are tracking progress toward anchor standards:

- R.1: By the end of Grade 12 I will be able to: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.

- R.4: By the end of Grade 12 I will be able to: Interpret words and phrases as they are used in a text, including determining technical, connotative, and figurative meanings, and analyze how specific word choices shape meaning or tone.

- R.10: By the end of Grade 12 I will be able to: Read and comprehend complex literary and informational texts independently and proficiently.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will return to the anchor text, *Two Roads*, at chapter 9 and continue reading. They will begin filling in a note-catcher to guide them in their analysis of point of view and character development.

- Students’ Mid-Unit 1 Assessments will be returned in Lesson 15 with feedback.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare Mid-Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Point of View and Integration Information (see Assessment Overview and Resources).

- Ensure feedback from the Module 2 End of Unit 3 Assessment is ready for Opening A.

- Review the student tasks and example answers to get familiar with what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Prepare copies of handouts for students, including entrance ticket (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous modules to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 7**. Students will also need their **Module 2 End of Unit 3 Assessment with feedback**.

- Once all students are ready, invite them to share their “stars” and “steps” with a partner. Remind students that everyone is working toward individual goals and that learning is about continued growth and development.

- Using a preferred classroom routine, collect or review the answers to **Homework: Integrate Information**. Refer to **Homework: Integrate Information (answers for teacher reference)**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar to or the same as previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Mid-Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Point of View and Integrate Information (35 minutes)

- Distribute **Mid-Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Point of View and Integrate Information**.

- Tell students that for this assessment, they will read a new section, “The Cutting of My Long Hair,” of the first-person narrative by Zitkala-Sa. Remind students that they read a different section of this narrative, “The Land of Red Apples,” during the close read of Lesson 4. In this assessment, students analyze the author’s point of view and integrate information from the text with information from related photos.

- Read the directions for each part of the assessment aloud as students follow along, reading silently. Ensure students understand the directions; paraphrase some instructions, if needed. ▲ Answer students’ questions, but refrain from supplying answers to the assessment questions themselves.

- Direct students’ attention to the following anchor charts:

- **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart**

- **Strategies to Answer Selected Response Questions anchor chart**

- Remind students to refer to these anchor charts as they read the assessment text and answer the assessment questions.

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence. Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart** and review what perseverance looks and sounds like. Remind students that because they will be reading and answering questions independently for the assessment, they may need to practice perseverance.

- Invite students to begin the assessment.

- While they are taking the assessment, circulate to monitor and document their test-taking skills.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- Before the assessment of Work Time A, underline key vocabulary in the assessment directions and prompt and read aloud together as a class to ensure that students understand each task included in the assessment. Invite students who need lighter support to restate or clarify information for students who need heavier support.

For Heavier Support

- Display a “map” of the assessment to reference while explaining directions to the mid-unit assessment. This will reduce ambiguity and give students a clearer picture of what they can expect so that they can better allocate their time and attentional resources. Example:

- Read “The Cutting of My Long Hair.” Then answer the questions.

- Questions 1 and 2: Use text evidence to determine the author’s point of view.

- Questions 3 and 4: Use understanding of word connotation to determine the author’s point of view.

- Question 5: Use understanding of figurative language to determine the author’s point of view.

- Question 6: Determine a central idea of the text.

- Question 7: Examine photos related to the text and explain how they connect to a central idea.

Closing and Assessment

A. Track Progress – RI.6.1 (5 minutes)

- Give students specific, positive feedback on their completion of the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment.

- Distribute **Track Progress folders**, **Track Progress: Read, Understand, and Explain New Text, Writing Record**, and **sticky notes**.

- Tell students the sticky notes are for them to find evidence of the following criteria:

- RI.6.1

- RI.6.4

- L.6.4

- Guide students through completing the form. Encourage students to orally paraphrase the meaning of the Track Progress criteria, self-assess, and discuss the evidence with a partner before they begin writing. Direct students to complete Writing Record for the writing they did as part of the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment (QuickWrite to integrate understanding of topic).

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their habit of character focus for this lesson.

Homework

A. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread chapter 9 in *Two Roads* in preparation for studying this chapter in the next lesson.
