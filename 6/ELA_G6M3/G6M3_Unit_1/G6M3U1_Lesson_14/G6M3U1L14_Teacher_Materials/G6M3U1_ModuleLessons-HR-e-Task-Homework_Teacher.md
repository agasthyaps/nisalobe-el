How does this section contribute to the development of the plot and characters of *Two Roads*? (RL.6.1, RL.6.3, RL.6.5, W.6.10)

This section solidifies the bond between Possum and Cal. This bond is important to the plot because Pop is about to leave the school and Cal will be alone. Throughout the chapter, Possum shows willingness to trust Cal. Possum takes Cal to a special place in the woods and shows him all the items he keeps hidden. Sharing his most special item, the Cherokee rose, and the story about it conveys just how much Possum values Cal. This story triggers another vision for Cal. Cal finds himself in the past this time, walking on the Trail of Tears with the Cherokee. Cal and Possum share a serious moment thinking about this other horrific moment in Native American history. The chapter ends with Cal putting his France Victory Medal into the box next to Possum’s Cherokee rose.
