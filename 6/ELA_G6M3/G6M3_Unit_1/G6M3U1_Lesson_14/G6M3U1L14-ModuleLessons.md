Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RL.6.2 – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they identify possible emerging themes of *Two Roads*.

- RL.6.1 – Work Time A: After reading chapter 17 of *Two Roads*, students answer questions about the text, using textual evidence to support their analysis of text structure and theme.

- RL.6.2 – Work Time A: Students answer questions about the way in which chapter 17 contributes to the development of a possible theme of *Two Roads*.

- RL.6.5 – Work Time A: Students answer questions about the way in which chapter 17 functions within the overall structure of the novel.

- RL.6.6 – Work Time B: Students participate in a Final Word protocol to examine Cal’s point of view toward Challagi. Then, they add to their Analyze Point of View: *Two Roads* note-catchers.

- During Closing and Assessment A, students are guided through a research reading share to hold them accountable for their research reading homework. Consider using Independent Reading Sample Plans (from online Tools page: http://eled.org/tools) if not using other independent reading review routines (RI.6.10, SL.6.1).

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become ethical people by showing integrity as they share and discuss the independent reading they have been doing regularly for homework.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Independent Research Reading sharing is a great opportunity to experiment with fun, new tools as students share what they have learned from their independent reading. Consider allowing students to explore exciting resources, such as http://eled.org/0197. Give students agency to come up with imaginative ways to use these resources to express how their understanding of the module topic was enhanced by their independent reading.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students read chapter 16 of *Two Roads* and participated in a Language Dive to analyze the language variety used by Possum. In this lesson, students read the next chapter in their anchor text and repeat the Final Word protocol, introduced in Lesson 3, to continue analyzing the different means by which an author reveals a character’s point of view. Students also share what they have learned so far from their Independent Research Reading, launched in Lesson 3.

Support All Students

- In Chapter 17, Possum uses the word “hoboes” to describe Cal and Pop (180). Make sure students are aware that this term is outdated and now may be considered offensive. Invite them to think about what this term denoted at the time and consider alternatives, like “knights of the road,” which Cal himself also uses (180).

- The Final Word protocol gives students an opportunity to process their ideas silently before sharing them with a small group. Processing time is especially important for ELLs, who may need additional time to locate evidence in a text and formulate a response. ▲

- Also, by rotating which student speaks first in the Final Word protocol, students will have the opportunity to both present a novel idea and respond to a classmate’s idea. These roles require different linguistic strategies, providing good practice for ELLs. Consider providing sentence frames to support ELLs in both roles (e.g., What I thought about was\_\_\_\_\_\_; I agree with your statement that \_\_\_\_\_). ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson reuses the Final Word protocol from Lesson 3. This protocol is especially beneficial for ELLs—the collaboration built into the protocol allows students to benefit from the knowledge of other members of their groups. During the protocol, students work together to answer questions, such as “How do you think Cal is feeling as the ‘new guy’ at Challagi?” For some ELLs, this question may be resonant, and sharing their thoughts aloud in an environment that is neither threatening nor evaluative may feel especially affirming.

- ELLs may find it challenging to adequately synthesize their learning across the unit before the end of unit assessment. Create space for students to reflect on the skills and strategies they have practiced during Unit 1. It may be useful to display the language of some of the key focus standards assessed during the end of unit assessment (e.g., RL.6.3, RL.6.6, L.6.1b, L.6.1e) and invite students to identify and celebrate their work toward those standards.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.2, 6.I.A.3, 6.I.A.4, 6.II.A.1, and 6.II.C.6.

Assessment Guidance

- This is the final lesson before the End of Unit 1 Assessment. Review the entrance ticket to ensure that students understand how a sentence or paragraph functions in the text as a whole. Review students’ Analyze Point of View: *Two Roads* note-catcher to ensure students understand the different methods authors use to develop a character’s point of view.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will complete the End of Unit 1 Assessment, which requires students to read a new excerpt of *Two Roads* and analyze the development of Cal’s point of view, the structure of the text, the use of intensive pronouns, and the impact of the use of language varieties on character development in the text.

- Students will revisit the entrance ticket in this lesson during an activity in Unit 2, Lesson 1. Collect their entrance tickets for safekeeping or instruct students to put them away in a safe place.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RL.6.2 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 14**. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 14 (example for teacher reference)** for possible responses. Invite students to use the **Determine Themes: *The Lightning Thief*** **Theme anchor chart** to help them as they complete their entrance ticket.

- Invite students to share responses to the entrance ticket. Explain that they will revisit these later in this lesson and in Unit 2, Lesson 1, and will need to save them in a safe spot.

- Using a preferred classroom routine, collect or review the answers to **Homework: Analyze Structure and Point of View: *Two Roads***, **Chapter 16**. Refer to **Homework: Analyze Structure and Point of View: *Two Roads***, **Chapter 16 (answers for teacher reference).**

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar to or the same as previous lessons. Invite students to choose a habit of character focus for themselves for this lesson.

Work Time

A. Read *Two Roads*, Chapter 17 – RL.6.5 (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Read chapter 17 of the text, using **Text Guide: *Two Roads*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students who are ready to read independently or in small groups should be released to this independence. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Students continue to identify how characters in the text demonstrate habits of character. Refer to the **Gist anchor chart: *Two Roads*** **(example for teacher reference)** and **chapter synopsis** as needed, as well as any other appropriate resources.

- Gist: Cal is assigned a bed. He returns to Pop to say goodbye.

- Ask:

“How does this chapter seem to be functioning within the overall structure of the novel? How does it help to develop the plot of *Two Roads*?” (This chapter acts as a turning point. It ends Cal’s time with his father as this is the moment he and his father say goodbye, and it begins Cal’s time at the school. The plot of the earlier chapters builds to this pivotal moment, one that is necessary before Cal can begin his own journey and his father his.)

“How does this chapter help to develop a possible theme of *Two Roads*?” (Cal is coming to the realization that he will not be with Pop anymore, and he will have to stand on his own as he also comes to understand his own history and works to figure out how this new identity fits into the one he has known previously. This seems to convey the theme that challenges and adversity can help us uncover a greater understanding of ourselves and our identities. “For the first time in my life I feel awkward around my father. I do not know what to say or do. The two of us stand side by side, looking out over the broad lawn that stretches in front of the big imposing buildings of the school.”)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

B. Analyze Point of View: Cal – RL.6.6 (10 minutes)

- Move students into groups of four. Remind students of the process for the Final Word protocol. Explain that each member of the group will take a turn answering a question as the rest of the group listens. When all members of the group have answered, the person who answered first gets the final word and will explain how their thinking changed or evolved after hearing the responses of their peers.

- Ask:

“What is Cal’s point of view about being at Challagi? What, in the text, makes you think so?” (Answers will vary, but may include: increasingly optimistic. He is starting to see Possum as a friend.)

- Allow time for students to discuss the prompt using the Final Word protocol. Encourage students to use their anchor text to find specific evidence from chapters 16 or 17 to support their response.

- Refocus students and invite them to pick a new group member to start the next round of Final Word.

- Ask:

“How does the author show the reader how Cal is feeling? Give examples from the text to explain your thinking.” (Answers will vary, but may include: allusion. Cal references Robinson Crusoe, the story of a sailor left shipwrecked on an island of cannibals but saved with the help of his friend, Friday. Cal sees Challagi as the island and Possum as Friday.)

- Allow time for students to discuss the new prompt.

- Circulate and monitor, strategically using a combination of Conversation Cues to help students to elaborate on their thinking and co-construct understanding of the text and the author’s methods:

“Can you say more about that?” (Goal 2)

“What, in the (sentence/text), makes you think so?” (Goal 3)

“Do you agree or disagree with what your partner said? Why?” (Goal 4)

“Who can explain why your classmate came up with that response?” (Goal 4)

- Refocus students, and direct them to retrieve their **Analyze Point of View: *Two Roads*** **note-catcher**. Instruct students to fill in the row for chapter 17 using the examples discussed. Refer to **Analyze Point of View: *Two Roads*** **note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** as needed, although students may come up with correct responses other than the sample listed on the example.

For Lighter Support

- In preparation for the end of unit assessment, invite students to revisit the sentence frame from the Mini Language Dive of Lesson 4:

- Cal \_\_\_\_\_ (verb phrase) more \_\_\_\_\_ (adverb phrase) than \_\_\_\_\_ (other character).

- Encourage students who need lighter support to consider ways to manipulate this frame to focus on new characters or this frame can be used to answer a similar question on the assessment of the following lesson.

For Heavier Support

- In preparation for the end of unit assessment, invite students to revisit the sentence frame from the Mini Language Dive of Lesson 4:

- Cal \_\_\_\_\_ (verb phrase) more \_\_\_\_\_ (adverb phrase) than \_\_\_\_\_ (other character).

- Encourage students who need heavier support to practice using this frame to describe differences between Cal’s and Possum’s speech in chapter 17, which students read during Work Time A. This frame can be used to answer a similar question on the assessment of the following lesson.

Closing and Assessment

A. Share Independent Research Reading – RL.6.10, RI.6.10 (15 minutes)

- Refer to the **Independent Reading Sample Plans** to guide students through a research reading share, or use a different routine.

- Remind students that the purpose of research reading is to build their content knowledge, domain-specific vocabulary, and achievement on reading complex texts. As necessary, use the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart** to review *integrity*. Students demonstrate integrity by keeping up with their independent research reading even though it can be challenging.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their habit of character focus for this lesson.

For Lighter Support

- During the independent research reading share, strategically use combinations of Conversation Cues to challenge students who need lighter support to deepen their thinking and expand the conversation. For example:

- “Can you say more about that?” (Goal 1)

- “Can you figure out why \[the author presented the information in that way\]?” (Goal 3)

- “How is what \_\_\_ said the same as/different from what \_\_\_ said?” (Goal 4)

For Heavier Support

- During the independent research reading share, strategically use combinations of Conversation Cues to help students who need heavier support be understood and improve their metacognition. For example:

- “So do you mean \_\_\_?” (Goal 1)

- “What strategies have helped you succeed in your independent research reading?” (Goal 3)

- “I’ll give you time to think and write or sketch.” (Goal 1)

- During the independent research reading share, pair students who need heavier support. Invite them to select short passages from their independent research reading texts and read them aloud to their partners. This will allow students to practice their intonation using principles from the Mini Language Dive of Lesson 2 and begin to prepare them for the expectations of the performance task during Unit 3.

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
