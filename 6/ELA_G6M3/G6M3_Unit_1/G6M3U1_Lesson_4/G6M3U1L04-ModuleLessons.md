Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.6.2 – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they write one sentence that captures the central idea of the Captain Pratt speech excerpt, which they analyzed during the previous lesson.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time A: Students listen to Zitkala-Sa’s “The Land of Red Apples” read aloud and use evidence from the text to answer questions on the Analyze Point of View: “The Land of Red Apples” note-catchers.

- RI.6.2 – Work Time A: Students identify and describe key ideas in “The Land of Red Apples” on their note-catchers.

- RI.6.6 – Work Time A: Students begin to fill out their Analyze Point of View: “The Land of Red Apples” note-catchers, answering questions about Zitkala-Sa’s point of view, including how it is conveyed through specific words in the text.

- SL.6.1d – Work Time A: Students listen to “The Land of Red Apples” read aloud and review its key ideas.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time B: Students participate in a close read of “The Land of Red Apples” and use textual evidence to answer questions about the text. The Close Reading Guide lists the text excerpts, key questions to ask students, and instructional moves required. Continue to use discussion protocols (e.g., Think-Pair-Share, Conversation Cues, and total participation techniques) to engage all students in a collaborative discussion about the text.

- RI.6.4 – Work Time B: During the close read, students determine the meaning of words as they are used in the “The Land of Red Apples.”

- RI.6.6 – Work Time B: During the close read, students answer questions about the author’s point of view toward the people, places, and experiences that she describes in the text.

- L.6.4a – Work Time B: During the close read, students use context to answer questions about the meanings of unfamiliar words in the text.

- L.6.4c – Work Time B: During the close read, students use dictionaries to determine the precise meaning of unfamiliar words in the text.

- L.6.4d – Work Time B: During the close read, students use dictionaries to verify the preliminary meanings of unfamiliar words in the text.

- L.6.5a – Work Time B: During the close read, students examine the author’s use of figurative language in the text.

- L.6.5c – Work Time B: During the close read, students determine the connotation of words used by the author and explain how the connotations differ from those of words with similar denotations.

- RI.6.6 – Closing and Assessment A: Students return to their Analyze Point of View: “The Land of Red Apples” note-catchers to answer additional questions about the author’s point of view.

- Students focus on working to become ethical people by showing compassion and empathy as they listen to Zitkala-Sa’s experience and close read her text “The Land of Red Apples.” Students focus on working to become effective learners by collaborating as they work in pairs throughout the close read.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- An optional Mini Language Dive, intended for use after students first listen to “The Land of Red Apples” read aloud during Work Time A, is available in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Students who are genuinely moved by Zitkala-Sa’s piece may ask to read more about her American Indian boarding school experience; encourage them to read the full account of her experience, which is available online in its entirety. Students may also want to begin thinking about and freewrite journaling about how Zitkala-Sa’s experience informs the guiding questions; What kinds of experiences did students have at American Indian boarding schools? How did these experiences impact students?

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students read a supplemental text, a speech by Captain Pratt, to build background information on American Indian boarding schools. The learning around American Indian boarding schools continues in this lesson through the experience of Zitkala-Sa, a member of the Yankton tribe and a student at a boarding school. Examining the boarding schools from the perspectives of two different historical figures allows students to practice determining an author’s point of view and purpose, and explaining how it is conveyed in a text.

Support All Students

- Note that there is a differentiated version of the Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 4 used during Opening A. ▲

- “The Land of Red Apples” is the account of a young girl arriving at an American Indian boarding school for the first time. The narrative explores her feelings of fear and sadness as she is removed from her family and attempts to adjust to unfamiliar surroundings. A close read provides a space for students to engage deeply with the reading’s content and examine their own feelings about it.

- In “The Land of Red Apples,” the narrator refers to herself and other children as “bronzed” and calls the white administrators of the boarding school “palefaces.” These outdated descriptions may evoke a response from students. Encourage them to practice empathy, putting themselves in the mindset of the young narrator who lived many years ago and was attempting to make sense of the new people around her.

- The language of “The Land of Red Apples” is complex. It features academic vocabulary, many embedded clauses, and a style that is somewhat antiquated. A close read helps students understand the text’s ideas and provides opportunities to practice strategies for discerning the meaning of unknown words. To further support ELLs through the close read, consider providing students with the gist of the text ahead of time (*This text is about a girl who leaves her family to attend an American Indian boarding school*). Since central idea is not the focus of the close read, providing this information ahead of time supports students’ comprehension without disrupting their learning. ▲

- Students may need additional support with recording their answers on their note-catchers. Consider sitting those students in a group together for support when necessary.

- To support ELLs, this lesson includes a close read of a narrative nonfiction text, “The Land of Red Apples,” which details a young girl’s arrival at an American Indian boarding school. The language of the text is challenging; teaching notes in the lesson provide suggestions for supporting intermediate-level ELLs (e.g., by presenting the gist of the text to students before they read). A Mini Language Dive is also available to support students’ understanding of the author’s point of view.

- ELLs may find it challenging to interpret the complicated language of “The Land of Red Apples,” which may affect students’ abilities to generate a sophisticated understanding of the text. Assuage students’ concerns by pointing out that the purpose of the close read is not to examine central idea or write a summary, but rather to explore the narrator’s point of view, which is conveyed through multiple examples of thoughtful word choice and figurative language.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.B.5, 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.8, 6.II.A.1, and 6.II.A.2.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Analyze Point of View: “The Land of Red Apples” note-catcher and note students who may need additional practice in listening comprehension.

- Review students’ Close Read: “The Land of Red Apples” note-catchers to ensure students understand Zitkala-Sa’s point of view.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will read excerpts of the Meriam Report. Students will determine key ideas and analyze the author’s point of view. They will participate in a Jigsawprotocol which asks them to become experts of a specific excerpt and then share their knowledge with their peers.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.6.2 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 4** or the optional **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 4** ▲. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 4 (example for teacher reference)** for possible responses. Students will need their copies of **Captain Pratt speech excerpt** and **Analyze Point of View: Captain Pratt note-catcher**. Refer to **Analyze Point of View: Captain Pratt note-catcher (example for teacher reference)**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar to or the same as previous lessons. Invite students to choose a habit of character focus for themselves for this lesson.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- During Opening A, invite students who need heavier support to use the Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 4 ▲. This resource features a sentence frame and a word bank to support students as they write a summary statement of the informational text from the previous lesson.

Work Time

A. Analyze Point of View: “The Land of Red Apples” – SL.6.1d (15 minutes)

- Remind students that the anchor text is historical fiction. In this lesson and the next, students will continue to read supplemental informative texts to build background on this historical topic to better understand the novel.

- Distribute the **Analyze Point of View: “The Land of Red Apples” note-catcher**.

- Cold-call students to read the directions, column headings, and questions aloud. Clarify that students will listen to a chapter from Zitkala-Sa’s memoir. After the reading, students will record their responses in the middle column.

- Direct students’ attention to the **Point of View anchor chart**, specifically the notes related to informational texts. Inform students that the text they will be reading is a person’s recollection of events that happened to her; therefore, even though the text may read as a narrative, the text is informational.

- Read aloud **“The Land of Red Apples” by Zitkala-Sa**.

- Direct students to complete the Listen column of the note-catcher.

- Explain that they will complete the Read column later in the lesson.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time A, after students first listen to “The Land of Red Apples” read aloud, invite students to participate in a Mini Language Dive in small groups to analyze the way in which the author uses a compelling comparative structure to illustrate her point of view in the text (RI.6.6, L.6.3a). This Mini Language Dive also gives students the opportunity to examine the connotation of a key verb in the sentence (*trembled*) (L.6.5c).

For Heavier Support

N/A

Work Time

B. Close Read: “The Land of Red Apples” – RI.6.6, L.6.5 (20 minutes)

- Focus students on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart** and remind them that digging into the text deeper can help them understand it better.

- Move students into predetermined pairs. Distribute “The Land of Red Apples” by Zitkala-Sa.

- Use **Close Reading Guide: “The Land of Red Apples”** to set the purpose of the close read and to guide students through a close read of this excerpt. Refer to the guide for how to integrate the following:

- **Close Read: “The Land of Red Apples” note-catcher**

- **Print or online dictionary**

- Refer to **Close Read: “The Land of Red Apples” note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- If time allows, use a Jigsaw protocol to acquaint students with the text before beginning the close read in Work Time B. Students can work in small groups to become “experts” on smaller selections of text, and then report findings back to the larger group. By the time students read the text during the close read, they will have already encountered key passages, reducing the cognitive challenge of interpreting entirely new text.

Closing and Assessment

A. Analyze Point of View: “The Land of Red Apples” – RI.6.6 (5 minutes)

- Refocus students on Analyze Point of View: “The Land of Red Apples” note-catcher. Ask students to complete the Read column of the note-catcher.

- Collect the note-catcher as students leave the class.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their habit of character focus for this lesson.

Homework

A. Analyze Language and Point of View

- Students complete **Homework: Analyze Language and Point of View: “Iron Routine.”**
