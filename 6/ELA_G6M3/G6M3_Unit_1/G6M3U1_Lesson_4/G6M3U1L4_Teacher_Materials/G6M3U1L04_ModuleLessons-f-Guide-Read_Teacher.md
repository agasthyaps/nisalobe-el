(For Teacher Reference)

**Purpose and Notes**

- The purpose of this close read is for students to analyze the text for how it shows the point of view of Zitkala-Sa, the narrator, as a young child when she first leaves home to go to the American Indian boarding school.

- The students have already listened to the text read aloud. This lesson provides a second reading as a read aloud in class.

- Reread these pages aloud, and prompt students to follow along silently. From time to time, have students reread portions of the text in order to answer text-dependent questions.

- Students work in pairs for this close read.

- A note-catcher, along with text dependent questions, provides an opportunity for students to respond to the questions posed during the Close Read.

- Continue to use discussion protocols (e.g., Turn and Talk, Cold Call, and total participation techniques) to engage all students in collaborative discussion about the text

<li><p>Read the text aloud as students read along silently.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “What do you think the word <strong>scrutinized</strong> means?” (looked closely; inspected)</p></li>
<li><p>If students seem uncertain about the word, show them how to use the sentences around it to figure out what it means. For example, the men and women on the train are both stopping, and the men “riveted their glassy blue eyes” on them—so <strong>scrutinized</strong> may have something to do with looking at them or staring at them.</p></li>
<li><p>Say: “Let’s check that in a dictionary and see if we were right.”</p></li>
<li><p>Students check the word in a dictionary. If using a print dictionary, be sure to explain that words are listed in alphabetical order.</p></li>
<li><p>Direct students to record this definition on their note-catcher.</p></li>
<li><p>Working in partners, direct students to discuss, and then record in their note-catchers, their responses to these questions:</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “So now that we know that ‘scrutinized’ means ‘staring,’ how are the connotations between those two words different?” (Scrutinized has a more negative connotation than staring; it implies the looking is critical and judgmental in nature, not just observing or watching in an approving or neutral fashion.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “How does Zitkala-Sa’s use of <strong>scrutinized</strong> help to convey her point of view toward her experience on the train?” (The use of this word suggests that Zitkala-Sa understands that she is being judged in a disapproving fashion by the white people on the train, and she feels very different from those people.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “What other words in the paragraph have connotations that also convey that point of view?” (“<strong>stopped</strong>,” “<strong>halted</strong>,” and “<strong>riveted</strong>”)</p></li>

<li><p>Read the text aloud as students read along silently.</p></li>
<li><p>Working in partners, direct students to discuss, and then record in their note-catchers, their responses to this question: “At the start of the paragraph, she says she ‘sank deep into the corner of my seat.’ Another way she could have said this is ‘I sat down in my seat.’ How are the connotations between those two versions different and how does the connotation of the way she chose to write it help to convey her point of view?” (“<strong>Sank deep</strong>” and “<strong>corner</strong>” imply that she is trying to be small and unnoticed because she feels judged by the white people because she is different from them. If she had just said she sat down, it wouldn’t help to convey exactly how she was feeling at this moment.)</p></li>
<li><p>Use a total participation technique to ask: “What other evidence do we see in this paragraph of Zitkala-Sa’s point of view that she feels judged by and very different from the white people on the train?” (The white children point at her feet, their mothers point out the blanket she is wearing; she tells us she is embarrassed and almost crying.)</p></li>

<li><p>Ask: “What does this sentence convey about how Zitkala-Sa was feeling at this moment?” (This sentence makes clear how different her current experience is from her previous life. Before she saw the poles outside her mother’s yard, and now she’s watching each one pass her as she moves far away from that old life.)</p></li>

The adults at the school misunderstood the cause of her tears and gave her food; she pleads to go home but the “ears of the palefaces could not hear me.”)</p></li>
