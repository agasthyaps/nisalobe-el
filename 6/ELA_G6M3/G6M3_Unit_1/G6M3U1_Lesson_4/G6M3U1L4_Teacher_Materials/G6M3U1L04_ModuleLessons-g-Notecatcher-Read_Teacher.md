(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Answer the questions with your partner as your teacher reads specific paragraphs in “The Land of Red Apples.”

**Paragraphs 1 and 2**

1.  What is the narrator’s point of view toward the journey she and the seven other Yankton children are about to take? How do you know?

She is looking forward to it. She writes that she is “impatient to start,” “dreamt of roaming as freely,” and “anticipated much pleasure.”

**Paragraph 3**

2.  Definition of scrutinized:

looked closely; inspected

3.  How do the connotations of **scrutinized** and **staring** differ?

Scrutinized has a more negative connotation than staring; it implies the looking is critical and judgmental in nature, not just observing or watching in an approving or neutral fashion.

4.  How does Zitkala-Sa’s use of **scrutinized** help to convey her point of view toward her experience on the train?

The use of this word suggests that Zitkala-Sa understands that she is being judged in a disapproving fashion by the white people on the train, and she feels very different from those people.

5.  What other words in the paragraph have connotations that also convey that point of view?

stopped, halted, and riveted

**  
Paragraph 4**

6.  At the start of the paragraph, she says she “sank deep into the corner of my seat.” Another way she could have said this is ‘I sat down in my seat.’ How are the connotations between those two versions different? How does the connotation of the way she chose to write it help to convey her point her point of view?

“Sank deep” and “corner” imply that she is trying to be small and unnoticed because she feels judged by the white people because she is different from them. If she had just said she “sat down,” it wouldn’t convey as clearly how she was feeling at this moment.

**Paragraph 6**

7.  How does Zitkala-Sa’s choice to include this detail about the missionaries handing out candy impact the reader’s understanding of the text?

To show how very different the points of view toward the school were—the missionaries who thought they were doing something good, and the children who were entering a foreign and frightening culture.

**Paragraphs 7 and 8**

8.  Why are the words **excited** and **trembled more from fear** important in this section? How do they help the reader see the difference in point of view toward the school between the white people at the school and Zitkala-Sa?

The school staff are pleased that the American Indian children have arrived; in contrast, Zitkala-Sa is very frightened by this strange new world.

**Paragraphs 9 and 10**

9.  What does this phrase **increasing enthusiasm** show the reader about the woman’s point of view toward this moment?

She seems to be energetically welcoming Zitkala-Sa, not realizing how it is affecting Zitkala-Sa.

**Paragraphs 11 and 12**

10. What do each of the phrases **very little I could swallow besides my sobs** and **the ears of the palefaces could not hear** mean within the context of the text?

The first means she was so upset that she was unable to eat and could only cry instead; the second means that the adults at the school neither understood nor seemed to care that Zitkala-Sa was upset.

11. How does Zitkala-Sa’s use of figurative language in these two short paragraphs help to convey a key idea of the text?

They highlight the difference in point of view between Zitkala-Sa and the white people toward the school and the disconnect between how each experiences the events. “The adults at the school misunderstood the cause of my tears,” gave her food; she pleads to go home but the “ears of the palefaces do not hear me.”

**Culminating Task**

12. Reread the last sentence of the excerpt: “My tears were left to dry themselves in streaks, because neither my aunt nor my mother was near to wipe them away.”

How does this sentence capture the central idea of Zitkala-Sa’s point of view toward her new life at the school?

Her point of view is that she is entering a strange and frightening world and that she is isolated and alone in it.
