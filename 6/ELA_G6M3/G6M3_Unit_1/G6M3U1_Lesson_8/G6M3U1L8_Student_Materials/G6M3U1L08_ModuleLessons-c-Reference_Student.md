**Chapter 9, “Upside Down”**

- Cal and Pop hop a train to take them further west, to Challagi.

- Cal asks about his heritage. Pop informs Cal that he is half Indian because his mother was Armenian and Pop is Creek.

- Cal asks about Challagi. Pop does not hold any information back from Cal. Pop confides to Cal that a main reason kids ran away from Challagi, including himself, was because of the severe discipline. Some Indian children were even killed at Indian schools.

- After the Meriam Report, Pop assumes the treatment of Indian children has improved.

- Cal worries about how he will fit in with the other Indian students.

- Cal does not say much but Pop gives words to Cal’s fears: Cal is fearful that he will not fit in because he has been raised to see himself as white and he doesn’t “speak Indian.”

- Pop explains that there will be Indian kids at Challagi who “don’t know much Indian at all.” Pop continues to explain that there is not just one Indian language because there is a language for every tribe, so students do not necessarily know each other’s languages.

- Pop shares that he made great friends while at Challagi.

- Pop encourages Cal by stating, “I’ve never known anyone to be a faster learner than you, Cal.” Pop is sure that Cal will learn well and learn quickly at Challagi.

- Pop informs Cal that kids at Challagi who look white have a hard time. The students get bullied because their skin is so light. Pop tells Cal that he will have an easier time because his skin is darker.

- After the conversation, Cal feels as though “my world is upside down now for sure.”
