Why would Pop deliberately send Cal to an American Indian boarding school? How does his point of view toward the school explain his decision?

Answers will vary but may include: Many students were taken from their homes by force, but Pop is deliberately sending Cal to Challagi because he believes the school has changed. Pop’s point of view toward Challagi boarding school is surprisingly positive. Even though the conditions were harsh when he attended, the students found ways to make it bearable. He believes that the experience will be better for Cal. Pop learned a lot about his Creek identity while at school. He learned to speak Creek and how to do stomp dances. Pop made good friends while he was at Challagi, some of the best he’s ever had. He sends Cal to Challagi hoping Cal will have some of the positive experiences that he had.
