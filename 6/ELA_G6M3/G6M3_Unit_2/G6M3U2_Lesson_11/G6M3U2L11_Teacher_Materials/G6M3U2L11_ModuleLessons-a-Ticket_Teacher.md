(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, read the learning targets. Then, complete the tasks below.

Revise the paragraph below to improve meaning and sentence variety by combining shorter simple sentences and using conjunctions to show how two sentences are related.

The Washington police marched towards us. We thought they were there to honor the Bonus Army. We thought they came to thank us for our military service. We thought they came with an agreement from President Hoover to honor our requests for our bonus payment. People came out of buildings to witness this event. They lined the streets and cheered. The police charged. The police started shooting. Soldiers threw tear gas into the crowd. We started to retreat. Our campsite was set on fire.

Sample student response: The Washington police marched towards us in uniform rows. It seemed they had come in peace, to honor the Bonus Army, thank us for our military service, and bring an agreement from President Hoover granting our request for our bonus payment. All around us, people poured out of buildings, lining the streets and cheering! Suddenly, the police charged us. Shots were fired. Soldiers hurled tear gas into the crowd. We retreated in fear while our campsites went up in flames behind us.

Explain the changes you made and how they improve the variety and meaning of the paragraph.

Sample student response: One change I made was to combine sentences 2, 3, and 4.  
This change improved the variety of the paragraph by removing redundancies and changing up sentences that all had the same beginning. I also added descriptive language (poured, hurled) to make the scene more intense and easier to visualize. I used ‘suddenly’ as a transition to show how the scene changed.
