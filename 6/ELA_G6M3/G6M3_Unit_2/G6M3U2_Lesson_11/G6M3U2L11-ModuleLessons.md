American Indian Boarding Schools

Grade 6: Module 3: Unit 2: Lesson 11

Lesson Overview

Lesson Summary

Students continue practicing correct pronoun use, specifically in creating agreement of number and person between pronouns and their antecedents. Students then use their Point of View and Character note-catchers to gather evidence for why Cal should return to Challagi at the end of the novel and for why Cal should stay with Pop instead.

Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- L.6.3a – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they revise a paragraph to improve meaning and sentence variety.

- L.6.1c – Work Time A: Students participate in a mini lesson to learn more about pronoun person and number.

- W.6.1b – Work Time B: Students begin to fill out their Independent Argument Evidence note-catchers. They gather reasons and evidence to support an argument that Cal should return to Challagi Indian Industrial School.

- W.6.9a – Work Time B: Students apply Grade 6 Reading standards to literature by planning narrative letters that illustrate the way that Cal has changed across *Two Roads*.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- At Grade 7, the L.3 standard requires students to choose precise language that eliminates wordiness and redundancy. Build on the work during Opening A of this lesson by asking students to compose a description of the same scene that uses more concise language. Additionally, invite students to find a passage of the text that effectively uses brief but powerful sentences to add meaning to the plot.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students finished reading *Two Roads* and capturing information on their Point of View and Character note-catchers. In this lesson, students use that work to direct them as they start to gather evidence that will be incorporated into a narrative letter from Cal to Possum. This work will also help them prepare for the argument essay writing that happens in Unit 3. They have also previously had instruction about pronoun case and sentence variety. This lesson continues and expands that instruction.

Support All Students

- Note that there is a differentiated version of the Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 11 used in Opening A in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- The pronoun mini lesson in this lesson is focused on person and number, and the materials maintain the more conventional usage of “they” as a third-person, plural pronoun. Please be aware, and consider alerting students, that the usage of *they* has shifted in current practice, and it is acceptable to use as a gender-neutral third person, singular pronoun. This note provides an excellent entry point for a discussion about the evolving nature of language and its power to convey subtle, nuanced messages about the writer’s point of view or values.

- During Work Time B, some students, including ELLs, may find it challenging to complete their Independent Argument Evidence note-catchers. As needed, allow students to use sticky notes in their books to mark evidence, rather than writing quotations in the Evidence sections of their note-catchers. Encourage students to focus their energy developing the Elaboration and Reason sections. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson continues to develop students’ understanding of pronouns through a mini lesson that focuses on pronoun person and number. Turn and Talk and Think-Pair-Share protocols are embedded within the mini lesson to ensure that students have opportunities to process their ideas privately and with classmates before being expected to contribute to the larger class discussion. In the second half of the lesson, students begin to gather evidence for the narrative letters that they will compose in the following lesson and revise in the end of unit assessment. Students use a detailed note-catcher to capture evidence for both possible positions that they could address in their letters: Cal *should* return to Challagi Indian Industrial School and Cal *shouldn’t* return. Although considering both sides of an argument is good practice for any writer, this process may be especially helpful for ELLs, as it clarifies overall writing purpose.

- ELLs may find it challenging to complete the Independent Argument Evidence note-catcher in the limited time available. Remind students that they are not being assessed on the letter that they write in the next lesson—although they will be assessed on its revisions. Help students prioritize fleshing out the Reason column based on the evidence they select. Remind students that the Elaboration portion of the note-catcher is meant to front their thinking and save them time when the write the letter.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.B.6, 6.I.C.11, 6.I.C.12, 6.II.A.1, 6.II.A.2, 6.II.B.4, and 6.II.C.6.

Assessment Guidance

- The pronoun instruction completed in this lesson assumes that students have some knowledge of subjects and predicates in sentences. Review these concepts, as necessary, to ensure clarity while students work to understand the continued pronoun work in Work Time A.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students study a model of a narrative letter from Cal to Possum about why he is not returning to Challagi and instead is staying with Pop. They then write their own narrative letter from Cal to Possum that explains why he is returning to Challagi.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.6.3a (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 11** or the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 11** ▲. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 11 (example for teacher reference)** for possible responses. Direct students to refer to the **Sentence Variety anchor chart** as needed.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar to or the same as previous lessons. Invite students to choose a habit of character focus for themselves for this lesson.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- During Opening A, invite students who need heavier support to use the Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 11 ▲. This resource features sentence frames that students can use to guide their answers to question 2.

Work Time

A. Mini Lesson: Pronoun Person and Number – L.6.1c (15 minutes)

- Distribute and display **Pronoun Person and Number notes**. Invite students to spend 3 minutes reading over the notes.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What wonderings do you have based on the notes?”

- Use **equity sticks** to call on three students to share one of their partner’s wonderings.

- Write student wonderings on a piece of **chart paper** that serves as a Parking Lot for questions.

- Explain to students that there are three pronoun person categories: first, second, and third. Each case has specific pronouns for both singular and plural antecedent. In order to figure out if a pronoun is used correctly based on its person and number, students must learn to identify the person and number that corresponds to a pronoun’s antecedent (the word that is being replaced by the pronoun).

- Direct students’ focus to the chart located in the Pronoun Person and Number notes.

- Turn and Talk:

“What is familiar about this chart? What is unfamiliar?”

- Direct students’ focus to the first example located in the Pronoun Person and Number notes.

- Cold-call a student to read the sentence. Ask:

“What is the case of the missing pronoun?” (possessive)

“What is the antecedent of the missing pronoun?” (*Gale*)

“What is the person and number of the antecedent?” (third, singular)

“What is the correct pronoun to use in this sentence?” (*her*)

- Direct students’ focus to the second example located in the Pronoun Person and Number notes.

- Cold-call a student to read the sentence. Ask:

“What is the case of the missing pronoun?” (subjective)

“What is the antecedent of the missing pronoun?” (*Cal*)

“What is the person and number of the antecedent?” (first, singular)

“What is the correct pronoun to use in this sentence?” (*I*)

- Direct students’ focus to the third example located in the Pronoun Person and Number notes.

- Cold-call a student to read the sentence. Ask:

“What is the case of the missing pronoun?” (objective)

“What is the antecedent of the missing pronoun?” (*kids at my old school*)

“What is the person and number of the antecedent?” (third, plural)

“What is the correct pronoun to use in this sentence?” (*them*)

- Return to the Parking Lot questions and address any questions that were not answered through the mini lesson instruction.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“Why might it be important or useful to understand pronouns and the person and number of their antecedent?” (Answers will vary, but may include: Using the correct pronoun that corresponds to the antecedent’s person and number, and of course, case, means the pronoun will be more clear for a reader, or there will be less chance of an unclear reference. This means the sentence will be more clear for a reader as well.)

- Explain that the homework provides them with additional practice with pronoun case, person, and number.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

B. Gather Evidence: Cal Returns to School – W.6.1b, W.6.9a (20 minutes)

- Remind students of the narrative letter writing task that was introduced in the previous lesson.

- Distribute and display the **Independent Argument Evidence note-catcher**.

- Explain that this note catcher will also be used to help them collect and analyze evidence for their argument essay in Unit 3, and they’ll spend more time learning about the term “claim,” which is a key term in argument writing.

- Ask:

“What is meant by ‘reasons’ in the context of this note-catcher?” (“Reasons” refers to the reasons why Cal should or should not return to school.)

“What is meant by ‘evidence’ in the context of this note-catcher?” (“Evidence” is the textual evidence from Two Roads that supports each reason.)

- Turn and Talk:

“How do ‘reasons’ differ from ‘reasoning’?” (“Reasoning” is the elaboration that explains how the evidence supports the reason.)

- Remind students that they are familiar with evidence and elaboration from previous writing instruction in Modules 1 and 2.

- Focus students on just one side of the note-catcher: Position 1: Cal should return to Challagi Indian Industrial School.

- Invite students to offer reasons to support this position. Gather their reasons on chart paper in a highly visible location. After several reasons have been offered, divide students into triads.

- Explain that triads will pick one of the reasons offered by the class to support Position 1 and complete the Reason, Evidence, and Reasoning boxes on the note-catcher for their chosen Reason. Remind students to reference their **Analyze Character** and **Analyze Point of View note-catchers** for assistance.

- Circulate and monitor as students fill in the evidence and reasoning for just one reason.

- Refocus students and call one triad to share their responses. Model the completion of the first row (reason, evidence, explanation) with student assistance in providing the content. Clarify any questions students might have.

- Direct students to continue filling in their note-catcher for Position 1, gathering reasons and evidence for why Cal should return to school rather than stay with Pop and elaborating by explaining their reasoning in the note-catcher. As students work, circulate to push their thinking, provide support, and answer questions. Refer to the **Independent Argument Evidence note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** as needed.

Closing and Assessment

A. Determine Reasons: Cal Stays with Pop – SL.6.1 (5 minutes)

- Focus students on just the other side of the note-catcher: Position 2: Cal should NOT return to Challagi Indian Industrial School.

- Invite students to offer reasons to support this position. Gather their reasons on chart paper in a highly visible location and direct students to add these reasons to their Independent Argument Evidence note-catcher. After several reasons have been offered, pause and explain that students will complete the Evidence and Reasoning sections for Position 2 as their homework.

- Students should leave the final part of the note catcher blank (“Now that I’ve thought about it, my claim is \_\_\_\_\_”). They will be completing this portion during Unit 3 when they plan their argument essays.

- Field any new questions. Clarify that, in the next lesson, they will analyze a model letter and then write a letter to Possum from Cal. Remind them they will also use this evidence to help them write an argument in the next unit.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their habit of character focus for this lesson.

Homework

A. Practice Pronoun Case, Person, and Number

- Students complete **Homework: Practice Pronouns: *Two Roads***.

B. Gather and Analyze Evidence

- Students finish gathering and analyzing evidence for Position 2 on their Independent Argument Evidence note-catcher.
