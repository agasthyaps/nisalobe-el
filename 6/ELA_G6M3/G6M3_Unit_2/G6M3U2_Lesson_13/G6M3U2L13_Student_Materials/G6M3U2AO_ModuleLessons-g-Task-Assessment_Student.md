End of Unit 2 Assessment: Revise Narrative Writing for Pronoun Use and Sentence Variety

**Name:** **Date:**

**Directions:** Retrieve and reread the narrative letter you wrote to Possum from Cal explaining why Cal has decided to return to school. Revise this letter for (a) accurate pronoun use and (b) appropriate sentence pattern variety.

Manage your time carefully so that you can do the following:

1.  Revise your narrative, clearly marking your revisions with a colored pencil.

- Make sure that all pronouns are in the proper case (subjective, objective, possessive).

- Find and correct any inappropriate shifts in pronoun number and person.

- Find and fix any unclear or vague pronouns.

- Combine or revise some of your sentences to better convey meaning, maintain reader’s interest, and increase sentence pattern variety.

2.  Choose three pronouns that you used originally or revised if they needed to be corrected. Circle them on your letter, and then complete the table to explain why that pronoun is unambiguous and correct in terms of case, number, person.

| Pronoun | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
|         |             |
|         |             |
|         |             |

3.  Choose one revision you made to your sentences. Draw a box around that revision, and then explain below why that revision improved the sentence variety and meaning.
