Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Work Time A: Students complete the End of Unit 2 Assessment. They revise and explain their pronoun use in the narrative letter they wrote in the previous lesson, as well as make revisions to improve sentence variety and meaning. There is also an alternative assessment that uses a sample letter and that can be used with or without the revision as needed. (W.6.5 option 1 only, L.6.1a, L.6.1c, L.6.1d, L.6.3a)

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners by reading and answering questions independently for the end of unit assessment. Prompt students’ perseverance by reminding them that assessments are meant to inform instruction. Use assessment data to make choices about what should be retaught and how to adjust the pacing. Encourage students not to be afraid of mistakes; an accurate assessment is crucial for tailoring lessons to students’ needs.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Some students may not need extensive review of the assessment directions. Release them to begin working on the assessment while clarification is provided to other students who need more support.

- Proficient writers may finish early or determine that they have not used any pronouns incorrectly. Challenge these students to go back to make other revisions, such as adding more textual evidence, additional reasons to support their claim, or clearer transitions. Students may also continue practicing with the recording tool they will use for the End of Unit 3 assessment.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the second half of this unit, students finished *Two Roads* and collected evidence to write the narrative letter from Cal to Possum. Students also continued to engage in instruction about pronouns and sentence variety. This lesson continues those routines in an assessment, asking students to apply their learning to their own revisions or revisions on a sample letter.

Support All Students

- Independently completing writing tasks during assessments can be challenging for slower writers. By contrast, this end of unit assessment requires that students use class time to edit and revise a piece they have already written. This assessment gives students time to consider their writing at the word- and sentence-level, which is especially critical for ELLs. ▲

- Encourage students who might benefit from additional visual support to color-code the revisions they make to their narratives.

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study, as well as the goals of the assessment.

- For some students, this assessment may require more than the 30 minutes allotted. Consider providing time over multiple days if necessary.

- To support ELLs, this lesson invites students to complete assessment tasks similar to the classroom tasks in Lessons 8–12. Students will return to the narrative letters that they wrote in the previous lesson and revise them to ensure that all pronouns are used correctly—that is, that all pronouns are in the proper case, with no inappropriate shifts in pronoun number and no vague antecedents. Students are also asked to combine or revise some of their sentences to better convey meaning or the reader’s interest. This assessment supports ELLs by highlighting the importance of the revision process and reinforcing the idea that effective writing develops incrementally, perhaps relieving the pressure felt to produce “perfect” papers on the first try. Also, this lesson provides an alternative assessment, which features a sample essay and selected response questions about pronoun use. These assessments can be strategically assigned—one, the other, or both—to ELLs based on their assessment needs.

- ELLs may find it challenging to independently complete the end of unit assessment(s) without scaffolding. Point out that the end of unit assessment is similar to the activities they have successfully completed in class. Encourage students to do their best, and assure them that they will continue learning together after the assessment.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.II.A.1, 6.II.A.2, 6.II.B.5, 6.II.C.6, and 6.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- All assessment materials (student and teacher versions of Revise Narrative Writing for Pronoun Use and Sentence Variety) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- Though it is limited in scope, the narrative-revision assessment will provide enough evidence of student data to plan additional instructional support and later assessment for students who need more. Another option has been provided: End of Unit 2 Assessment: Selected Response Questions: Pronoun Use and Sentence Variety. This optional assessment uses passages from *Two Roads* with which students answer selected response questions about correct pronoun use and constructed response questions about sentence variety. Use this optional assessment instead of or in addition to the narrative-revision assessment to provide more data about student progress toward the standards. This decision can be made for the whole class or for individual students as appropriate, and the two versions can also be given at the same time or at different times as warranted by student needs.

- Since this assessment is focused solely on language standards, which are not priority standards that are tracked, students do not track progress as they normally do during assessment lessons. Students will record the narrative letter writing on the Writing Record and reflect on their experience of the assessment in the closing instead.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will begin work on the literary argument essay by analyzing a model. The work they complete leading to the narrative letter writing is additional preparation, specifically evidence collection, for the argument essay.

- Students’ End of Unit 2 Assessments will be returned in Unit 3, Lesson 8 with feedback.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare Revise Narrative Writing for Pronoun Use and Sentence Variety.

- Gather colored pencils for students to use as they track their revisions to their letters.

- Ensure feedback from the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment is ready for Opening A.

- Review the student tasks and example answers to get familiar with what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Prepare copies of handouts for students (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous modules to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 13**. Students will also need their **Module 3, Mid-Unit 2 Assessment with feedback**.

- Once all students are ready, invite them to share their “stars” and “steps” with a partner. Remind students that everyone is working toward individual goals and that learning is about continued growth and development.

- Using a preferred classroom routine, collect or review the answers to **Homework: Practice Pronouns and Sentence Variety: *Two Roads***. Refer to **Homework: Practice Pronouns and Sentence Variety: *Two Roads*** **(answers for teacher reference)**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar to or the same as previous lessons. Invite students to choose a habit of character focus for themselves for this lesson.

Work Time

A. Revise Narrative Writing for Pronoun Use and Sentence Variety (30 minutes)

- Distribute **End of Unit 2 Assessment: Revise Narrative Writing for Pronoun Use and Sentence Variety**, and invite students to retrieve their copies of the **narrative letter** they wrote in the previous lesson.

- Tell students that for this assessment, they will revise their letter to Possum for pronouns and sentence variety. Explain the purpose End of Unit 2 Assessment: Selected Response Questions: Pronoun Use and Sentence Variety as well, if it is being used. In both assessments, students revise and explain the correct use of pronouns and improve sentence variety to impact meaning.

- Invite students to follow along, reading silently in their heads, while the directions for each part of the assessment are read aloud. Make sure students understand the directions; paraphrase some instructions, if needed. ▲ Answer students’ questions, but refrain from supplying answers to the assessment questions themselves.

- Direct students’ attention to the following anchor charts:

- **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart**

- **Strategies to Answer Selected Response Questions anchor chart**

- Remind students to refer to these anchor charts as they read the assessment text and answer the assessment questions.

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence. Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart** and review what perseverance looks and sounds like. Remind students that because they will be reading and answering questions independently for the assessment, they may need to practice perseverance.

- Invite students to begin the assessment.

- While they are taking the assessment, circulate to monitor and document their test-taking skills.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- Before the assessment of Work Time A, underline key vocabulary in the assessment directions and prompt and read aloud together as a class to ensure that students understand each task included in the assessment. Invite students who need lighter support to restate or clarify information for students who need heavier support.

For Heavier Support

- Display a “map” of the assessment(s) to reference while explaining directions to the end of unit assessment. This will reduce ambiguity and give students a clearer picture of what they can expect so that they can better allocate their time and attentional resources. Provide students with colored pencils or highlighters so that they can mark up the map as needed. Example:

Pronoun Use and Sentence Variety in Narrative Writing

9.  Read your narrative.

10. Revise your narrative for pronoun case.

11. Correct inappropriate shifts in pronoun number and person.

12. Fix vague pronouns.

13. Improve sentence variety.

14. Choose three pronouns used correctly and explain why it is correct and unambiguous.
