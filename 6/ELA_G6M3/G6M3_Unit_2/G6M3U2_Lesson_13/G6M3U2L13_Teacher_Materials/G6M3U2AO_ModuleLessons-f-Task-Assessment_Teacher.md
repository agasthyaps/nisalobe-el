End of Unit 2 Assessment: Revise Narrative Writing for Pronoun Use and Sentence Variety

(Example for Teacher Reference)

Dear Possum,

This is **your** good friend, Cal, writing to **you**. I made it to Washington and found Pop. It took **me** four days of traveling, on train and on foot, to get here, but **I** made it. Pop was so happy to see **me**. **He** cried and hugged **me**, and **he** wasn’t mad at all that **I** left Challagi after promising that **I**’d stay. Like the squawking jaybird **I** am, I talked to Pop for a long time about Challagi. I told **him** about my classes and the plot of land I’m farming. I told **him** about my horse Dakota. **I** told **him** about Little Coon, Bear Meat, and Deacon, and how Deacon helped **me** understand the vision **I** had on the last night at Challagi, the one that brought **me** to Pop. Of course, **I** also told **him** about **you**. **He** remembers **you** from the first day, but **he**’s heard a lot more now. **He** knows that **you** are the best friend **I**’ve ever had.

The veterans’ campaign here in Washington isn’t over yet, but Pop’s acting different about it.  
A couple nights ago, he asked me, “What now, son?” When ~~they~~ **he** first went to Washington, Pop told me I had to go to Challagi. Now, it’s my choice what happens next: do I stay here with Pop or do I come back to Challagi? **I’ve been thinking about this a lot, and I think I know what I need to do. I need to come back to Challagi.**

When Pop first brought ~~myself~~ **me** to Challagi, I was so scared. I didn’t know anyone and I didn’t know how to be away from ~~him~~ **Pop**. So much has changed since then. Now I have a group of brothers, my Creek brothers. I have learned how to stomp dance and say some Creek phrases. I’m studying agricultural science and get to spend time with Dakota. **Sure, I don’t like Superintendent Morrell or all the marching we have to do, and I *really* don’t like getting punched in the ribs by Bear Meat, but I feel like I am growing so much every day. I can’t stop now.**

All of this is why I’ve decided to leave Pop for now and return to Challagi. I want to keep learning and keep building my friendships with you and the rest of the gang. It’s funny because when I first got to Challagi, all I wanted was to be with Pop. But something has changed in me since then. Maybe I’ve grown up, and I feel better about being independent. I even feel like I might want to start my own campaign against Challagi, in order to fight for all of us here. I can’t do that from far away.

Thank you for being such a good friend to me, Possum. **You’ve made Challagi a place I want to come home to. See you soon.**
