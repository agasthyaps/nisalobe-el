End of Unit 2 Assessment: Selected Response Questions: Pronoun Use and Sentence Variety

(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Read the following sample narrative letter to Possum from Cal. Answer the questions to correct the pronoun use and improve sentence variety. If the highlighted pronoun is already correct in the sentence, select the “no change” option.

Dear Possum,

This is **\[1\] your** good friend, Cal, writing to you. I made it to Washington and found Pop. It took me four days of traveling. I was on a train and walked to get here. I finally made it. Pop was so happy to see me. He cried and hugged me. He wasn’t mad at all that I left Challagi after promising that I’d stay. Like the squawking jaybird I am, I talked to Pop for a long time about Challagi. I told him about my classes and the plot of land I’m farming. I told him about my horse Dakota. I told him about Little Coon, Bear Meat, and Deacon, and how Deacon helped me understand the vision I had on the last night at Challagi, the one that brought me to Pop. Of course, I also told him about **\[2\] yourself**. He remembers you from the first day, but **\[3\] they’ve** heard a lot more now. He knows that you are the best friend I’ve ever had.

The veterans’ campaign here in Washington isn’t over yet, but Pop’s acting different about it. A couple nights ago, he asked me, “What now, son?” When he first went to Washington, Pop told me I had to go to Challagi. Now, it’s my choice what happens next: do I stay here with Pop or do I come back to Challagi? I’ve been thinking about this a lot, and I think I know what I need to do. I need to come back to Challagi.

When **\[4\] he** first brought **\[5\] me** to Challagi, I was so scared. I didn’t know anyone. I didn’t know how to be away from Pop. So much has changed since then. Now I have a group of brothers, my Creek brothers. I have learned how to stomp dance and say some Creek phrases. I’m studying agricultural science and get to spend time with Dakota. Sure, I don’t like Superintendent Morrell or all the marching we have to do. I *really* don’t like getting punched in the ribs by Bear Meat. But I feel like I am growing so much every day. I can’t stop now.

All of this is why I’ve decided to leave **\[6\] himself** for now and return to Challagi. I want to keep learning and keep building my friendships with you and the rest of the gang. It’s funny because when I first got to Challagi, all I wanted was to be with **\[7\] him**. But something has changed in me since then. Maybe I’ve grown up, and I feel better about being independent. I even feel like I might want to start my own campaign against Challagi, in order to fight for all of **\[8\] you** there. I can’t do that from far away.

Thank you for being such a good friend to me, Possum. You’ve made Challagi a place I want to come home to. See you soon.

Cal

1.  “Dear Possum, This is **your** good friend, Cal, writing to you.”

Which word best replaces **your**? (L.6.1a)

2.  <u>no change</u>

3.  you’re

4.  you

5.  yourself

Explain why the answer you chose is correct:

This was correct as is because “your” is the possessive case, and that’s what is needed in this context.

6.  “Like the squawking jaybird I am, I talked to Pop for a long time about Challagi. I told him about my classes and the plot of land I’m farming. I told him about my horse Dakota. I told him about Little Coon, Bear Meat, and Deacon, and how Deacon helped me understand the vision I had on the last night at Challagi, the one that brought me to Pop. Of course, I also told him about **yourself**.”

Which word best replaces **yourself**? (L.6.1a)

7.  no change

8.  your

9.  you’re

10. <u>you</u>

11. “He remembers you from the first day, but **they’ve** heard a lot more now.”

Which word best replaces **they’ve**? (L.6.1c)

12. no change

13. <u>he’s</u>

14. his

15. their

Explain why the answer you chose is correct:

I changed “they’ve” to “he’s” because this pronoun refers to Possum, so it needs to be singular. “They” is a plural pronoun, so it is not correct here.

16. “When **he** first brought me to Challagi, I was so scared. I didn’t know anyone. I didn’t know how to be away from Pop.”

Which word best replaces **he**? (L.6.1d)

17. no change

18. Superintendent Morrell

19. <u>Pop</u>

20. Cal

Explain why the answer you chose is correct:

I changed “he” to “Pop” because the antecedent is ambiguous, since this begins a new paragraph, and there is no mention of Pop in the sentence before the pronoun is used.

21. “When he first brought **me** to Challagi, I was so scared. I didn’t know anyone. I didn’t know how to be away from Pop.”

Which word best replaces **me**? (L.6.1a)

29. themselves

30. them

31. “I want to keep learning and keep building my friendships with you and the rest of the gang. It’s funny because when I first got to Challagi, all I wanted was to be with **him**.”

Which word best replaces **him**? (L.6.1d)

32. no change

33. Possum

34. Superintendent Morrell

35. <u>Pop</u>

36. “I even feel like I might want to start my own campaign against Challagi, in order to fight for all of **you** there.”

41. Revise the excerpt below to improve its sentence variety and meaning. Also explain why the changes you made help to better convey meaning.

“I made it to Washington and found Pop. It took me four days of traveling. I was on a train and walked to get here. I finally made it. Pop was so happy to see me. He cried and hugged me.”

Answers will vary, but may include: I made it to Washington and found Pop. It took me four days of traveling by train and walking to get here, but I finally made it. Pop was so happy to see me that he cried and hugged me. I combined sentences 2 and 3 because sentence 3 gave details about how he traveled. I also combined the last two sentences and used “that” to show the cause/effect relationship between the sentences.

42. Revise the excerpt below to improve its sentence variety and meaning. Also explain why the changes you made help to better convey meaning.

“I didn’t know anyone. I didn’t know how to be away from Pop. So much has changed since then. Now I have a group of brothers, my Creek brothers.”

Answers will vary, but may include: I didn’t know anyone, and I didn’t know how to be away from Pop, but so much has changed since then because now I have a group of brothers, my Creek brothers.

I combined all of the sentences. The first two go together because of the repetition of  
“I didn’t know,” and I used the conjunction “but” to show that a change was coming in the rest of the sentence, and I added the because to make clear the reason for the change.
