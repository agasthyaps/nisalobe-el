- Corporal Esom Dart asks Cal if he still has the France Victory Medal, and Cal affirms that the medal is still in his possession.

- Corporal Dart and Cal begin to make their way back to the camp where Cal will find Pop.

- Suddenly, armed military men on horses, infantrymen with guns, and tanks advance down the street toward the camp.

- The military attacks an encampment named Camp Glassford. Tear gas is thrown into the camp. Shelters and tents are set on fire by the soldiers.

- Corporal Dart and Cal make it to Camp Marks, which is across the river.

- Cal spots his father talking to policemen and the commander of Camp Marks.

- After the group of policemen and the camp commander move off to survey the camp, Pop and Cal reunite.

- Cal tells Pop everything, including the vision that prompted Cal to leave Challagi.

- Cal gives Pop the letters he has written. Pop reads each letter multiple times and vows to keep the letters for as long as he lives.

- The soldiers reach the other side of the bridge. Eddie Atwell, the camp commander, walks across the bridge with a white flag.

- Atwell returns and delivers the news that Camp Marks has an hour to evacuate.

- Pop and Cal begin walking to the hills behind the camp. They help people along the way.

- Pop and Cal hop a train in Maryland and head west.

- One day, as they are sitting around a fire, Pop asks Cal “What now, son?” Cal responds “Going back.”

- Pop and Cal are confident that Hoover will be voted out of office. With a new President, Pop and the other veterans will continue to try to persuade the government to give the vets their bonus checks.

- Cal knows that Pop will continue to fight for the means to have a place of their own again, so Cal recognizes that the right place for him to be is at Challagi with his Creek brothers.
