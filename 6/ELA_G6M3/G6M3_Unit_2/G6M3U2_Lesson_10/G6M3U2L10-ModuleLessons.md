Lesson Overview

Lesson Summary

Students finish reading the anchor text and participate in a text-based discussion of the novel’s conclusion. They also launch their next writing assignment—a narrative letter in which students will incorporate their learning about correct pronoun usage and sentence variety with their understanding of how the novel’s narrator, Cal, responds to challenges.

Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RL.6.6 – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they examine what Cal’s inner thoughts in an excerpt of chapter 29 reveal about his point of view.

- L.6.3a – Opening A: As part of the entrance ticket, students use different sentence variety strategies in their response.

- RL.6.1 – Closing and Assessment: Students participate in a text-based discussion, using evidence from the text to support their answers.

- RL.6.3 – Closing and Assessment: Students discuss questions about whether or not Cal should return to Challagi Indian Industrial School.

- SL.6.1a – Closing and Assessment: Students draw upon preparation to successfully participate in a text-based discussion. They refer to evidence from the text and reflect on ideas under discussion.

- SL.6.1b – Closing and Assessment: Students follow rules for a collegial discussion.

- SL.6.1c – Closing and Assessment: Students respond to questions with elaboration and detail, making comments that contribute to the issue under discussion.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- The text-based discussion in Closing and Assessment A is meant to prime students for writing the narrative letter by pushing them to begin formulating an argument supported by evidence and reasoning. However, another discussion option here that would allow students to make more personal connections to the text is one of the module guiding questions: What factors influence our identities? Challenge students to answer the question first with text-based evidence using prompting questions such as, “How does learning about the ways that Indians were treated by white people complicate Cal’s identity as half-white and half-Indian?” When and if students are ready to consider how Cal’s struggles with identity may mirror their own, encourage these reflections to be shared and navigated during the discussion, ensuring a safe environment in which to do so.

- An optional Mini Language Dive, intended for use after students read chapter 30 of *Two Roads* in Work Time A, is available in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lessons, students examined a variety of methods to increase variety into their sentence patterns to enhance meaning, engage reader interest, and add style. This lesson provides additional practice with this skill. Additionally, students have been reading the novel *Two Roads*, and they complete their reading in this lesson and engage in a text-based discussion about the novel as a whole.

Support All Students

- As an alternative, consider introducing the narrative writing task before students read chapter 30. This will help direct students’ attention to key elements of the chapter as they read, saving them time during the evidence-collection activities of later lessons. For ELLs that may struggle later to skim past chapters for evidence, this activity may be especially useful. ▲

- In addition to verbally describing the directions for this narrative-writing activity, consider creating a chart that visually presents each step. Additionally, select a pair of students or model with a student how to effectively participate. ▲

- During the text-based discussion, use strategic combinations of Conversation Cues as needed to help students clarify their contributions and think with others to expand the conversation. ▲ For example:

- “Can you say more about that?” (Goal 1)

- “So, do you mean \_\_\_?” (Goal 1)

- “Do you agree or disagree with what your classmate said? Why?” (Goal 4)

- “Who can add on to what your classmate said?” (Goal 4)

- For ELLs, better understanding the way that they learn, and being able to articulate it, is critical for developing flexible skills that can be applied to multiple contexts. If time allows, consider also using Goal 3 Conversation Cues to prompt reflection and support students’ metacognition at the end of the text-based discussion. ▲ For example:

- “What strategies helped you succeed during this discussion?”

- “How did this discussion add to your understanding of \_\_\_ (e.g., *Two Roads*; the module guiding questions; the development of Cal’s character)?”

- If students need a break from seated time, consider more dynamic alternatives to facilitate the text-based discussion. The Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol, for example, would allow students to move around and collaborate.

- To support ELLs, this lesson provides an opportunity for students to demonstrate their content and language knowledge through a text-based discussion built on their preparation in previous lessons. Also during this lesson, the narrative writing task that students will complete over the next two lessons is introduced. This writing task is not evaluative; rather, it is an instructional activity to prepare them for the argument later. Opportunities to write without being directly assessed may be especially helpful for ELLs who struggle or feel nervous to write.

- ELLs may find it challenging to finish reading *Two Roads* and move directly into writing tasks. Create time for students to celebrate having completed the anchor text—their third anchor text since Module 1! If feasible, design a supplemental reflective activity that asks students to process their thoughts at the close of the novel and celebrates their having completed another novel in English.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.3, 6.I.A.4, 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.8, 6.II.C.6, and 6.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- Instruction about sentence variety continues in this lesson with a focus on using a variety of sentence structures in their response to the entrance ticket. This QuickWrite also helps them to prepare for the text-based discussion, all of which connect to the narrative letter task they’ll be introduced to at the end of this lesson.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students continue practicing correct pronoun use, specifically in creating agreement of number and person between pronouns and their antecedents. They then use their Point of View and Character note-catchers to gather evidence for why Cal should return to Challagi at the end of the novel and for why Cal should not return to Challagi and should stay with Pop instead. Eventually they will analyze a model narrative letter from Cal to Possum and then write their own.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Preread chapter 30 of *Two Roads* to identify potentially challenging vocabulary or plot points. Mark the text on page 313 after “‘What now, son?’ he said” as a reminder to stop reading at that point.

- In this lesson, students finish reading the novel and discover what decision Cal makes about returning to school. Consider holding off on finishing the chapter until after students have prepared their arguments and written their narratives. Students may enjoy the suspense and a chance to argue the two sides of the argument without knowing what actually happens.

- Review the new materials used in this lesson to ensure clarity about what students will need to know and be able to do.

- Arrange the room for a large group discussion, or strategically arrange students into smaller discussion groups, if necessary.

- Prepare copies of handouts for students (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous modules to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RL.6.6, L.6.3a (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 10**. Students will also need the anchor text, ***Two Roads***, and a **highlighter**. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 10 (example for teacher reference)** for possible responses.

- Cold-call students to share an example of how they employed sentence variety in their response to the entrance ticket prompt.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar to or the same as previous lessons. Invite students to choose a habit of character focus for themselves for this lesson.

Work Time

A. Read *Two Roads*, Chapter 30 – RL.6.1 (20 minutes)

- Read chapter 30 aloud, stopping on page 313 after “‘What now, son?’ he said.” Use the **Text Guide: *Two Roads*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed.

- Pause and explain that students will have a chance to think about what decision Cal might make before they finish reading the chapter.

- Students continue to unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Students continue to identify how characters in the text demonstrate habits of character. Refer to the **chapter synopsis** as needed, as well as any other appropriate resources.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

B. Introduce Narrative Letter (5 minutes)

- Display the following prompt on the board, and read it aloud:

“Write a letter from Cal to Possum about whether Cal will return to Challagi Indian Industrial School at the end of the novel.

- Steps:

1\. Use a note-catcher to gather evidence to support Cal returning to school and to support Cal staying with Pop.

2\. Analyze a model narrative letter.

3\. Write your own narrative letter.”

- Read the prompt aloud as students read along silently.

- Explain that in the next two lessons, students will work through the three steps. For the end of unit assessment, they will revise their letter for pronoun use and sentence variety. Answer any clarifying questions without revealing what perspective students will take in their letters.

- Ask students to retrieve their copy of ***Two Roads*** and finish reading chapter 30, starting where they left off on page 313. Direct students to record the gist on **sticky notes**. Update the **Gist anchor chart: *Two Roads***, referring to the **Gist anchor chart: *Two Roads*** **(example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Gist of chapter 30: Cavalry are attacking and setting fire to the tent city. Cal finds Pop and tells him everything. Everyone is driven out of DC. Cal decides to return to Challagi.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time B, after students read chapter 30 of *Two Roads*, invite students to participate in a Mini Language Dive in small groups to examine a simile that highlights Cal’s growth in the novel (RL.6.3, L.6.5a). This Mini Language Dive also gives students the opportunity to explore word connotation (RL.6.4, L.6.5c) and the present perfect.

- As an extension to the Mini Language Dive of Work Time B, and as a way to reinforce work with L.6.2a, invite students to analyze the way that the author uses dashes to set off a parenthetical element in this sentence:— *like a jaybird* —. Students can compare the sentence from this lesson’s Mini Language Dive to that from the Language Dive in Lesson 6: *I know, partially from what I’ve learned about being Creek and partially because a part of me has always known, that my dreams are connecting me to other people*. Students can use the following questions to guide their analysis:

- What would you say is the same or different about the information set off by dashes or commas in these sentences? What does this suggest about the difference between dashes or commas?

- How do these punctuation marks “sound” when you read these sentences aloud? (Hint: they’re silent, but they might affect the way we read aloud).

- Do you use either of these punctuation marks when writing in your home language? How do you use them? Can you think of other ways that you set off parenthetical elements when writing in your home language?

For Heavier Support

- As an extension to the Mini Language Dive of Work Time B, encourage students to compare the Mini Language Dive sentence to the sentence from Module 3, Unit 1, Lesson 2 Mini Language Dive, which centered around the sentence: *“Now that I am going to Washington.”* Both of these sentences use the multi-word conjunction ‘ *now that* ’ but only the Mini Language Dive of this lesson uses it in a grammatically accurate way—that is, to introduce a dependent clause (*Now that I have finally stopped squawking*) that is then followed by an independent clause (*my throat is sore*). Provide sentence frames, with gradually released scaffolds, that students can complete to enhance their understanding of this structure. For example,

- Now that I have read *Two Roads*, I understand \_\_\_\_.

- Now that Cal has found Pop, \_\_\_\_.

- Now that \_\_\_\_, I can go home and play computer games.

- Now that \_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_.

Closing and Assessment

A. Engage in a Text-Based Discussion – SL.6.1 (15 minutes)

- Explain to students that they will be participating in a text-based discussion about *Two Roads*.

- Display the **Discussion Norms anchor chart** and remind students of the expectations for a collegial discussion.

- Display the discussion focus question: Should Cal return to Challagi Indian Industrial School?

- Invite students to move into a circle. Encourage them to reference their entrance ticket, **Analyze Character: *Two Roads*** **note-catcher**, and anchor text to ensure they use textual evidence to add to the discussion.

- Invite a volunteer to begin the discussion.

- Monitor the flow of discussion. Remind students to use their resources to make text-based connections if the discussion slows down.

- Use the following questions to spark more conversation if the discussions slows down:

- What benefits would Cal reap by going back to Challagi?

- What consequences of being at the school would Cal endure?

- How have the challenges Cal faced in the book influence his identity? How does Cal’s view of himself and his identity play into his decision to return to school or not?

- How might Cal returning to school strengthen some important relationships in his life and test others?

- Are there any other options besides the two presented: return or stay with Pop?

- With one minute remaining, regain student focus.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
