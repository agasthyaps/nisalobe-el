(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

Now that **I have finally stopped squawking**—like a jaybird—my throat is sore. (from page 308 of *Two Roads* by Joseph Bruchac)

**Lesson 8 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after students read chapter 28 of *Two Roads* in Work Time A.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target **(I can analyze how Cal responds and changes due to the events in the novel)** and RL.6.3 and RL.6.6 by illustrating how Cal has changed since the beginning of the novel and how he now identifies with a nickname first intended to be ironic. The sentence also helps students to address RL.6.4, L.6.5a, and L.6.5c by using a simile and an evocative verb with a precise connotation (**squawking**). Supporting standards: RL.6.1, SL.6.1.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses a resonant simile to highlight Cal’s growth, it features a verb (**squawking**) with a specific connotation to enhance the simile, it uses a verb written in the present perfect, and it includes a common multiword conjunction (**Now that**) to introduce a dependent clause.

- Transfer: Now that phrases with the present perfect to show relationships across events. Students can use a similar structure when writing their narrative letters to Possum in Lesson 12.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **Now that <u>I have finally stopped squawking</u>—like a jaybird—my throat is sore.**

- Say:

“What is this sentence about?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **I have finally stopped squawking**

- Say:

“What does the word squawking mean to you? What does it make you think of?” (Responses will vary.)

- If students struggle to answer the question above, tell them that **squawking** describes a loud, harsh cry and that this word is usually used to describe sounds made by a bird. If appropriate, invite students to practice squawking aloud!

“Can you figure out why the author used the word finally? How does the word finally help us understand Cal’s point of view toward his own speaking?” (The author probably used the word finally to suggest that Cal stopped talking after a long time. This adverb helps us understand that Cal believes he was talking a lot.)

“What do you notice about where the adverb finally has been inserted into the sentence?” (It has been inserted between have and stopped.)

- Students may recognize **have stopped** as an example of the present perfect, which they studied in Grade 5 (L.5.1b). Adverbs can be used with verbs written in the present perfect, and are often inserted in between the auxiliary verb and the past participle.

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **Now that <u>I have finally stopped squawking</u>—like a jaybird—my throat is sore.**

- Say:

“Based on this sentence, what would you say has changed about Cal since the beginning of the novel?” (Cal used to be so quiet. Now he is talking so much that his throat is sore.)

“Why do you think the author chose to include the simile like a jaybird in this sentence?” (Responses will vary, but may include: the author probably chose to include this simile to show that Cal sees himself in the nickname he was given or that he sees himself in a new way.)

“What does Cal’s use of this simile tell us about his point of view toward his identity or about his development as a character?” (Responses will vary, but may include: this simile shows that Cal identifies with being called a jaybird now. He seems to have positive and warm feelings toward his new identity and toward the friends who gave him that nickname.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target:  
I can analyze how Cal responds and changes due to the events in the novel?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:
