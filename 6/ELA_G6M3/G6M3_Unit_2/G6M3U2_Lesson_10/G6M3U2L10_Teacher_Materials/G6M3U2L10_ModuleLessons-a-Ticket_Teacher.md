Sample student response:

Cal’s point of view toward his identity at this point in the novel has gotten a lot more complex. He still has his identity as a knight of the road, but his world has expanded. He has embraced and grown into this Creek identity, but he also realizes that he doesn’t have to choose. He understands that his identity is not fixed. Because of his time and his friends at Challagi, he has grown up and gained confidence in and knowledge about himself.
