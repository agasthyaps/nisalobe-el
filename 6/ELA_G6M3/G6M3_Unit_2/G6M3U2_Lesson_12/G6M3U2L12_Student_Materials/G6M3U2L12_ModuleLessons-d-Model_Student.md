Dear Possum,

This is your good friend, Cal, writing to you. I made it to Washington, DC and found Pop. It took me four days of traveling, on train and on foot, to get here, but I made it. Pop was so happy to see me. He cried and hugged me, and he wasn’t mad at all that I left Challagi after promising that I’d stay. Like the squawking jaybird I am, I talked to Pop for a long time about Challagi. I told him about my classes and the plot of land I’m farming. I told him about my horse Dakota. I told him about Little Coon, Bear Meat, and Deacon, and how Deacon helped me understand the vision I had on the last night at Challagi, the one that brought me to Pop. Of course, I also told him about you. He remembers you from the first day, but he’s heard a lot more now. He knows that you are the best friend I’ve ever had.

The veterans’ campaign here in Washington isn’t over yet, but Pop’s acting different about it. A couple nights ago, he asked me, “What now, son?” When he first went to Washington, Pop told me I had to go to Challagi. Now, it’s my choice what happens next: do I stay here with Pop or do I come back to Challagi? I’ve been thinking about this a lot, and I think I know what I need to do. I need to stay here with Pop.

I was only ever supposed to be at Challagi temporarily. Pop thought I was too young to join him in DC and help with the veterans’ army. He wanted to know that I was somewhere safe, with a bed to sleep in and meals to eat. Challagi was a place for me to have those things and also an education. But Pop seems to see me differently now. He saw that I could live independently and make my own friendships. He saw that I could hold to my promises and give Challagi a real try. He saw that I could protect him by listening to my instincts and trusting my premonitions. I think he sees me as more of a grown-up now, which is why he is leaving the choice up to me.

All of this is why I’ve decided to stay with Pop, and not return to Challagi. It makes me sad to imagine not seeing you and the gang anymore, but I know that this is what is right for me. I feel more grown-up now, and I feel like I can be a helpful part of the veterans’ army. If I have any other visions about Pop, I can tell him right away and keep him safe. As much as I’ll miss all of you at Challagi, Pop is my family, and keeping us together is the most important thing to me.

Thanks for being such a good friend to me, Possum. You helped make a home for me while Pop and I were apart. I know we’ll see each other again someday.

Cal
