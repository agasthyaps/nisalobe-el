Homework: Practice Pronouns and  
Sentence Variety: *Two Roads*

(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Read the excerpt, and complete the following items to correct and explain the pronoun use. If the pronoun in bold is used correctly, select the “no change” option.

I’m sitting with Pop by the fire pit in front of his camp. His billet’s nothing more than a tent with a camp chair and a cot and a few rugs spread out on the dirt floor. But **\[1\] it** feels more like home to me because Pop is there.

I’ve been talking for the better part of an hour—even more than after our sweat back at Challagi. Pop’s just listened, not interrupting even once. I’ve told him everything, even about my vision, and **\[2\] they’ve** just listened, nodding now and then, understanding and believing  
**\[3\] I** as he always does.

1.  “His billet’s nothing more than a tent with a camp chair and a cot and a few rugs spread out on the dirt floor. But **it** feels more like home to me because Pop is there” (308).

Which word or phrase best replaces **it**? (L.6.1a, L.6.1c, L.6.1d)

2.  no change

3.  <u>Pop’s camp</u>

4.  the dirt floor

5.  a few rugs

Explain why the answer you chose is correct.

I changed “it” to “Pop’s camp” because the antecedent is ambiguous, since the most immediate noun before the “it” is the dirt floor, but clearly he is talking about Pop’s campsite, not just the floor.

6.  “Pop’s just listened, not interrupting even once. I’ve told him everything, even about my vision, and **they’ve** just listened, nodding now and then, understanding and believing I as he always does” (308).

Which word or phrase best replaces **they’ve**? (L.6.1a, L.6.1c, L.6.1d)

7.  no change

8.  its

9.  his

10. <u>he’s</u>

Explain why the answer you chose is correct.

I changed “they’ve” to “he’s” because this pronoun refers to Pop, so it needs to be singular. “They” is a plural pronoun so it is not correct here.

11. “Pop’s just listened, not interrupting even once. I’ve told him everything, even about my vision, and they’ve just listened, nodding now and then, understanding and believing **I** as he always does” (308).

Which word or phrase best replaces **I**? (L.6.1a, L.6.1c, L.6.1d)

12. no change

13. us

14. <u>me</u>

15. you

Explain why the answer you chose is correct.

I changed this to “me” because “I” is the subjective case, and the objective is what’s needed in this context.

16. Revise the excerpt below to improve its sentence variety and meaning. Explain why the changes you made help to better convey meaning. (W.6.10, L.6.3a)

I’m sorry for the pain you’ve felt. I’m glad for you, too. It sounds like you found some real friends.

Answers will vary, but may include: I’m sorry for the pain you’ve felt, but I’m glad for you, too, because it sounds like you found some real friends.

I combined all three sentences. I used “but” to combine the first two because it makes it clearer that the sentence that follows will say something different than the first. I then used “because” to show the relationship between the last two sentences. Pop is happy for Cal because he has good friends. These changes make the meaning clearer for the reader to understand for these reasons.
