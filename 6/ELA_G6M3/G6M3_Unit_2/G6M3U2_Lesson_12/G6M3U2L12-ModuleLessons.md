Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- L.6.1d – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they revise sentences to correct a vague or ambiguous pronoun.

- W.6.4 – Work Time A: Students analyze a model narrative letter. This exercise supports students in producing their own clear and coherent narrative letters during Work Time B.

- RL.6.1 – Work Time B: Students write a narrative letter from Cal to Possum, in which they announce Cal’s plans to return to Challagi Indian Industrial School. They use evidence from the text to support their ideas.

- RL.6.3 – Work Time B: In their narrative letters, written from Cal’s perspective, students illustrate ways in which Cal has changed over the course of the text.

- W.6.3 – Work Time B: Students write narrative letters, imagining that they are Cal. They use relevant descriptive details and structured event sequence.

- W.6.4 – Work Time B: Students produce narrative letters, whose organization and style are appropriate for the task, purpose, and audience.

- W.6.9a – Work Time B: Students apply Grade 6 Reading standards to literature writing narrative letters that illustrate the way that Cal has changed across *Two Roads*.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Consider expanding this narrative letter to a more formal and assessed writing task. This can be done with additional mini lessons on author’s craft with a focus on conveying Cal’s character through the use of language.

- Recording, listening to, and reflecting on one’s own speech can be a valuable strategy for improving fluency, intonation, and overall clarity. If possible, consider making the recordings from Closing and Assessment A available to ELLs after class. Encourage students to listen to themselves read their letters aloud and then reflect on the effectiveness of their recording, thinking of stars and steps for future speaking work. Urge students to move beyond critique of their accents—everyone speaks with an accent, and accents are an important part of who we are!—and instead consider aspects of their speech like volume, pacing, enunciation, and intonation. ▲

- Task selected students with experimenting with different audio recording tools. Invite them to determine the tool they believe will work best for the End of Unit 3 Assessment and model for the class how to use the resource. Incorporate argument writing skills by having them write a claim, supported by reasons, evidence, and reasoning to justify their choice of audio recording tool.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students gathered evidence to use to write a narrative letter from Cal to Possum. In this lesson they write the letter after studying a model. They have also previously had instruction about pronoun case and sentence variety. This lesson continues and expands that instruction as final preparation for the end of unit assessment.

Support All Students

- Because the narratives are written as personal letters, specific narrative structural elements of their writing are less important. The main purpose of using letter as a structure is to mirror the writing that happens in the plot and to gain insight into the main character and the reasoning for his decisions. Additionally, the revised narratives will be assessed for language standards, not writing standards, for the end of unit assessment. The model analysis focuses on some basic features of letter writing and on the content being conveyed from Cal’s perspective and with language that is consistent with what students have come to understand about him and his relationship with Possum. Support students by clearly delineating these standards and expectations before they begin to write. Remind students they are not going to be assessed on their narrative writing ability; during Lesson 13, which is the end of unit assessment, they will revise their letter for use of pronouns and sentence variety.

- Help students practice empathy and imagination as they write letters to Possum from Cal. Increase engagement by encouraging them to apply what they know about Cal’s relationship with Possum to their letters.

- To support ELLs, this lesson invites students to analyze a model narrative letter and then write their own, from Cal’s perspective, to Possum, informing Possum that Cal will be returning to Challagi Indian Industrial School. This writing task builds upon students’ research in the previous lesson, provides additional opportunities to engage with the characters and content of *Two Roads*, and extends students’ work with pronouns by providing an organic written space for pronouns to occur naturally and in context. The thinking behind students’ letters will help prepare them for the argument essays that they write in Unit 3. At the end of the lesson, students record themselves reading their narrative letters aloud, hinting at the recordings students will produce during the performance task at the end of the module. The cohesion of this lesson and its connectedness to earlier and later work in the module make its purpose especially clear and allows ELLs to see relationships across their learning.

- ELLs may find it challenging to complete a narrative letter from Cal to Possum in the allotted time. Remind students that this letter is not an assessment and mistakes are OK—in fact, mistakes are necessary for the end of unit assessment of the following lesson to be effective! Encourage students to approach this letter as they would an extended QuickWrite.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.B.6, 6.I.C.11, 6.1.C.12, 6.II.A.1, 6.II.A.2, and 6.II.B.3.

Assessment Guidance

- The recording completed during Closing and Assessment A in this lesson does not specify the method to be used. This activity is included here for two reasons. The first is so that students can practice using the recording methods that they will use for the performance task, and the second is to provide an additional opportunity for students to practice their fluency and speaking skills. Adjust the specifics of this activity as necessary based on student needs and site resources.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students take the end of unit assessment, in which they revise their narrative letter for pronoun usage and sentence variety.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare the recording equipment and/or application for use during Closing and Assessment A. Depending on the chosen recording application, students may need headphones, microphones, and/or computers. Additionally, depending on the recording tool chosen, students may need to create individual student accounts on the platform. As an alternative, consider setting up one class account and having all students all use the same login information.

- Review the student tasks and example answers to get familiar with what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Prepare copies of handouts for students (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time B: Students could compose the narrative letter using an online word processing tool such as http://eled.org/0158.

- Closing and Assessment A: Select an audio recording tool, such as http://eled.org/0180 or http://eled.org/0211.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.6.1d (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 12.** Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 12 (example for teacher reference)** for possible responses.

- Using a preferred classroom routine, collect or review the answers to **Homework: Practice Pronouns: *Two Roads***. Refer to **Homework: Practice Pronouns: *Two Roads*** **(answers for teacher reference)**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar to or the same as previous lessons. Invite students to choose a habit of character focus for themselves for this lesson.

Work Time

A. Analyze a Model Narrative Letter: Cal Stays with Pop – W.6.4 (10 minutes)

- Explain that in this lesson, students will first analyze a model letter to Possum from Cal that explains why he is staying with Pop. Then they will write a letter to Possum from Cal explaining why he is returning to school. Remind them they will also use this evidence and these narratives to help them write a literary argument essay in the next unit.

- Direct students to retrieve their **Independent Argument Evidence note-catcher**.

- Distribute and display the **Model Narrative Letter: Cal Stays with Pop**.

- Read the model aloud as students follow along, reading silently.

- Using a total participation technique, invite responses from the group:

“What is this text about?” (It is a letter to Possum from Cal, explaining why he is not returning to school and instead is going to stay with Pop.)

- Point out that even though this is a letter format, the writer uses reasons and evidence to support her points.

- Ask:

“What are the reasons Cal gives for staying with Pop?” (His stay at Challagi was only supposed to be temporary; Cal has become older and more mature.)

“Did you have those reasons on your evidence note-catcher?” What other reasons did you have?” (Answers will vary. Sample student responses: Pop needs Cal to protect him, and Pop wants Cal to stay with him.)

“What makes this a letter and not an essay?” (There is a greeting and a signature. The style is more informal. The author uses personal pronouns.)

“What do you notice about the way the letter is written?” (It is written from Cal’s perspective and is written in the first person (I), it is written to Possum and uses the second person (you), it sounds like what Cal really would say to Possum, the variety of English the writer uses is consistent with how Cal speaks to Possum in the novel.)

- After guiding students through analyzing the model, invite them to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target, using a checking for understanding technique. Scan student responses and make a note of students who might need support. Check in with them moving forward.

For Lighter Support

- If time allows after Work Time A, consider inviting students who need lighter support to share with the class how conventions of letter writing in their home languages or cultures may be similar to or different from the model narrative letter. Raising awareness of these similarities or differences may help students draw connections that help them during their own writing.

For Heavier Support

- During the model analysis of Work Time A, consider reprinting the Model Narrative Letter: Cal Stays with Pop in large font, with space to take notes, or in chunks that separate the letter by its parts or paragraphs. Students who need heavier support may benefit from having multiple ways to engage with the text of the letter.

Work Time

B. Write a Narrative Letter: Cal Returns to School – W.6.3 (20 minutes)

- Explain that now that students have analyzed the model, they will write their own narrative letter from Cal to Possum about his decision to return to Challagi.

- Direct students to review their reasons and evidence for why Cal should return to Challagi on their Independent Argument Evidence note-catcher. Tell them to star two reasons that they want to explore in their letter.

- Invite students to begin writing. As students work, circulate to monitor and support them as needed. Encourage them to use the model and their note-catcher as they draft. Refer to **Narrative Letter: Cal Returns to School (example for teacher reference)**.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Closing and Assessment

A. Record Narrative Letter – SL.6.4 (10 minutes)

- Remind students that for their performance task they will be hosting an audio museum that features voices of those who experienced the American Indian boarding schools. Part of that work will involve recording themselves reading and reflecting on their chosen contribution. Explain that in order to gain experience recording themselves, they will practice with the technology and record themselves reading their narrative letter.

- Direct students to use the preferred, available recording technology to record themselves reading their narrative letter. Demonstrate how to use the tool, or assign a student who is particularly proficient with technology to do so. Distribute any audio recording equipment students might need, such as headphones or microphones.

- If time allows, invite students to share their reflections about recording themselves, including what went well and what they would like to work on.

- Remind students that this is just a practice opportunity, and they will have more practice with this process and technology in the later lessons. Encourage them to tinker with the audio recording resources on their own.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their habit of character focus for this lesson.

Homework

A. Practice Pronouns and Sentence Variety

- Students complete **Homework: Practice Pronouns and Sentence Variety: *Two Roads***.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
