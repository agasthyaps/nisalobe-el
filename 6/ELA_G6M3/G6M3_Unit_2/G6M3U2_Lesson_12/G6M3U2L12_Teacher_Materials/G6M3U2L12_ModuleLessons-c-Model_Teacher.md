**Topic:** Cal returns to Challagi.

Dear Possum,

RL.6.1, W.6.9a: Incorporates several examples of textual evidence to demonstrate understanding of the plot and character of *Two Roads*.

RL.6.3, W.6.9a: Demonstrates how Cal changes and responds as the plot moves towards a resolution.

W.6.3: Narrative is written with relevant descriptive details and well-structured event sequences.

This is your good friend, Cal, writing to you. I made it to Washington, DC and found Pop. It took me four days of traveling, on train and on foot, to get here, but I made it. Pop was so happy to see me. He cried and hugged me, and he wasn’t mad at all that I left Challagi after promising that I’d stay. Like the squawking jaybird I am, I talked to Pop for a long time about Challagi. I told him about my classes and the plot of land I’m farming. I told him about my horse Dakota. I told him about Little Coon, Bear Meat, and Deacon, and how Deacon helped me understand the vision I had on the last night at Challagi, the one that brought me to Pop. Of course, I also told him about you. He remembers you from the first day, but he’s heard a lot more now. He knows that you are the best friend I’ve ever had.

The veterans’ campaign here in DC isn’t over yet, but Pop’s acting different about it. A couple nights ago, he asked me, “What now, son?” When he first went to Washington, DC, Pop told me I had to go to Challagi. Now, it’s my choice what happens next: do I stay here with Pop or do I come back to Challagi? I’ve been thinking about this a lot, and I think I know what I need to do. I need to come back to Challagi.

When Pop first brought me to Challagi, I was so scared. I didn’t know anyone and I didn’t know how to be away from Pop. So much has changed since then. Now I have a group of brothers, my Creek brothers. I have learned how to stomp dance and say some Creek phrases. I’m studying agricultural science and get to spend time with Dakota. Sure, I don’t like Superintendent Morrell or all the marching we have to do, and I really don’t like getting punched in the ribs by Bear Meat. But I feel like I am growing so much every day. I can’t stop now.

W.6.4: Narrative letter is clear and coherent and matches the task, purpose, and audience.

All of this is why I’ve decided to leave Pop for now and return to Challagi. I want to keep learning and keep building my friendships with you and the rest of the gang. It’s funny because, when I first got to Challagi, all I wanted was to be with Pop. But something has changed in me since then. Maybe I’ve grown up, and I feel better about being independent. I even feel like I might want to start my own campaign against Challagi, in order to fight for all of us there. I can’t do that from far away.

Thank you for being such a good friend to me, Possum. Your friendship feels like home to me now. See you soon.

Cal
