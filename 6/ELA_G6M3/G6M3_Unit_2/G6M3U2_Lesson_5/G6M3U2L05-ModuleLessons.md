Opportunities to Extend Learning

- In this chapter, the gang participates in a stomp dance. It is likely that students have not heard of a stomp dance before. Consider supplementing this lesson with a short blurb explaining what the stomp dance is and the role it plays in some American Indian communities:

“The term ‘Stomp Dance’ is an English term, which refers to the ‘shuffle and stomp” movements of the dance. In the native Muskogee language the dance is called *Opvnkv Haco*, which can mean ‘drunken,’ ‘crazy,” or ‘inspirited’ dance. This usually refers to the exciting, yet meditative effect the dance and the medicine have on the participants. In the native Shawnee language, the dance is called *Nikanikawe* which refers to a dance involving friends or *nikane*. It is also called the Leading Dance by many Shawnees, but most simply call it the ‘Stomp Dance.’”

How It Builds on Previous Work

- This lesson builds on students’ learning about connotation, figurative language, text structure, and theme, and releases students to work with a partner to synthesize their understanding in constructed response answers. This work mimics the expectations of the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment.

Support All Students

- Chapter 24 briefly addresses some of the disparities in treatment and expectations of boys and girls at Challagi. More specifically, it points out that “matrons in the girls’ dormitories watch over them like hawks all through the day and owls all through the night,” whereas the boys have a great deal of freedom (253). Cal says that this “makes \[him\] feel sorry for those girls” (253). As a related extension, and one that brings in the voices of female students of American Indian boarding schools, consider inviting students to undertake short research projects to explore the duties, treatment, or experiences of girls at American Indian boarding schools, and analyze how these were similar to or different from the reported experiences of boys. Note that it may be necessary to screen research resources ahead of time to limit the likelihood that students unearth potentially traumatic information.

- To support ELLs, this lesson builds upon students’ past learning about connotation, figurative language, text structure, and theme and provides opportunities for students to collaborate and synthesize this learning through text-based questions. These text-based questions are similar in content and format to questions that students will encounter on the mid-unit assessment of Lesson 7.

- ELLs may find it challenging plan a literary analysis paragraph during Closing and Assessment A. Consider modeling the process of connecting textual evidence to theme before inviting students to do so during a Think-Pair-Share protocol.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.B.6, 6.II.B.5, and 6.II.C.6.

Assessment Guidance

- The text-dependent questions in Work Time B demonstrate increased rigor as students are expected to answer constructed response questions rather than selected response to explain their thinking and incorporate textual evidence.

- Use a mnemonic, such as an acronym or visual metaphor, to help students remember the essential parts of a paragraph.

Down the Road

- The next lesson offers a final practice of essential skills before the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment in Lesson 7. Students will read two more chapters in the anchor text, bringing them to the moment where Cal decides to run away from Challagi. A Language Dive provides one more opportunity to practice determining possible themes that are emerging in *Two Roads* and analyzing the development of Cal’s character.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.6.1a (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 5**. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 5 (example for teacher reference)** for possible responses.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar to or the same as previous lessons. Invite students to choose a habit of character focus for themselves for this lesson.

Work Time

A. Read *Two Roads*, Chapter 24 – RL.6.6 (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Read chapter 24 of the text, using **Text Guide: *Two Roads*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students who are ready to read independently or in small groups should be released to this independence. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky notes**, update the **Gist anchor chart: *Two Roads***, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Students continue to identify how characters in the text demonstrate habits of character. Refer to the **Gist anchor chart: *Two Roads*** **(example for teacher reference)** and **chapter synopsis** as needed, as well as any other appropriate resources.

- Gist: Cal learns about his Creek identity from his friends at school. They teach him about stomp dancing.

- Turn and Talk:

“How does the way Cal talks about the woods help to develop our understanding of his and the gang’s point of view toward being in nature?” (They see it as a place of freedom, escape, and friendship. They can be themselves and forget about the bad things they experience at the school.)

- Refocus students, and direct them to retrieve their **Analyze Point of View: *Two Roads*** **note-catcher**. Instruct students to fill in the row for chapter 24 using the examples discussed. Using a total participation technique, invite students to share their responses. Refer to **Analyze Point of View: *Two Roads*** **(example for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

B. Complete Text-Dependent Questions – RL.6.2 (15 minutes)

- Distribute and display **Text-Dependent Questions: *Two Roads***, **Chapter 24**.

- Direct students to work in small groups to respond to the text-dependent questions. They should be prepared to share their responses during Closing and Assessment A. As students work, continue to circulate and support students as needed, pushing them back into the text for evidence to support their responses.

- Refocus the whole group.

- Briefly review each text-dependent question, and cold-call students to share their responses with the whole group. Focus particularly on question 2, as this question might need further teaching or explanation, depending on student responses. Refer to the **Text-Dependent Questions: *Two Roads***, **Chapter 24 (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time B, as students complete text-dependent questions about chapter 24 of *Two Roads*, strategically use combinations of Conversation Cues to help students who need lighter support to listen to one another and deepen their thinking. For example:

- “Can you say more about that?” (Goal 1)

- “Who can tell us what your classmate said in your own words?” (Goal 2)

- “What, in the text, makes you think so?” (Goal 3)

- “Who can explain why your classmate came up with that response?” (Goal 4)

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time B, as students complete text-dependent questions about chapter 24 of *Two Roads*, strategically use combinations of Conversation Cues to help students who need heavier support to listen to one another and expand the conversation. For example:

- “I’ll give you time to discuss this with a partner.” (Goal 1)

- “Who can repeat what your classmate said?” (Goal 2)

- “Do you agree or disagree with what your classmate said? Why?” (Goal 4)

- “So, do you mean \_\_\_?” (Goal 1)

Closing and Assessment

A. Plan a Literary Analysis Paragraph – RL.6.2 (10 minutes)

- Focus students on the **Determine Themes: *Two Roads*** **anchor chart**. Point out that one of the themes previously identified is present in chapter 24 again—Our peers, our school, our families, and our experiences can affirm or threaten our identities.

- Explain that students will learn to synthesize their thinking on this subject in a cohesive and structured literary analysis paragraph.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What additional text evidence can be found in this chapter to support this theme?” (“I no longer feel like an out-of-place white boy, the way I did before. I feel like I belong to our gang. Maybe I’m not totally Indian, but I’m not the same as I was before. I’m seeing things another way” (253). “Soon all of us are dancing, including me – an Indian boy who thought he was white, following a white boy who knows he’s Indian” (259).)

- Update the Determine Themes: *Two Roads* anchor chart with student responses to the theme question. Refer to the **Determine Themes: *Two Roads*** **anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Distribute and display the **Paragraph Planner: *Two Roads***, **Chapter 24**. Explain that students only need to plan their literary analysis paragraph during this time; they will complete the last step, composing the paragraph, for homework. Refer to **Paragraph Planner: *Two Roads***, **Chapter 24 (example for teacher reference)**, as needed.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their habit of character focus for this lesson.

For Lighter Support

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from chapter 21 of *Two Roads*. Consider providing ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Invite students who need lighter support to choose one of the following tasks to complete in preparation for the Language Dive. Students should select a <u>different</u> task from the one they completed before the Language Dive of Lesson 2:

- Paraphrase the sentence using your own words.

- Generate three questions that could be asked about the sentence during a Language Dive.

- Underline all pronouns, check all nouns, circle all verbs, and star all adjectives. What words do you have left? What are the function of these words?

For Heavier Support

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from chapter 26 of *Two Roads*. Consider providing ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Invite students who need heavier support to choose one of the following tasks to complete in preparation for the Language Dive. Students should select a <u>different</u> task from the one they completed before the Language Dive of Lesson 2:

- Make a guess about what the “chunks” of the sentence might be.

- Use a dictionary to look up the word *treated* and select the best definition for the word as it is used in this sentence.

- Write a question to ask Cal about his thoughts in this sentence.

Homework

A. Write a Literary Analysis Paragraph

- Students complete their Paragraph Planner: *Two Roads*, Chapter 24 by writing a complete literary analysis paragraph.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread chapters 25 and 26 in *Two Roads* in preparation for studying these chapters in the next lesson.
