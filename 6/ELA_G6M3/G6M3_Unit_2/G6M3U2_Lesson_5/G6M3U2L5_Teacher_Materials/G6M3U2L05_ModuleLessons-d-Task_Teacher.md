**Directions:** Answer the following questions, using evidence from the text to support your ideas where appropriate.

1.  “That one question that came to mind was like opening a door. At first there’s just a crack and then it swings wider. A cold breeze blows in from the other side. But all it brings me are more questions I can’t answer” (257).

What is the connotation of the figurative language used in the excerpt? What does the connotation of the figurative language in the excerpt above convey about Cal’s point of view toward Pop?

The connotation of the “cold breeze” blowing open the door is negative and threatening. Cal feels worried about Pop because he hasn’t heard from him. He also realizes he is worried about how Pop’s decisions and experiences might impact him, too. The figurative language shows us that Cal feels like he doesn’t have control of his thoughts or his questions, just like we can’t control the weather. The cold breeze is also an unwelcome visitor that interrupts this special time with the gang.

2.  This question has two parts. First, answer Part A. Then, answer Part B.

**Part A**

How does chapter 24 function within the structure of the novel?

This chapter reinforces the ideas about the woods that were introduced in chapter 13, that the woods as a setting are a special place of escape and bonding for the boys. Cal suggests this when he says, “But we boys have a kind of freedom in the woods that’s almost as good as what I felt riding the rails with Pop. Almost” (253). This is also shown when Deacon tells Cal, “The woods are where you can get away, where you’re no longer here” (250). The woods are also the site of important times when the boys can connect to their Creek heritage, and when the reader can understand more about that heritage.

**Part B**

How does this chapter help to develop the setting and plot of the novel?

This chapter helps to develop the setting of Challagi by showing the differences between the boys’ experiences within the school buildings and when they are in the natural world. “All of us joined together and free in a song older than our breath and stronger than all the Challagi rules” (259). This chapter also helps to develop the plot of the novel, because the woods are clearly a location for events that are important to moving the plot and characters forward. During the stomp dance, Cal thinks, “I no longer feel like an out-of-place white boy, the way I did before. I feel like I belong to our gang. Maybe I’m not totally Indian, but I’m not the same as I was before. I’m seeing things another way” (253).
