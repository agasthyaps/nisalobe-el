Answers will vary, but may include: Chapter 24 of *Two Roads* by Joseph Bruchac helps to develop the theme that “our peers, our school, our families, and our experiences can affirm or threaten our identities.” This theme was first introduced earlier in the novel. It is further developed as Cal becomes more comfortable with his Creek identity. In this chapter, Cal participates in a stomp dance. He also learns the chants that are sung during the dances. He finally feels comfortable with his Creek friends and his Creek identity. This is clear when he says “I no longer feel like an out-of-place white boy, the way I did before. I feel like I belong to our gang. Maybe I’m not totally Indian, but I’m not the same as I was before. I’m seeing things another way” (253). Later, Tommy, who looks white but is a proud American Indian, arrives at the stomp dance. Cal reflects, “Soon all of us are dancing, including me—an Indian boy who thought he was white, following a white boy who knows he’s Indian” (259). The author develops this theme around identity to help the reader understand that one’s identity can change and evolve over time. This shows that coming to terms with one’s identity is a natural and universal human experience.
