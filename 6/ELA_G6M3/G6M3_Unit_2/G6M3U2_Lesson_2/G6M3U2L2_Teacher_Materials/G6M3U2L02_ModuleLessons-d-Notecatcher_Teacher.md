(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Answer the questions as your teacher reads the first section of chapter 21 in *Two Roads*. Complete the questions with your partner.

Page 217, Paragraph 1:

1.  What does Cal mean when he says, “When I first arrived, I was expecting Indians.”? What does he imply about what he actually found at the school?

He means he used to hold a stereotype of what it meant to look or act Indian—a singular, homogeneous concept of “Indian-ness.” He is implying that what he actually found was different from that.

Page 217, Paragraphs 2 and 3:

2.  How does the first sentence of paragraph 2 build on the first paragraph?

The sentence explains that he found the school to be very different from what he’d expected.

3.  What do these sentences reveal about how the students at the school see one another?

The ethnic divisions seem to be important at the school. There appears to be a hierarchy—the full blood Indians look down on the mixed blood students, and everyone seems to look down on the students who look white.

Pages 218–219:

4.  What does Cal mean when he says, “Me, I grew up just thinking of myself as a person. Being white means you have the luxury of doing that.”?

He means that, because he was white in a mostly white society, he never had to think about what group he belonged to. This line alludes to the idea that, in predominantly white communities, white people are often not expected to critically analyze their own whiteness, and thus can see themselves as individuals absent of race. This privilege is not typically extended to people of color.

5.  What do the teacher’s actions in this scene reveal about her point of view toward her students? What evidence supports your thinking?

Mrs. Tygue seems disconnected and unfeeling toward her students. She speaks to them in commands, such as “Stand up.” She refers to Cal as “New student” rather than learning his name.

6.  In your own words, restate the insight conveyed in the lines of the poem that Cal recites.

Answers will vary, but may include: A person’s race or birthplace should not be the measure by which they are judged.

Pages 220–221:

7.  Why do you think the author includes this incident?

It shows how hard it is to be seen as a white kid in this school; it shows how aware Cal is of what it means to be Indian here, and how he fits in to the whole hierarchy.

Page 221:

8.  What does Cal realize about . . .

| the Challagi school?   | **He realizes that it’s almost as hard to be white here as it is to be Indian in the outside world.** |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| his identity?          | **He is lucky not to be treated as an outsider, because he is Indian.**                               |
| his beliefs or values? | **He believes that people shouldn’t be treated badly because of how they were born.**                 |

9.  How does the scene in which Cal recites the poem connect to Cal’s statement at the end of this excerpt?

The poem reinforces Cal’s thinking at the end of the excerpt. Cal is realizing that one’s identity extends far beyond their race or birthplace; no one should be judged solely on the way they were born.

**Culminating Task**

The following theme could be inferred from this excerpt: Finding one’s identity often involves recognizing one’s values. What evidence from the text supports this theme?

The more time that Cal spends at Challagi, the more time he spends thinking critically about issues of ethnicity and identity. He is realizing that, when it comes to race, he cares more about the person than the label. For example, a boy at the school, Tommy, has light skin but yearns to be seen as more than a *stahitkey*, or white boy. Cal has had the experience of being accepted as white in a world that discriminates against Indians. He has also been accepted by the Indians in a school that looks down on whites. Having experienced the benefits and consequences of each, he concludes that he does not approve of people being judged harshly “just for being born who they were” (221).
