Chapter 21 Excerpt

RL.6.1, RL.6.2, RL.6.3

(For Teacher Reference)

**Purpose and Notes**

- The purpose of this close read is for students to analyze a text excerpt from *Two Roads* for how it reveals a particular theme. In addition, students analyze how the main character, Cal, is changing in response to his experiences at Challagi Indian Industrial School.

- This close read focuses on the first few pages of chapter 21 in *Two Roads*, starting at the beginning of chapter 21 on page 217 and ending on page 221 at “ . . . just for being born who they were.” Note that this is the first time that students have read this chapter.

- Rereads these pages aloud, and prompt students to follow along silently. From time to time, have students reread portions of the text in order to answer text-dependent questions.

- Students work in pairs for this close read.

- A note-catcher, along with text-dependent questions provides an opportunity for students to respond to the questions posed by the teacher during the close read.

- Continue to use discussion protocols (e.g., Turn and Talk, cold call, and total participation techniques) to engage all students in collaborative discussion about the text.

- NOTE: there are places where students are asked to underline. If this is not possible, they could use sticky flags instead.

<li><p>Distribute the Close Read: <em>Two Roads</em>, Chapter 21 Excerpt note-catcher.</p></li>
<li><p>Explain that we are about to read and zero in on an important section of chapter 21 in <em>Two Roads</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Focus students on page 217 and direct them to quickly skim and scan the excerpt up to page 221, ending at “ . . . just for being born who they were.”</p></li>
<li><p>Quickly establish the gist of this section: Cal has just arrived at the Challagi boarding school; this is his first day of class. In English class, they study a poem, and Cal, who is normally silent, responds to the teacher’s question about the poem.</p></li>
<li><p>First, remind students what they know about Cal’s experience up to this point in the text.</p></li>

<li><p>Working in partners, direct students to discuss, and then record in their note-catchers, their responses to this question: “What does Cal mean when he says, ‘When I first arrived, I was expecting Indians.’ What does he imply about what he actually found at the school?” (He means he used to hold a stereotype of what it meant to look or act Indian—a singular, homogeneous concept of “Indian-ness.” He is implying that what he actually found was different from that.)</p></li>

<td><ul>
<li><p>Read the text aloud as students follow along, reading silently.</p></li>
<li><p>Working in partners, direct students to discuss, and then record in their note-catchers: “How does the first sentence of paragraph 2 build on the first paragraph?” (The sentence explains that he found the school to be very different from what he’d expected.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “What are the three groups of students that Cal describes here?” (Full-blooded Indian students, “mixed bloods” with only one Indian parent, and white students who have limited Indian ancestry.)</p></li>
<li><p>Say: “Underline the sentence ‘<strong>They are real sensitive whenever a full-blood says they’re not real Indians.</strong>’ Then underline the sentence ‘<strong>They’re the ones who get called <em>stahitkey</em>, white boy.</strong>’”</p></li>
<li><p>Ask, then record on note-catchers: “What do these sentences reveal about how the students at the school see each other?” (The ethnic divisions seem to be important at the school. There appears to be a hierarchy—the full-blood Indians look down on the mixed-blood students, and everyone seems to look down on the students who look white.)</p></li>
</ul></td>

<tr class="even">
<td>Read aloud paragraph 4 on page 217—the single sentence: “<em>Us Creeks</em>. I just said that, didn’t I?”</td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Read the text aloud as students follow along, reading silently.</p></li>
<li><p>Use a total participation technique to ask: “What realization does Cal have in this moment?” (He seems surprised that he is beginning to think of himself as an Indian, specifically as Creek. This is a change for him.)</p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Read from the bottom of page 217, starting at “some of those white-looking Indian kids” to the middle of page 218, ending at “then he married a Norwegian lady.”</td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Read the text aloud as students follow along, reading silently.</p></li>
<li><p>Working in partners, direct students to discuss, and then record in their note-catchers, their responses to this question: “What does Cal mean when he says, ‘Me, I grew up just thinking of myself as a person. Being white means you have the luxury of doing that.’” (He means that, because he was white in a mostly white society, he never had to think about what group he belonged to. This line alludes to the idea that, in predominantly white communities, white people are often not expected to critically analyze their own whiteness, and thus can see themselves as individuals absent of race. This privilege is not typically extended to people of color.)</p></li>
<li><p>Turn and Talk: “How does Cal see his own whiteness as very different from Tommy Wilson’s whiteness?” (Cal was never told he didn’t belong. Here, in the Indian school, Tommy is constantly being told he doesn’t belong.)</p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Read aloud from page 218, starting at “Tommy sits next to me,” to the bottom of page 218, ending at “as we took our seats.”</td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Read the text aloud as students follow along, reading silently.</p></li>
<li><p>Cold-call and ask: “What do you think Cal means when he writes, ‘<em>Like me</em>, I thought. <em>Right</em>.’ (He means that he realizes that, even though they both identify as Creek, he and Tommy are in very different situations.)</p></li>
<li><p>Explain that this is an example of <strong>irony</strong>—Cal means the opposite of <strong>right</strong>.</p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Read aloud page 219 in its entirety.</td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Read the text aloud as students follow along, reading silently.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “How do the students in the class seem to feel about the poetry lesson Mrs. Tygue is teaching them? What evidence supports your thinking?” (They seem very disengaged. Nobody raises their hand. Tommy has to stand, and he looks uncomfortable.)</p></li>
<li><p>Have students continue to work in pairs to discuss, then answer the following question on their note-catcher.</p></li>
<li><p>“What do the teacher’s actions in this scene reveal about her point of view toward her students? What evidence supports your thinking?” (Mrs. Tygue seems disconnected and unfeeling toward her students. She speaks to them in commands, such as “Stand up.” She refers to Cal as “New student” rather than learning his name.)</p></li>
</ul></td>

<tr class="even">
<td>Read aloud from page 220, starting at “‘The next lines’, I said” to “right after that the bugle sounded to mark the end of the hour.”</td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Read the text aloud as students follow along, reading silently.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “Cal says in his old school he was <strong>reticent</strong> to say more than a few words. What does the word <strong>reticent</strong> seem to mean? How does what you already know about Cal help you figure that out?” (It means very reluctant or unwilling. We already know from earlier chapters that Cal doesn’t talk much at all.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “Why do you think Cal speaks up here and even recites the next lines of the poem?” (Answers will vary, but may include: He has been well-educated, though the teacher seems to be skeptical of his intelligence; he is starting to feel more comfortable at the school and, therefore, feels confident enough to speak.)</p></li>
<li><p>Point out that the author, Joseph Bruchac, likely chose this particular poem by Kipling to reinforce an idea that he wanted to convey to readers. Explain the basic premise of the poem: Two men, born on different sides of a border, were originally enemies. Yet, over the course of the poem, they develop mutual respect for each other, and, in the end, a genuine friendship.</p></li>
<li><p>Turn and Talk, then answer on the note-catcher: “In your own words, restate the insight conveyed in the lines of the poem that Cal recites.” (Sample student response: A person’s race or birthplace should not be the measure by which they are judged.)</p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Read aloud page 220 (starting at “‘<em>Mu-to</em>,’ Tommy said to me”) through page 221 (ending at “kicked by a mule”).</td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Read the text aloud as students follow along, reading silently.</p></li>
<li><p>Have students continue to work in pairs to discuss, then ask: “What is happening in this section?” (Two Indian students who are friendly to Cal are asking him if he likes the white boy, Tommy.)</p></li>
<li><p>Direct students to answer the following question on their note-catcher: “Why do you think the author includes this incident?” (It shows how hard it is to be seen as a white boy in this school; it shows how aware Cal is of what it means to be Indian here, and how he fits in to the whole hierarchy.)</p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Read aloud page 221 from “It’s a big thing” to “being born who they were”</td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Read the text aloud as students follow along, reading silently.</p></li>
<li><p>Have students continue to work in pairs to discuss, then answer the following questions on their note-catcher.</p></li>
<li><p>“What does Cal realize about the Challagi school in this excerpt?” (He realizes that it’s almost as hard to be white here as it is to be Indian in the outside world.)</p></li>
<li><p>“What does he realize about his own identity?” (He is lucky not to be treated as an outsider, because he is Indian.)</p></li>
<li><p>“What does he realize about his beliefs or values?” (He believes that people shouldn’t be treated badly because of how they were born.)</p></li>
<li><p>Turn and Talk, then answer on the note-catcher: “How does the scene in which Cal recites the poem connect to Cal’s statement at the end of this excerpt?” (The poem reinforces Cal’s thinking at the end of the excerpt. Cal is realizing that one’s identity extends far beyond their race or birthplace; no one should be judged solely on the way they were born.)</p></li>

<td>Culminating Task</td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Direct them to the Culminating Task short response question on the Close Reading note-catcher.</p></li>
<li><p>Read aloud and ask: “Even though this is only an excerpt from the whole book, it seems to be pointing to several big ideas, or themes. As you know, a theme is a big idea that comes from the text but is bigger than the text. Here, an important theme is ‘Finding one’s identity often involves recognizing one’s values.’ What evidence from the text supports this theme?”</p></li>
