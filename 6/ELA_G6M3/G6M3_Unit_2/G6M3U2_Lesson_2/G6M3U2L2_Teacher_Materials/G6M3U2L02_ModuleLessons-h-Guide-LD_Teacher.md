**Sentence**

- **But it still didn’t mean that I felt good about** seeing people treated bad just for being born who they were. (from page 221 of *Two Roads* by Joseph Bruchac)

just for being born who they were.

Deconstruct: Language Goals

- **being born who they were**

“What does this chunk mean to you?” (gerund noun phrase)

- **just**

“Can you figure out what the word ‘just’ means in this chunk?” (adverb)

- Students can use an online learner’s dictionary to clarify the precise meaning of the word. If no learner’s dictionary is available, display the following definitions and invite students to select the most precise definition.

- very recently (as in, I just finished eating lunch)

- to an exact degree (as in, you look just like your brother)

- simply; nothing more than (as in, she was just a baby when her family moved to New York)

- If the answer is not yet clear to students based on this chunk, they can revisit this question during the Reconstruct section, once the entire sentence has been examined.

seeing people treated bad

Deconstruct: Language Goals

- **bad**

“What part of speech is the word ‘bad’? Is that how ‘bad’ is being used in this sentence?” (‘Bad’ is an adjective. In this sentence, however, it is functioning as an adverb because it is modifying the verb ‘treated.’)

“Why do you think the author chose to use the word ‘bad’ as an adverb in this chunk instead of using the adverb ‘badly’?” (Answers will vary, but may include: because the author wanted to show Cal’s unique use of language.)

- **seeing people treated bad**

“How does it make you feel when you see people treated badly?” (Answers will vary. \[gerund phrase\])

“How do you think Cal feels when he sees people treated badly just for being born who they were? What, in the text, makes you think so?” (Cal probably feels bad or sympathetic when he sees people treated badly just for being born who they are. The text describes Cal as a sensitive and caring character. He is likely to care about the pain of other people.)

But it still didn’t mean that I felt good about

Deconstruct: Language Goals (Focus Structure)

- **didn’t mean that**

“What does the chunk didn’t mean that tell us about what comes after it?” (It negates it; it makes it clear that what follows is not true. In this case, it indicates that Cal did not feel good about seeing people treated badly.)

- **it**

“Can you figure out what the pronoun it refers to in this chunk? You can look at the previous sentence on page 221 to help you.” (Answers will vary, but may include: Students are likely to discover that this pronoun has no clear antecedent, nor does it seem to be a non-referential pronoun that does not require an antecedent \[as seen in the sentence “It’s raining,” in which the sentence is clearly referring to weather, but “The weather is raining” would be considered grammatically odd.\])

“What if this chunk used the pronoun that or this instead of the pronoun it?” Can you figure out how the sentence might be different or clearer as a result?” (This or that is used more frequently than it to refer back to actions, ideas, or full clauses. It generally refers to objects or things.)

- Students can use an online learner’s dictionary to look up the small difference in meaning between the pronoun **it** and the pronouns **this** or **that**. Display the definitions if no learner’s dictionary is available.

- **it:** used to refer to an object, thing, or substance that was just mentioned.

- **that:** used to refer to a time, action, event, or idea that was just mentioned.

- **Students can use Conversation Cues as they discuss. To provide heavier support, display a suggested sequence, such as the one below:**

- Goal 1: I’ll give you a minute to think.

- Goal 1: So, do you mean \_\_\_\_?

- Goal 3: Why do you think that?

- Goal 4: Do you agree or disagree with what your classmate said? Why?

Practice (Focus Structure)

- On their note-catchers, students can complete the following sentences from the text with the pronoun **it** or **that**, depending on which is more appropriate. They can check their answers in the book.

The natural oils in your scalp are all you need. \_\_\_\_ is what Mom taught me. (105)

> He stops dead in his tracks, spins on his heel, and favors me with a grin so big it about splits his face. \_\_\_\_ does sort of look like a possum’s wide, tooth-baring smile. (153)

 Step 3

- To provide lighter support: “Can you explain why you chose the pronoun you did?”

- To provide heavier support: “Can you repeat what your classmate said in your own words?”

But it still didn’t mean that I felt good about seeing people treated bad just for being born who they were.

Reconstruct

- Say:

“Look at the word that in this sentence (But it still didn’t mean that . . .). Can you figure how the meaning of the first that is different from the meaning of the pronoun that, which we said could be an alternative to it?” (That as it is used here is a conjunction. It introduces a subordinate clause. In this case, it introduces an independent clause that clarifies how Cal feels.)

- Students may need a reminder of the many different meanings and grammatical functions of the word **that** in English. See Lesson 2 of the Teacher’s Guide for English Language Learners for extensions that provide lighter and heavier support for students as they interpret the multiple meanings of **that**.

“What does this sentence tell us about Cal’s point of view toward the other students at Challagi? How does this point of view connect to habits of character?” (Cal seems to have a sympathetic point of view toward other students at Challagi. He doesn’t want people to be treated badly. This connects to habits of character, like compassion and empathy.)

- Students can refer to the Determine Themes: *Two Roads* anchor chart from Lesson 1.

“In what ways does this sentence connect to a possible theme of the text? Are there any themes we should add or wording we should change on the anchor chart?” (Answers will vary, but may include: Students may notice connections to possible themes like, ‘Respect all you encounter—people and nature both’ or ‘Our peers can affirm or threaten or identities.’)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Answers will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the module guiding question, What factors influence our identities?” (Answers will vary, but may include: the sentence in this Language Dive suggests that seeing how other people are treated based on their identities may change how we feel about our own.)

Practice (Sentence)

- Cal \_\_\_\_\_\_, but \_\_\_\_\_\_ \[**it/that**\] still didn’t mean that he \_\_\_\_\_\_. (Cal agreed to go to Challagi, but that still didn’t mean that he felt good about being away from Pop.)  Step 4

- To provide lighter support: Encourage students to adapt this frame and use it to support their answer to the prompt of the QuickWrite during Closing and Assessment A, “How are Cal’s attitudes toward race and ethnicity changing at Challagi?” Because the prompt is written in the present tense, the response should also be written in the present tense; invite students to rewrite the frame using present-tense verbs (e.g., Cal is \[verb + **-ing**\], but that still doesn’t mean that he \_\_\_\_\_ ).

- To provide heavier support: “What is different about this frame and the structure of the original sentence? Why do you think we are practicing with a frame that doesn’t begin at the word **but**?”

Language Chunk Wall Suggestions

- Language to connect words, phrases, clauses: **<u>But</u> it still didn’t mean <u>that</u> I felt good about**

- Language to emphasize: **But it <u>still</u> didn’t mean that I felt good about; <u>just</u> for being born who they were.**

- Adverbs and adverbial phrases and clauses: **seeing people treated <u>bad</u>/badly**
