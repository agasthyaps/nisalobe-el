Homework: Race and Ethnicity

(Example for Teacher Reference)

Race and ethnicity are complex terms and, because they can be difficult to define, often get used interchangeably. Read the following definitions from the American Sociological Association:

“Race refers to one’s biology, or physical characteristics.

Ethnicity refers to one’s cultural practices, such as language and beliefs.”

Add **race** and **ethnicity** to your vocabulary log. Keep these distinctions in mind as you respond to the prompt below.

How are Cal’s understanding and point of view toward race and ethnicity changing as a result of his experiences at Challagi? (RL.6.1, RL.6.3, RL.6.6, W.6.10)

Refer to your Analyze Character: *Two Roads* note-catcher, Point of View note-catcher, and copy of *Two Roads*, as needed.

Answers will vary, but may include: At first, Cal had a stereotypical perception of Indians. He thought of them as one large group of people with the same appearance and the same culture. Since he has been at Challagi, he is realizing that race and ethnicity are complicated. There are Indians with different skin tones and different cultural practices. Some students are on a tribal roll and speak their tribal language but have light skin. Cal has darker skin and is half-Indian but never learned about his American Indian heritage until he came to Challagi. Cal is also realizing that race and ethnicity are associated with power. Because he has lighter skin, he thought of himself as white, which he calls a “luxury.” Being white, he says, “means not worrying about who you are” (218). Now that he is learning about his American Indian ethnicity, his identity is in question and is starting to shift.
