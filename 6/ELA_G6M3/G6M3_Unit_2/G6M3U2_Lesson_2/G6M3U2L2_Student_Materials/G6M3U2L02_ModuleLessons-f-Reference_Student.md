**Chapter 21, “Expecting Indians”**

- Cal reflects on his expectations of the type of Indians he would see at Challagi versus the reality of the population of students at the school.

- Tommy Wilson considers himself Muskogee Creek like Cal, but Tommy is blond haired and blue eyed, so others do not accept Tommy.

- Cal thinks about how teachers treat the students at Challagi. A few teachers, like Mrs. Tygue, are good teachers. Other teachers, like the math teacher Mr. Pond, are degrading and insulting to the students. The students do not learn much in those classes.

- Cal thinks of how students are treated by some of the adults at Challagi, and Cal considers running away. The only thing that keeps Cal at school is that he does not want to disappoint Pop.

- Cal recognizes that some guys in his gang, like Bear Meat, are very judgmental and not accepting of students who are either too fair-skinned or too dark-skinned.

- Cal acknowledges that he does not like how others are treated so differently.

- Cal recognizes the segregation in the mess hall because the students who are too dark, the *staluskey*, all sit together at tables separate from the other students.
