Grade 6: Module 3: Unit 2: Lesson 1

Lesson Overview

Lesson Summary

Students answer questions on their Analyze Character: *Two Roads* note-catchers about Cal’s responses to challenges in chapters 18 and 20. Students work together to differentiate between topic and theme and determine key themes in the text. Students use text-based evidence from *Two Roads* to support a given theme and explain how a given theme is illustrated in the text.

Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- L.6.5c – Opening A: Students use dictionaries to determine the denotation and connotations of words from the text.

- RL.6.1 – Work Time A: Students use evidence from chapters 18 and 20 to answer questions on their Analyze Character: *Two Roads* note-catchers.

- RL.6.3 – Work Time A: Students answer questions on their Analyze Character: *Two Roads* note-catchers about Cal’s responses to challenges in chapters 18 and 20.

- RL.6.2 – Work Time B: Students work together to differentiate between topic and theme and determine key themes in the text.

- RL.6.1 – Closing and Assessment A: Students complete an exit ticket, in which they use text-based evidence from *Two Roads* to support a given theme.

- RL.6.2 – Closing and Assessment A: Students explain how a given theme is illustrated in *Two Roads*.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Chapter 19 of *Two Roads* is not read in class due to time constraints, and is not required reading for this unit. Encourage students to read this chapter independently and share a summary with their classmates, with a special emphasis on how the chapter reveals character development and point of view.

- To support students’ understanding of theme, display a common and easily understood theme that can be found in multiple movies, books, or video games. Ask students to think of as many movies, books, or games as possible that reflect that theme in their story. For an added challenge, invite students to think of particular pieces of evidence (e.g., famous lines of dialogue, key plot changes) that reflect that theme. This activity may be especially valuable for ELLs, as the example themes can serve as models that help students to differentiate theme from topic. ▲ Some themes that could be used in this activity are *“love conquers all”* or *“be careful what you wish for.”*

- Students with a strong understanding of theme can be invited to create a soundtrack for a hypothetical movie version of *Two Roads*, choosing songs with themes that are portrayed in the novel.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous unit, students began an initial introduction to the anchor text, while supplementing their reading with primary source texts to provide background on the historical setting of the novel. In this unit, students finish reading the anchor text, synthesizing their learning from the informational texts and primary source images to identify overarching themes and answer the module guiding questions.

- Theme was introduced in Module 1, during which students were taught to distinguish theme from main idea. In this lesson, students build on that understanding to craft sophisticated theme statements that capture the mature themes present in this narrative, *Two Roads*.

Support All Students

- Note that there is a differentiated version of the Exit Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 1 used in Closing and Assessment A in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Many of the primary themes in *Two Roads* center around issues of identity construction, relating to one of the module’s guiding questions, *What factors influence our identities?* There are many opportunities for engagement as students process these themes in light of their own lives, experiences, and identities. Support students by encouraging them to identify and explore personal connections to the text’s themes, but without requiring that students publicly report the connections they uncover (i.e., in a whole-group setting) if it makes students uncomfortable to do so.

- In Chapter 18, Cal continues to interpret situations around him in relation to his own identity: “ . . . how long will it last when folks find out who I really am? Which is what? An Indian passing for white? A white boy who now has to be an Indian? It makes my head hurt” (195). Consider inviting students to make general observations on the chapter, allowing space for comments on identity to arise organically.

- Chapters 19 and 20 mention some of the topics explored in the supplemental texts of Unit 1. These include references to low-quality food (203), child labor (205), and Captain Pratt’s speech (214). Support students’ learning by helping them integrate information across texts. For developing readers, more explicit connections may be helpful (e.g., “What did the Meriam Report say about the conditions at American Indian boarding schools? What does chapter 20 say?”) ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson builds upon students’ understanding of theme, a concept to which they were first introduced during Module 1. This lesson reinforces learning around theme by providing opportunities for students to review ideas first presented in earlier modules (e.g., distinctions between theme and topic; strategies for inferring theme) and apply them to the Module 3 anchor text, *Two Roads*. Think-Pair-Share protocols are built into the discussion of theme, facilitating collaboration and accommodating different needs in processing time.

- ELLs may find it challenging to generate their own theme statements, even if they are able to correctly differentiate theme from topic. Remind them that the purpose of this lesson is to continue developing the theme-related skills that will support independent work in the future. There will be many opportunities before the mid-unit assessment to practice identifying themes and supporting them with text-based evidence.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.B.6 and 6.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- A number of themes, major and minor, can be identified in *Two Roads*. Guide students towards the most powerful theme statements, especially those that answer the module guiding questions. Ensure that students are choosing themes that are not specific only to this text, but rather suggest a universal truth or insight about the human condition.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will engage in a close read of chapter 21 of *Two Roads* to analyze a text excerpt for how it shows a particular theme. Students will also use this excerpt to continue their analysis of how Cal changes in response to his experiences. The close read is followed by a Language Dive that presents Cal’s developing awareness of and conflicting attitudes toward race and identity.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Preread chapters 18 and 20 of *Two Roads* to identify potentially challenging vocabulary or plot points. Note that students read up to page 189 during the End of Unit 1 Assessment. They pick up the reading of chapter 18 starting on page 194 (“‘You know what that was?’”). Chapter 19 is not read in class due to time constraints.

- Prepare the Determine Themes: *Two Roads* anchor chart. Identify several potential themes in the anchor text, focusing mainly on major themes.

- Review the new materials used in this lesson to ensure clarity about what students will need to know and be able to do.

- Prepare copies of handouts for students (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.6.5c (25 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 1**. Students will also need their **affix lists** and access to a **print or online dictionary**. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 1 (example for teacher reference)** for possible responses.

- Add the words *humorless* and *chuckle* to the **academic word wall** as students add these words to their **vocabulary logs**.

- Using a total participation technique, ask:

“How can a character chuckle humorlessly? What might this reveal about the way the character is responding to an event?” (The chuckle may be more sarcastic rather than a response to something truly funny. The character may be laughing in an ironic way or a way that shows he is trying to make light of a more serious situation.)

“Reread the context in which the phrase ‘humorless chuckle’ is used. What is Possum explaining when he emits a humorless chuckle?” (Possum is talking about the hard labor expected of Challagi students when he gives the humorless chuckle. He is describing how neat and tidy the vast grounds of the school are as a result of the students’ work. He is explaining the harsh punishment that will result if students do not complete the difficult chores.)

“Considering the context, how does Possum’s reaction with a humorless chuckle reveal something about his character?” (Possum seems to be light-hearted and optimistic. Even when talking about something serious, he has a somewhat positive or playful reaction.)

- Invite students to demonstrate or act out a humorless chuckle.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar to or the same as previous lessons. Invite students to choose a habit of character focus for themselves for this lesson.

Work Time

A. Read *Two Roads*, Chapters 18 and 20 – RL.6.3 (25 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Read ***Two Roads*** through the end of chapter 18 starting on page 194 (“‘You know what that was?’”). Read chapter 20 of the text in its entirety. Use **Text Guide: *Two Roads*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students who are ready to read independently or in small groups should be released to this independence. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Students continue to identify how characters in the text demonstrate habits of character. Refer to the **Gist anchor chart: *Two Roads*** **(example for teacher reference)** and **chapter synopsis** as needed, as well as any other appropriate resources.

- Gist of chapter 18: Cal meets Skinny who gives him his school uniforms. Cal is approached by a gang of boys who pick a fight with him. The fight is broken up but they don’t tattle on each other; Cal is accepted into the group.

- Gist of chapter 20: Cal is starting to learn the ways of the school—getting up early, cleaning the latrines, and obeying orders. Cal is invited to join the track team.

- Return to the conclusion of chapter 18, and ask students to retrieve their **Analyze Character: *Two Roads*** **note-catcher**. Focus students on the final scene of the chapter in which Bear Meat and Cal stand off and then are confronted by the disciplinarian. Direct students to complete the row for chapter 18 on their note-catcher using evidence from this scene.

- Using a total participation technique, invite students to share their responses. Refer to the **Analyze Character: *Two Roads*** **(example for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

B. Determine Themes – RL.6.2 (10 minutes)

- Explain that now that we have read a large portion of the text, *Two Roads*, and have become more familiar with the setting and characters, themes are starting to emerge. Remind students that they were first introduced to the concept of theme in Module 1 when they identified themes present in *The Lightning Thief*. Refer to the **Determine Themes: *The Lightning Thief*** **anchor chart**, as needed.

- Remind students that, in narrative texts, a theme is different than a topic. A topic is a subject or issue that may come up in the text. The theme is the observation or statement the author is making about that topic.

- Display the **Determine Themes: *Two Roads*** **anchor chart**. Add this distinction between topic and theme to the anchor chart, as well as a brief definition of theme. Refer to the **Determine Themes: *Two Roads*** **anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What topics, or issues, have come up repeatedly in *Two Roads* so far?” (Answers will vary, but may include: race, identity, the Great Depression, American Indian boarding schools, friendship, family, the Hobo Code)

- Record significant topics on the Determine Themes: *Two Roads* anchor chart.

- Direct students to retrieve their **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 14**. Think-Pair-Share:

“What messages or lessons about these topics does the author offer the reader through the text?” Refer to the Determine Themes: *Two Roads* anchor chart (example for teacher reference) for possible responses.

- Point out that topics differ from themes because a topic is a single concept; a theme is a full statement that contains an opinion or insight. Remind students that to test whether the themes they have generated so far are present in *Two Roads*, they would have to be supported by text evidence.

- Explain that, usually, a theme is not stated outright in a text; most often, the reader has to infer the theme from text details. Create a table on the anchor chart with three sections: topic, emerging theme, and text evidence.

- Remind students that in the early chapters of the text, the author establishes Cal often demonstrates respectful behavior. Point out that respect is a topic, and add this to the table in the topic section on the anchor chart.

- Ask:

“How do we know this is a topic and not a theme?” (It is not a complete statement containing an opinion, only a single word.)

- Instruct students to open *Two Roads* to page 14. Read aloud as students read silently.

- Read from page 14, “He gestures down the road . . . ” to page 16, “I do my best to live by it.”

- Think-Pair-Share:

“A theme is revealed through text details. What text-based evidence can we find that addresses the topic *respect*?” (Answers will vary, but may include: Pop and Cal follow the Hobo’s Code, a standard of ethical behavior followed by true knights of the road. Pop and Cal always work for their meals or lodging; they never steal. Cal cleans up before eating; he washes up at the pump and combs his hair. Pop and Cal speak politely, saying “Thank you kindly, ma’am.”)

- Add these responses to the *text evidence* section of the anchor chart.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What message or lesson about *respect* does the author convey through these text details?” (Answers will vary, but may include: Respect and good manners will get you farther in life than selfishness.)

- Add these responses to the *emerging* *theme* section of the anchor chart.

Closing and Assessment

A. Exit Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 1 – RL.6.2 (5 minutes)

- Distribute **Exit Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 1** or **Exit Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 1** ▲. Read the directions aloud and clarify any questions.

- Direct students to begin.

- With one minute remaining, refocus students and collect the exit tickets to review later for misconceptions. Refer to **Exit Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 1 (example for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their habit of character focus for this lesson.

For Lighter Support

- For an added challenge during Closing and Assessment A, invite students who need lighter support to select a second theme recorded on the Determine Theme: *Two Roads* anchor chart and locate additional text-based evidence to support that theme on their Exit Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 1.

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from chapter 21 of *Two Roads*. Consider providing ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Invite students who need lighter support to choose one of the following tasks to complete in preparation for the Language Dive. Students can then be invited to share their work before the Language Dive.

- Paraphrase the sentence using your own words.

- Generate three questions that could be asked about the sentence during a Language Dive.

- Underline all pronouns, check all nouns, circle all verbs, and star all adjectives. What words do you have left? What are the functions of these words?

For Heavier Support

- During Closing and Assessment A, invite students who need heavier support to use the Exit Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 1 ▲. This resource features sentence frames that guide students toward the actions of particular characters in the text, reducing the cognitive demands of the task.

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from chapter 21 of *Two Roads*. Consider providing ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Invite students who need heavier support to choose one of the following tasks to complete in preparation for the Language Dive.

- Make a guess about what the “chunks” of the sentence might be.

- Use a dictionary to look up the word *treated* and select the best definition for the word as it is used in this sentence.

- Write a question to ask Cal about his thoughts in this sentence.

Homework

A. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread chapter 21 in *Two Roads* in preparation for studying this chapter in the next lesson.
