Synopsis: *Two Roads*, Chapters 18–20

**Name:** **Date:**

**Chapter 18, “New Duds”**

- Possum and Cal watch Pop walk away.

- As Cal and Possum walk through the school grounds, other students greet Possum but do not say anything to Cal. He is relieved.

- Cal has thoughts of doubt: Is Possum really his friend? How will he get along without Pop to guide him and be by his side?

- During the walk, Cal sees a building that is strikingly different from the other buildings. Possum tells Cal that no one goes near the building anymore. The old guardhouse is no longer used to lock up a student when he breaks a rule.

- Cal is mentally transported into the guardhouse. Possum says that his aunt had the same ability.

- Possum confides that his scar on his face came from getting slapped by somebody with a ring.

- Possum and Cal reach the tailor shop. Cal is introduced to Skinny, who provides Cal with a uniform.

- Skinny does a handshake with Cal, and Cal picks up the moves quickly. It is the Challagi Creek Handshake. The handshake means that a person has been accepted into the group.

- Cal is confronted by Bear Meat, who is the leader of a gang. Bear Meat asks Cal to empty his pockets, then tells Cal he is going to wrestle him for Cal’s jack knife.

- The head disciplinarian arrives and demands to know what happened. Cal refuses to tell on Bear Meat. Bear Meat tells Cal to keep the knife and invites Cal to sit at their table at mealtime.

**Chapter 19, “Mess”**

- Possum explains the rules of mess.

- Cal notices how the girls and boys are separated during mealtime as well.

- Cal also notices how the staff tables seem better than the student tables. The staff get gleaming utensils and glassware, while the students get dull utensils and mugs.

- The food is delivered to the table, and everyone rushes to fill their plates.

- Cal eats and looks around the table at his new gang. His being accepted into the gang makes him feel less abandoned and lonely.

**Chapter 20, “In Step”**

- Cal wakes up confused. He does not realize where he is, but then the reality of being at Challagi Indian Industrial School hits him.

- Cal hops out of bed, fully clothed in his uniform, and joins the rest of House Four.

- Ray Chapman, the company sergeant, marches the guys of House Four about half a mile from the dorm. The bugle sounds and the boys have to hustle in order to make it back to the dorm, change, and report to class or work on time.

- Cal uses the opportunity to run at full speed. He shocks Ray with his speed. Back at the dorm, Ray tells Cal that he should join the track team.
