Why were American Indian boarding schools first established?

- *American Indian boarding schools were established to assimilate Native Americans into white American culture through education and erasure of Native American identity.*

What kinds of experiences did students have at American Indian boarding schools? How did these experiences impact students?

- *Students may have experienced forced aesthetic changes (e.g., their hair was cut and their clothes were changed), linguistic changes (e.g., they were not allowed to use their Native American languages), and identity changes (e.g., their names were changed).*

- *Students may have experienced abuses or cruelty at the hands of the school’s administration.*

- *Students may have formed strong bonds with other students and exchanged tribal knowledge that actually strengthened their ties to their heritage (e.g., stomp dances, sweat lodges, language, oral tradition).*

What factors influence our identities?

- *Our peers, our school, our families, and our experiences can affirm or threaten our identities.*

- *Identities are dynamic and change in response to experience, awareness, and self-reflection.*

- *Identities are complicated and conflicting, and tensions may exist among our different identities.*

What will your student be doing at school?

In Unit 2, students read the anchor text *Two Roads* for various purposes. In the first part of the unit, they use the anchor text as a resource for building their knowledge of grammar. Sentences from the text are used to practice recognizing and using pronouns in their correct forms. Understanding the nuances of language can help students to better appreciate well-written sentences and texts and to develop their academic writing skills. Understanding sentence structure is also important as students practice varying their sentences to write in ways that are more compelling and vivid for their audience. Students will incorporate several strategies into their writing to add variety, such as combining shorter sentences, using conjunctions to connect ideas, adding figurative language, and using interjections for a pop of excitement. Expressing oneself clearly and concisely is essential in academic and professional work, as well as in personal communications.

The protagonists of *Two Roads* often communicate via personal letters. Students demonstrate their comprehension of the text and use their new skills of varying sentence patterns and using vibrant words in sentences, such as descriptive adjectives and action-packed verbs, to write a narrative letter. As the novel comes to a close, students embody Cal’s perspective to consider a crucial question: Should he return to Challagi Indian Industrial School or should he stay with Pop? Students practice gathering evidence to support two sides of the question. They analyze a model argument for effective writing techniques, then write their own, taking the opposite position. The language of the letter will be assessed for correct pronoun use and sentence variety, while the content will be used to help students prepare their evidence and reasoning for an argument essay to be written in Unit 3.

Central to the EL Education curriculum is a focus on “habits of character” and social-emotional learning. Students work to become effective learners, developing mindsets and skills for success in college, career, and life (e.g., initiative, responsibility, perseverance, collaboration); work to become ethical people, treating others well and standing up for what is right (e.g., empathy, integrity, respect, compassion); and work to contribute to a better world, putting their learning to use to improve communities (e.g., citizenship, service).

In this unit, students work to become effective learners by showing responsibility with on-time completion of reading tasks. They also demonstrate perseverance as they navigate the sometimes tricky details of aligning pronouns with their proper case, number, and person. Collaboration is key during the Final Word protocol, which is utilized several times in this module as students make meaning of complex texts. Students work to become ethical people by showing empathy toward those who suffered as a result of their experiences in the American Indian boarding schools. They show compassion and respect towards their classmates as the text brings up personal connections and reflections that may be difficult for others to share.

How can you support your student at home?

Read articles with your student that incorporate graphics or photographs. Talk to your student about the connection between the article and the visual element. Ask your student what further information about the article topic he/she can learn from the visual element.

Read versions of the same story that offer different points of view. Talk to your student about how the story changes based on the point of view from which the story is told.

Read the anchor text with your student. Occasionally, ask your student to retell the events of a chapter you’ve read together.

Talk to your student about his/her favorite character from a book, graphic novel, television show, or movie. Ask your student what attributes of that character make the character his/her favorite.

Write stories with your student. Use vivid adjectives and exciting verbs to spice up the sentences in your stories.

Make a vocal recording of the stories you’ve written with your student.

Talk to your student about his/her favorite book, graphic novel, television show, or movie. Ask your student what messages, lessons, or insights the text, show, or movie is trying to express to the audience.

Unit 2: Homework

Student homework in Unit 2 will provide practice in summary writing; identifying and correcting pronoun case, person, and number; point of view analysis; gathering evidence for an argument; and sentence variety. Students will also complete reading assignments in the anchor text, as well as their independent research reading text.

**Anchor Text reading:** Time limitations do not always allow for students to read entire chapters of *Two Roads* to be read during class; therefore, students should preread a chapter for homework the night before it is studied in class. Reading from the anchor text will be balanced with independent research reading, which is used to deepen students’ background knowledge about the topic of the module.

**Research reading:** Your student is expected to independently research the topic of study in this module, American Indian boarding schools, by reading topic-related books of his or her choice. Research reading will be assigned on evenings when students are not already reading the anchor text. Students will be expected to read for approximately 20 minutes each day and respond to a prompt of choice in the front of the independent reading journal.

**Choice reading:** If your student would also like to independently read and respond to a book of free choice, he or she may use the back of the independent reading journal.

Independent Reading

**Directions:** Remember to record responses to research reading in the front of your independent reading journal and responses to choice reading in the back. Try to choose a different prompt each time.

Record any new vocabulary in your vocabulary log. Underline vocabulary found during independent reading.

Record:

- Date

- Title and author of your reading book

- Pages you have read

- Prompt

- Response

Example:

<u>Date:</u> February 10

<u>Book Title and Author:</u> *Two Roads* by Joseph Bruchac

<u>Pages Read:</u> 217–226

<u>Prompt:</u> Explain a way in which you connect to the text.

<u>Response:</u> In chapter 21, Cal really struggles with his identity. He explains that the students at the school have all varying degrees of Indian blood. Some look more “traditionally” Indian and others have lighter skin or hair because of their “mixed-blood.” Cal struggles to figure out where he belongs, as he grew up thinking of himself as white, but now being proud to identify as part-Indian. In fact, at school, it’s a benefit to be more Indian, whereas, outside of the school, it’s better to be viewed as white. This adds another layer of confusion as Cal undergoes his identity crisis. I could really relate to Cal’s struggle here. Now that I am getting so close to going to high school, I feel like I can create a new persona for myself. In high school, I will have a fresh start and a blank slate. This could be the time to establish a completely new identity for myself. Do I want to keep my old silly nickname, or use my full name to sound more sophisticated? Do I want to try out for a team or join a club? Am I ride-or-die with my current friends, or is it time to start branching out more socially? Cal has shown me that identities can be fluid; they evolve over time. We might tap more into one part of our identity, depending on our circumstances.

(Note: The example above uses *Two Roads* as the text in mention. The event mentioned in the example is from a section of the novel students do not read. Students will not be using the anchor text for their journal entries; students will respond to the writing prompts based on their chosen independent research text.)

Consider using the following independent reading prompts.[^1]

- How does this text add to your understanding of one of the Guiding Questions of the module?

- Which habits of character are demonstrated in the text? Explain.

- Which habits of character are NOT demonstrated in the text? Explain.

- Record two or three facts in your own words that you learned from the text.

- Summarize your research reading today in no more than five sentences.

- Explain a way in which you connect to the text.

- Explain how the text connects to another text you’ve read.

- Explain how the text connects to something currently happening in the world.

- Explain how the text connects to *Two Roads*.

- Explain how the text relates to the topic of American Indian boarding schools.

- Explain how the text relates to historical context across time periods and/or different events in history.

- Explain how excerpts from the text represent accurate historical context.

- Choose one new word from your reading today and analyze it on a vocabulary square.

| **Definition in your own words**                  | **Synonyms** (words with the same meaning) |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Words with the same affix or root**             | **Sketch**                                 |
| **Translation in home language** (if appropriate) |                                            |

Vocabulary

**Directions:** In the classroom, you have been recording words from your texts in your vocabulary log. Throughout this unit, you have been research reading topic-related books at home to build your knowledge of critical problems and design solutions and recording words in your independent reading journal.

Choose a word from your research reading or from a text you’ve read in class, and add the word to your vocabulary log. Try to choose a different word to add and to practice a different vocabulary strategy each time. For each word, be sure to add the following:

1.  The definition, or meaning, of the word

<!-- -->

3.  The vocabulary strategy you used to figure out the meaning of the word

4.  A sketch or diagram that helps you to better understand the meaning of the word

Record new vocabulary in vocabulary logs and mark academic vocabulary with a symbol—for example, a star:

- Academic vocabulary: words you might find in informational texts on many different topics. For example, the words evidence and rationale are words that could be found in books on any topic.

- Domain-specific vocabulary: words about a particular topic. For example, the words *tadpoles*, *frogspawn*, and *amphibians* are some that would be found on the topic of frogs.

**Vocabulary Strategies**

As a reminder, the vocabulary strategies we’ve been working on in class are:

- Context: Read the sentence around the word.

- Look at the affixes for clues.

- Look at the root of the word for clues.

- Use a dictionary.

- Discuss the word with another person (after attempting some of the above strategies).

[^1]: Some of the prompts will not be appropriate for the text students are reading. Invite students to choose a prompt that works for the text they have just read.
