Determine Themes: *The Lightning Thief*  
Anchor Chart

The **themes** of a text are the statements or observations that an author is making about life or the “real world” through the text. It is a message rooted in the text and evident throughout a text, but relevant to a broader audience. There is often more than one theme in a text.

Authors develop themes with pieces of evidence that support the theme called **key details**. Often, the author reveals their message through key details such as repeated ideas or concepts, a conflict or change a character experiences and learns from, or advice offered by wise characters in the text. As you read a text, think about the real-world message the author wants you to understand and take away from the text, and gather details to confirm your original thinking about the theme(s).
