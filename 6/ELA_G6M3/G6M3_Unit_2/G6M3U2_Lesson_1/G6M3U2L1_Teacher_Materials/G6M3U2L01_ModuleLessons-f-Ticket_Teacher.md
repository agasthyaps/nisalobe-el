**Directions:** Consider the following theme from *Two Roads*. Record one piece of text-based evidence that supports the given theme. Explain your choice by connecting it to the theme statement. Remember that the theme can be revealed by any character’s actions or words, not just those of the protagonist.

Theme: Help others whenever and wherever needed; you may need their help one day.

Sample student response: On page 200 of *Two Roads*, Cal helps Bear Meat by keeping him out of trouble. Cal doesn’t tattle on Bear Meat for starting a fight with him, even though the head disciplinarian gives him a chance to get Bear Meat in trouble. As a result, Bear Meat welcomes Cal into the gang and makes Cal feel accepted. By helping Bear Meat, Bear Meat returns the favor, and Cal’s situation at Challagi improves. This scene shows the theme because Cal offered help to Bear Meat and then later, Bear Meat helped Cal.
