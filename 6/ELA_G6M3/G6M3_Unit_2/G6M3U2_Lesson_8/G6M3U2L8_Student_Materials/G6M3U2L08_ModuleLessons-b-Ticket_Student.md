Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 8

L.6.3a

**Name:** **Date:**

**Directions:** As you enter class, read the learning targets. Then read this excerpt adapted from page 285 of *Two Roads*.

“The moonlight shines on the field. The scent of the prairie grasses is kicked up by Dakota’s hooves. The warm night wind hits my face. I can feel the horse’s strong, muscular body beneath me. It is almost like a dream.”

Rewrite these simple sentences, combining them into one complex sentence. You may remove or add words, change a word’s part of speech, and insert punctuation. Do not, however, change the meaning of the sentence.
