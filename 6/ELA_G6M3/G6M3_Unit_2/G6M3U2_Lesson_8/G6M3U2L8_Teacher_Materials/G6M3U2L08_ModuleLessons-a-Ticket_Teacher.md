**Directions:** As you enter class, read the learning targets. Then read this excerpt adapted from page 285 of *Two Roads*.

“The moonlight shines on the field. The scent of the prairie grasses is kicked up by Dakota’s hooves. The warm night wind hits my face. I can feel the horse’s strong, muscular body beneath me. It is almost like a dream.”

Rewrite these simple sentences, combining them into one complex sentence. You may remove or add words, change a word’s part of speech, and insert punctuation. Do not, however, change the meaning of the sentence.

Answers will vary, but may include: The moonlight shining on the field, the scent of the prairie grasses being kicked up by Dakota’s hooves, the warm night wind in my face, and the feel of the horse’s strong, muscular body beneath me is almost like a dream.
