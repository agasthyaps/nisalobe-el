**Steps to Success:**

- Identify the subject and highlight it in blue.

- Identify the predicate and highlight it in red.

- Identify the pronoun and highlight it in green.

- Figure out the pronoun’s job in the sentence (subject, predicate pronoun, direct object, indirect object, object of the preposition, or possessive pronoun).

- Check the pronoun case chart to determine if the pronoun is subjective case, objective case, or possessive case.

- If the pronoun usage is correct, write **Yes**. If not, write **No**, and rewrite the sentence with the correct pronoun.
