**Chapter 27, “Time to Go”**

- Cal approaches the fire at the gang’s camp. He notices the fire is much larger than usual, and they have constructed some type of rounded hut.

- Deacon and Cal enter the lodge. Deacon performs a ceremony that is meant to cleanse Cal’s words, as well as his body.

- Little Coon, Possum, Deacon, and Cal sit next to the fire. Deacon asks Cal to share his dream.

- Cal speaks at length about what he saw and experienced in the dream.

- When Cal questions the possibility of his dream vision happening, Deacon informs Cal that the vision may be letting Cal know “what might happen, not what has to happen.”

- Cal understands that he is the only person who can change the outcome of the vision.

- Possum and Cal quietly sneak to the stables the next night. Little Coon is the lookout.

- Cal is at a loss for words to say to Possum, but Possum assures Cal they will be “meeting up again one way or another down the road.”

- Cal leads Dakota, the pinto horse, from its stall. Cal then places a bridle in Dakota’s mouth. Cal mounts the horse and rides off across the school’s northern prairie.
