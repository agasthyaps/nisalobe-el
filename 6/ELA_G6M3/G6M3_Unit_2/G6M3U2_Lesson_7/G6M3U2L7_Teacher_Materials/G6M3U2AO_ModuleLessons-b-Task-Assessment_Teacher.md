**Directions:** Read chapter 27 in *Two Roads*, and answer the following questions.

1.  **Part A**

How does Cal respond to the sweat lodge ceremony? (RL.6.3)

2.  He becomes overwhelmed and self-conscious afterward.

3.  He thinks the ceremony won’t do anything to help.

4.  <u>He feels relieved and energized after the ceremony.</u>

5.  He is resistant to doing the ceremony with Deacon.

**Part B**

Write two pieces of evidence from the text that support your answer in Part A. (RL.6.1)

“Every inch of my skin feels as if it’s on fire, yet it also feels cleansed at the same time” (280).

“When I stand up again, the air feels cool on my body and all of my senses seem more alive than I can ever remember them feeling” (281).

6.  Complete the paragraph planner to explain how Cal’s point of view toward his visions changes as a result of the events in this chapter. Use evidence from the chapter to support your ideas. (RL.6.1, RL.6.3, RL.6.6, W.6.10)

**Part A**

Write a topic sentence that includes key words from the question (How does Cal respond to the sweat lodge ceremony?) and includes the chapter and text you are analyzing.

In chapter 27 of *Two Roads* by Joseph Bruchac, Cal’s point of view toward his visions changes.

**Part B**

Answer the question: How does Cal respond to the sweat lodge ceremony?

Cal’s experience in the sweat lodge changes how he feels about his visions. Before this chapter, Cal is still unsure about his visions. He knows Possum hinted that he knew others who had them, but he still hasn’t shared any details with him.

After the sweat lodge ceremony, Cal realizes that his friends believe him. They also understand and honor his visions.

**Part C**

Cite evidence from the text to support your response.

Cal says to himself, “I’ve never told anyone about my visions before. But being in the presence of friends who understand, who don’t think such things are crazy, who even have names for the kind of seeing I’ve been experiencing makes all the difference” (281).

Deacon also helps Cal to see that there is hope, and that the visions can just be warnings and “Not what has to happen” (282).

Cal reflects, “When I’m done I actually feel a little better, as if some of the weight’s been lifted. But it’s also made that vision stronger” (282).

**Part D**

Explain your answer. What does this help the reader to understand?

As a result of the events in this chapter, Cal feels more confident about and relieved toward his visions and his ability to change the events he saw about his father. This helps the reader to understand that Cal is now confident enough to leave Challagi because of what he learned in his vision.

7.  Write a summary of chapter 27. Remember, a summary should include: an introduction stating the title, a brief outline of what the text is about, a possible theme, details from the text to support your theme, and no opinions or judgments. (RL.6.1, RL.6.2, W.6.10)

In chapter 27 of *Two Roads*, Cal experiences his first sweat lodge and makes an important decision. The first part of the chapter describes what Deacon and the rest of the boys did to prepare to make the special ceremony for Cal. It also describes how Deacon led Cal through the ceremony inside the lodge. The second part of the chapter explains how Cal leaves that night to find Pop in Washington. Because of what happens in this chapter, Cal feels closely bonded with his Creek brothers, close enough to share his visions. The author writes, “As the four of us sit by the fire after the sweat, I know they are all feeling what I’m feeling. We are truly Brothers. Whatever happens from here on in we’ll always be as close as kin” (281). Deacon, Possum, and Little Coon are understanding and supportive, and they encourage and help him to leave the school to find Pop. This chapter seems to convey the theme that our friends can support us and help us as we try to uncover and understand our changing identities.
