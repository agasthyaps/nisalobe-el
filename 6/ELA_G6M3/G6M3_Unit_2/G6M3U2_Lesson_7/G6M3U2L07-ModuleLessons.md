Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Work Time A: Students complete the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment. They read chapter 27 of *Two Roads* and answer selected response and short constructed response questions about how Cal responds and his point of view changes as a result of the events in the chapter. Students then write a summary of the chapter that includes discussion of a possible theme of the text. (RL.6.1, RL.6.2, RL.6.3, RL.6.6, RL.6.10)

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners by reading and answering questions independently for the mid-unit assessment. Prompt students’ perseverance by reminding them that assessments are meant to inform instruction. Use assessment data to make choices about what should be retaught and how to adjust the pacing. Encourage students not to be afraid of mistakes; an accurate assessment is crucial for tailoring lessons to students’ needs.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Some students may not need extensive review of the assessment directions. Release them to begin working on the assessment while clarification is provided to other students who need more support.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the second half of this unit, students read several more chapters of *Two Roads*, analyzing point of view, character, and plot development, as well as central idea and emerging themes of the novel. This lesson continues those routines in an assessment, asking students to apply their learning to a new chapter of *Two Roads*.

- Students were introduced to pronoun cases in Unit 2, Lesson 4. They continue practicing Language standards with a pronoun review for homework.

Support All Students

- In chapter 27, Cal participates in a sweat lodge ceremony for the first time. It is likely that students have not heard of sweat lodges or a sweat lodge ceremony before. A sweat lodge ceremony is a ritual for religious purification and spiritual renewal. Consider supplementing the mid-unit assessment with a short blurb explaining what a sweat lodge is and the role it may play in some American Indian communities:

“Sweat lodges are heated dome-shaped structures used by Indigenous peoples during certain purification rites and as a way to promote healthy living. The intense heat generated — often by steam created from pouring water onto heated rocks — is meant to encourage a sweating out of toxins and negative energy that create disorder and imbalance in life. In this way, the sweat lodge ceremony cleanses the body, mind and soul . . . For Indigenous peoples, the sweat lodge has spiritual, cultural, and practical purposes. It is a place to connect with the Creator and to nature, and restore order and balance in life. The sweat lodge is also a place to connect with Indigenous heritage and culture . . . The lodge therefore serves as a symbol of cultural resilience and resurgence. Sweats also have healing functions, which, for some individuals, have been significant parts of their journey towards recovery and overall good health.”

- As with any assessment, students may feel nervous to read new passages independently and answer questions about them. Point out all the preparation they have had through activities, homework, and in-class reading time. Also, remind them there will be other opportunities throughout Module 3 to demonstrate what they have learned.

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study, as well as the goals of the assessment.

- For some students, this assessment may require more than the 35 minutes allotted. Consider providing time over multiple days if necessary.

- An opportunity to track their progress after the assessment helps students reflect on and celebrate their growth.

- To support ELLs, this lesson invites students to complete assessment tasks similar to the classroom tasks in Lessons 1–6. Students read chapter 27 of *Two Roads*, and then answer selected and constructed response questions about the text. They also write a summary of the text. Although the chapter is new to students, students are already familiar with the style, setting, and characters of the text.

- ELLs may find it challenging to independently complete the mid-unit assessment without scaffolding. Point out that the mid-unit assessment is similar to the activities they have successfully completed in class. Encourage students to do their best, and assure them that they will continue learning together after the assessment.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.B.6 and 6.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- All assessment materials (the student and teacher versions of Mid-Unit 2 Assessment: Analyze Character, Point of View, and Theme: *Two Roads*, Chapter 27) are included in Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback on this assessment, use the answer key and sample student responses (see Assessment Overview and Resources) to help complete students’ Track Progress recording form.

- The assessment asks students to plan a literary analysis paragraph as they did in Lesson 5; consider requiring students to use their plan to compose a full paragraph to gain more data about students’ mastery of W.6.9.

- Using information from this assessment, students are tracking progress toward anchor standards:

- R.1: By the end of Grade 12 I will be able to: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.

- R.10: By the end of Grade 12 I will be able to: Read and comprehend complex literary and informational texts independently and proficiently.

- On the Track Progress form, the row for RI.6.4 will not apply to this assessment and should be left blank.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will return to the anchor text, *Two Roads*, at chapter 28, continuing their analysis of theme, character, and language.

- Students’ Mid-Unit 2 Assessments will be returned in Lesson 13 with feedback.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare Mid-Unit 2 Assessment: Analyze Character, Point of View, and Theme: *Two Roads*, Chapter 27 (see Assessment Overview and Resources).

- Ensure feedback from the Module 3, Unit 1, End of Unit Assessment is ready for Opening A.

- Review the student tasks and example answers to get familiar with what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Prepare copies of handouts for students (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Continue to use the technology tools recommended throughout previous modules to create anchor charts to share with families; to record students as they participate in discussions and protocols to review with students later and to share with families; and for students to listen to and annotate text, record ideas on note-catchers, and word-process writing.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 7**. Students will also need their **Module 3, End of Unit 1 Assessment with feedback**.

- Once all students are ready, invite them to share their “stars” and “steps” with a partner. Remind students that everyone is working toward individual goals and that learning is about continued growth and development.

- Using a preferred classroom routine, collect or review the answers to **Homework: Write a Summary and Analyze Point of View: *Two Roads***, **Chapter 26**. Refer to **Homework: Write a Summary and Analyze Point of View: *Two Roads***, **Chapter 26 (example for teacher reference)**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar to or the same as previous lessons. Invite students to choose a habit of character focus for themselves for this lesson.

Work Time

A. Mid-Unit 2 Assessment: Analyze Character, Point of View, and Theme: *Two Roads*, Chapter 27 (35 minutes)

- Distribute **Mid-Unit 2 Assessment: Analyze Character, Point of View, and Theme: *Two Roads***, **Chapter 27**.

- Tell students that for this assessment, they will read the next chapter of ***Two Roads***, chapter 27. In this assessment, students analyze how Cal responds and how his point of view toward his visions changes as a result of the events in this chapter. Students also write a summary of the chapter, which includes discussion of a possible theme of the novel.

- Read the directions for each part of the assessment aloud as students follow along, reading silently. Make sure students understand the directions; paraphrase some instructions, if needed. ▲ Answer students’ questions, but refrain from supplying answers to the assessment questions themselves.

- Direct students’ attention to the following anchor charts:

- **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart**

- **Strategies to Answer Selected Response Questions anchor chart**

- Remind students to refer to these anchor charts as they read the assessment text and answer the assessment questions.

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence. Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart** and review what perseverance looks and sounds like. Remind students that because they will be reading and answering questions independently for the assessment, they may need to practice perseverance.

- Invite students to begin the assessment.

- While they are taking the assessment, circulate to monitor and document their test-taking skills.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- Before the assessment of Work Time A, underline key vocabulary in the assessment directions and prompt, and read aloud together as a class to ensure that students understand each task included in the assessment. Invite students who need lighter support to restate or clarify information for students who need heavier support.

For Heavier Support

- Display a “map” of the assessment to reference while explaining directions to the mid-unit assessment. This will reduce ambiguity and give students a clearer picture of what they can expect so that they can better allocate their time and attentional resources. Provide students with colored pencils or highlighters so that they can mark up the map as needed. Example:

Read chapter 27 of *Two Roads*. Then,

- Question 1A. Determine how Cal’s responds to an event in the text.

- Question 1B. Select text evidence that supports your answer to 1A.

- Question 2. Write a paragraph explaining how Cal’s point of view toward events in the chapter change.

- Question 3. Write a summary of the chapter.

Closing and Assessment

A. Track Progress – RL.6.1 (5 minutes)

- Give students specific, positive feedback on their completion of the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment. Provide students with **Synopsis: *Two Roads***, **Chapter 27** if students need clarification on the chapter they read for the assessment.

- Distribute **Track Progress folders, Track Progress: Read, Understand, and Explain New Text, Writing Record**, and **sticky notes**.

- Tell students the sticky notes are for them to find evidence of the following criteria:

- RL.6.1

- Guide students through completing the form. The row for RI.6.4 will not apply to this assessment and should be left blank. Encourage students to orally paraphrase the meaning of the Track Progress criteria, self-assess, and discuss the evidence with a partner before they begin writing. Direct students to complete Writing Record for the writing they did as part of the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment (paragraph and summary).

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their habit of character focus for this lesson.

Homework

A. Practice Pronoun Case

- Students complete **Homework: Practice Pronoun Case: *Two Roads***, **Chapter 24**.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread chapter 28 in *Two Roads* in preparation for studying this chapter in the next lesson.
