5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

RL.6.1, RL.6.3, SL.6.1, L.6.3a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

So I came here speaking English **and now I am learning Indian**. (from page 231 of *Two Roads* by Joseph Bruchac)

**Lesson 8 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after students read chapter 22 of *Two Roads* in Work Time B.

**Rationale**

- Module Guiding Question and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the guiding question (**What kinds of experiences did students have at American Indian boarding schools?**) by showing how Native American students sometimes forged strong bonds with one another at American Indian boarding schools. These bonds led to exchange of tribal knowledge (i.e., language) that may have strengthened students’ ties to their heritage, despite the fact that the goal of American Indian boarding schools was to erase identity and heritage. This sentence also helps students address RL.6.3 by illustrating one way in which Cal has changed in response to his time at Challagi and L.6.3a by providing an example of the familiar and narrative-style language that is appropriate in personal letters like this one. Supporting standards: RL.6.1, SL.6.1.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses verbs written in the past simple (**came here**) and present progressive tenses (**I am learning**) to highlight change and it uses a conjunction (**and**) to link two independent clauses.

- Transfer: independent clause with past simple verb + **and now** + independent clause with present progressive verb to show change and organize events chronologically in the letters students write from Cal to Possum.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **So I came here speaking English <u>and now I am learning Indian</u>.**

- Ask:

“What is this sentence about?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **and now I am learning Indian**.

- Ask:

“What do the words and now tell us about this chunk?” (They tell us that this chunk describes an event or action that is taking place at that time.)

“How does the grammatical structure of the clause I am learning Indian relate to or support the words and now?” (I am learning Indian is written in the present progressive. We use the present progressive to describe an ongoing action that is taking place at that time.)

“When Cal writes I am learning Indian, does he mean that he is, in the exact moment that he is writing the letter, also learning new words in Creek? What does this tell us about different ways that the present progressive can be used?” (No, he doesn’t mean he is learning Creek at that moment; this tells us that the present progressive can be used not just to describe something in progress at the moment of writing but also to describe an action that is ongoing and taking place around the moment of writing.)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **So I came here speaking English <u>and now I am learning Indian</u>.**

- Ask:

“If Challagi and other American Indian boarding schools punish students for using their tribal languages at school, how has Cal learned so much Creek at Challagi?” (He is spending time with the other boys in his Creek gang. He hears people use Creek words around him.)

“How is Cal’s growing knowledge of Creek related to his development as a character? Hint: Think back to the early chapters of the novel, when Cal first learned he would be going to Challagi.” (Responses will vary, but students may point out that, in the beginning of the novel, Cal did not speak any Creek nor did he know that he was part Creek Indian. Cal is learning more about what it means to be Creek at the same time that he is learning more of the language from his friends.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question:  
What kinds of experiences did students have at American Indian boarding schools?” (Responses will vary.)
