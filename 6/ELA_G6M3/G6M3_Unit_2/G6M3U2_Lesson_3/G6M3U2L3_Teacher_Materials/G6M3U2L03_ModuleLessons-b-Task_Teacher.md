<td><p><strong>Mallet is an ineffective teacher who disregards and ignores his students.</strong></p>

<td><p><strong>Handler is tough and treats Cal roughly, but also seems to have some level of care toward him, even though he uses disrespectful and prejudiced language.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A handler is a person who trains a fighter or boxer for a fight—in the next chapter, we find out that Mr. Handler is actually the trainer for the boxing at the school—or a dog for a show. This seems to match his personality in that, though he does care about Cal and Possum, his methods are tough and rough.</strong></p></td>
