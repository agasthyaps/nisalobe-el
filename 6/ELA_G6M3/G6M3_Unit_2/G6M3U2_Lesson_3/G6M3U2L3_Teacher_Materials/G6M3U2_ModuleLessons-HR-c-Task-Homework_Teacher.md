Homework: Analyze Point of View:  
*Two Roads*, Chapter 22

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Reread part of chapter 22, from page 229 starting at “Cogitating is his word of the day . . .” through the end of Cal’s letter to Pop on page 232. Answer the prompt below.

How does Cal’s point of view toward Challagi in the letter differ from his point of view toward Challagi in his inner thoughts? What does this difference convey about Cal’s character? Use evidence from the excerpt to support your ideas. Begin with a topic sentence that restates and answers the prompt. (RL.6.1, RL.6.3, RL.6.6, W.6.10)

Answers will vary, but may include: Cal’s point of view as he expresses it in the letter to Pop differs from his inner thoughts. He does not reveal the truth of what he is really feeling in the letter so he won’t make Pop feel bad about leaving Cal at Challagi. At the start of this excerpt, Cal’s inner thoughts convey his point of view toward school. This is where he refers to Greek mythology to show that he feels trapped in a difficult and unfamiliar place. He wants to find a way to escape and be with Pop. He even lets himself blame his father for his situation when he says, “But then again, it was not Theseus’s father who took him into that maze and told him to stay there.” On the other hand, in the letter to Pop, Cal’s point of view toward school is much more positive. Even though he mentions that he misses Pop, he doesn’t go into detail about the hard parts of school. Instead, he talks about Possum, that he is “keeping out of trouble” and has “learned some useful things.” He ends the letter by saying “I will do my best to make you proud of me.” In the letter, Cal seems to be hiding his true feelings. He is not telling Pop the whole story, to protect Pop. Cal doesn’t want to upset Pop by letting him know how he really feels about Challagi, because he knows Pop is doing something important. He’s trying to be strong and a good son.
