Opportunities to Extend Learning

- An optional Mini Language Dive, intended for use after students read chapter 22 of *Two Roads* in Work Time A, is available in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Draw attention to the use of allusion in this chapter. Besides allusions to Greek mythology, Cal also mentions that Possum has borrowed his copy of *The Call of the Wild*. Provide some basic background on this novel by Jack London: Buck, a domesticated dog, is stolen from his home and sold to miners in need of sled dogs to aid them as they travel through the icy Yukon during the Gold Rush. Beaten, starved, and pushed to his limits, Buck has to tap into his primitive side and channel his wolf ancestors to survive the harsh treatment and terrain. After the death of his only friend, Jack Thornton, Buck chooses to leave civilization behind, join a wolf pack, and heed the call of the wild. Invite students to discuss the possible connections between the connotation of *The Call of the Wild* and Cal’s experiences at the boarding school.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- The previous lesson reinforced work with theme in a close read and Language Dive that both supported students as they determined possible identity-related themes in the text. In this lesson, students examine how the structure of chapter 22 and the use of allusion and connotation all contribute to reveal a theme. Students synthesize this learning by planning a literary summary of the chapter containing the key details and a theme statement, a repeated skill from Modules 1 and 2.

Support All Students

- In Chapter 22, Cal has a brief encounter with an instructor who, “despite the fact that he is an Indian himself” writes Cal “a demerit for typical Indian laziness” (235–236). Later in the chapter, Mr. O’Boyle demonstrates blatant racism when he asks Cal, “‘You like-um them shoes, Chief? You want buy-um?’” (241). These passages illustrates some of the prejudices held towards Indians, and some students may find it offensive. Encourage concerned students to process these experiences from Cal’s perspective, using evidence from the text. Consider questions like: How do you think Cal feels about Mr. Handler and Mr. O’Boyle? Why do you think Cal points out that Mr. Handler is himself a North Carolina Cherokee? How might Handler’s being Cherokee impact Cal’s understanding of this situation? What does Cal’s reaction to Mr. O’Boyle’s mockery reveal about his experiences with these types of encounters?

- To support ELLs during the Analyze Structure activity of Work Time B, strategically assign chapter sections, which vary in length, according to students’ needs. ELLs who need heavier support may wish to be responsible for Section 1, which is the shortest section, or Section 2, which is predominantly a letter from Cal to Pop, written in simple language. Challenge more comfortable readers with the longer and more complex Section 3. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson guides students through a detailed analysis of the structure and theme of chapter 22 in the text. In small groups, students read an assigned section of the text and then report back to their larger group. This process reduces the amount of text that students are expected to independently read. This lesson also features a Mini Language Dive that centers around a sentence that may feel especially resonant to ELLs: “So I came here speaking English and now I am learning Indian.” In exploring Cal’s relationships with the English and Creek languages, ELLs may uncover attitudes or experiences with which to compare or contrast their own.

- ELLs may find it challenging to answer complex questions about their assigned chapter sections during Work Time B, especially if they struggled to understand the overall chapter during Work Time A. Strategically group students during this exercise, so that students who need heavier support can borrow from the insights of more comfortable readers.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.8, 6.II.A.1, 6.II.A.2, 6.II.B.3, and 6.II.B.5.

Assessment Guidance

- Encourage students to use their Close Read and Language Dive note-catchers from Unit 2, Lesson 2 to inform their responses on the next row of the Analyze Point of View note-catcher.

- Students can revisit summaries they wrote in Modules 1 and 2 as models for their summary planning in this lesson.

- For homework, students craft a fully developed explanatory paragraph about how Cal’s point of view is present in his inner thoughts but kept hidden in his letter to Pop. Remind students that when answering a prompt that asks about differences, they should be sure to address both topics (the inner thoughts versus the letter). Likewise, if there was a question about a change in Cal’s point of view, they’d talk about what it was previously and then what it is now. Remind students to also use a topic sentence that restates and answers the prompt.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will revisit Language standards by continuing to build their understanding of the different types of and uses for pronouns. The End of Unit 2 Assessment will measure students’ ability to revise their work to recognize and correct inappropriate shifts in pronoun number and person, ensure that pronouns are in the proper case, and correct vague pronouns.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RL.6.6 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Direct students to retrieve their **Analyze Point of View: *Two Roads*** **note-catcher** and anchor text, ***Two Roads***. Instruct students to fill in the row for chapter 21 regarding Cal’s point of view towards the Challagi students’ relationship with their Indian identity, recalling the reading they did in the previous lesson. Remind students to reference the text for evidence rather than relying on memory. Use **equity sticks** to call on students to share their entries. Refer to **Analyze Point of View: *Two Roads*** **note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Using a preferred classroom routine, collect or review the answers to **Homework: Race and Ethnicity**. Refer to **Homework: Race and Ethnicity (example for teacher reference).** Direct students to add the terms *race* and *ethnicity* into their **vocabulary logs**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar to or the same as previous lessons. Invite students to choose a habit of character focus for themselves for this lesson.

Work Time

A. Read *Two Roads*, Chapter 22 – RL.6.6 (20 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Read chapter 22 of the text, using **Text Guide: *Two Roads*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students who are ready to read independently or in small groups should be released to this independence. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky notes**, add to the **Gist anchor chart: *Two Roads***, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Students continue to identify how characters in the text demonstrate habits of character. Refer to the **Gist anchor chart: *Two Roads*** **(example for teacher reference)** and **chapter synopsis** as needed, as well as any other appropriate resources.

- Gist: Cal writes a letter to his father but can’t send it because he doesn’t know where his father is. He discovers he has money on his account and buys new shoes in town.

- Say:

“On pages 229 and 230, Cal makes allusions to Greek mythology you may remember from Module 1. An allusion is a reference to a well-known story; in this case, to Virgil and Perseus in the Underworld and to the story of “Theseus and the Minotaur.”

- Ask:

“What connotation, or feeling, do both of these myths evoke?” (Negative. Both of these Greek stories contain difficult and painful experiences in unfamiliar and confusing settings.)

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What do the connotations of these allusions convey about Cal’s point of view toward his time at the school?” (Their negative connotations mirror Cal’s point of view towards Challagi. He’s trying to make the best of it, but he really wishes he could escape and be with Pop.)

- Refocus students, and direct them to retrieve their Analyze Point of View: *Two Roads* note-catcher. Instruct students to fill in the row for chapter 22 about Cal’s point of view toward Challagi using the examples discussed. Using a total participation technique, invite students to share out their responses. Refer to Analyze Point of View: *Two Roads* (example for teacher reference) as needed.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time A, after students read chapter 22 of *Two Roads*, invite students to participate in a Mini Language Dive in small groups to interpret a description of Cal’s experience at Challagi Indian Industrial School and connect it to one of the module guiding questions. This Mini Language Dive also supports students in their analysis of Cal’s character development and in their ability to use verbs written in the past simple and present progressive tenses to show change.

For Heavier Support

- To reinforce practice with the structure introduced in the Mini Language Dive of Work Time A, invite students to use variations of the Practice sentence frame to reflect on their learning across the module, school year, or lesson. Provide frames of varying complexity that students can complete to enhance their understanding of this structure. For example,

- I started this module knowing very little about American Indian boarding schools and now I am learning \_\_\_.

- I thought that reading novels in English was too difficult and now I \_\_\_.

- I started the year \_\_\_ and now \_\_\_.

- I \_\_\_ and now I \_\_\_.

Work Time

B. Analyze Structure and Theme – RL.6.2, RL.6.5 (15 minutes)

- Explain that this chapter is broken into five sections. Point out that the sections in the chapter are separated by a larger white space in the text. Explain that students will work together to analyze how each section functions within the chapter and develops the setting and plot of the novel.

- Move students into groups of five. Distribute and display the **Analyze Structure: *Two Roads***, **Chapter 22 note-catcher**. Review the directions and assist the groups in splitting up the sections. Explain that each student will take the lead on answering one of the questions on their note-catcher and then sharing their responses with the rest of the group. Provide access to **print or online dictionaries** as needed.

- Direct students to begin completing the questions on the Analyze Structure: *Two Roads*, Chapter 22 note-catcher for their assigned section. Remind them to share their ideas with their group when done. Every member of the group should collect the responses on their note-catcher for all the sections. Refer to the **Analyze Structure: *Two Roads***, **Chapter 22 note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** as needed. Circulate as students work, clarifying directions and supporting students as needed.

- Using a total participation technique, ask:

“How do the five sections function within the structure of the chapter? How does each help to develop the setting and characters of *Two Roads*?” (Each section of this chapter is a different setting where the readers sees Cal interacting with different people.)

“How does the structure of this chapter help to develop a possible theme of *Two Roads*?” (This chapter helps to convey the theme that one should respect all we encounter. In each of these sections, Cal acts with integrity and respect toward each of the four men and even when he’s writing the letter to Pop. He is treated very differently by each of the four men, but he never changes how he responds. He maintains his temper and acts respectfully even when he is overtly disrespected. By using this five-section structure, Bruchac lets the reader see Cal in all these different experiences, and as a result of the whole chapter, we understand more about Cal and more about this theme of the novel.)

- Record student responses on the **Determine Themes: *Two Roads*** **anchor chart**. Reference **Determine Themes: *Two Roads*** **anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Closing and Assessment

A. Plan a Summary: *Two Roads*, Chapter 22 – RL.6.2 (5 minutes)

- Explain to students that now that they have determined the gist and analyzed structure and theme, with a partner they will use that previous analysis to help them plan a summary of the chapter.

- Display and review the **Criteria for an Effective Summary anchor chart**. Remind students they wrote literary and informational summaries in Module 1 and informational summaries in Module 2. During this module, they will be working on literary summaries again.

- Distribute and display the **Summary Planner: *Two Roads***, **Chapter 22**. Explain that students only need to plan their summary during this time; they will have time to actually write it in the next lesson. Refer to **Summary Planner: *Two Roads***, **Chapter 22 (example for teacher reference)**, as needed.

- Instruct students to save their planner in a safe place as they will need it at the beginning of Lesson 4.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their habit of character focus for this lesson.

Homework

A. Analyze Point of View

- Students complete **Homework: Analyze Point of View: *Two Roads***, **Chapter 22**.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread chapter 23 in *Two Roads* in preparation for studying this chapter in the next lesson.
