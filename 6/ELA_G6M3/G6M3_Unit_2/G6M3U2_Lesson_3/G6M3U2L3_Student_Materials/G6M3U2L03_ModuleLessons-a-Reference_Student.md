- During geography class, the teacher reads a magazine and tells the class not to disturb him.

- After geography, Possum and Cal make their way to one of the industrial classes.

- Cal is thinking about how he has written letters to his father but cannot send them because he does not know where to address the letters.

- Cal’s work at the harness shop has caused calluses to form on the palms of his hands. Possum muses that maybe they can work in shoe repair today. Possum looks down at Cal’s shoes. The shoes given to him by the school are not well-made. They are uncomfortable and already falling apart.

- Possum asks Cal why he won’t buy some sneakers. Cal responds that he does not have any money. Possum is surprised that Cal’s pop didn’t leave any money for Cal in his school bursary account. Cal admits that he had no idea about the bursary account.

- Cal and Possum make it to the harness shop, where Mr. Handler looks at the state of Cal’s shoes and repairs them quickly.

- Possum takes Cal to the bursar’s office. Cal learns that he has \$13.28 in his account. Cal withdraws four dollars.

- On the Saturday that they are allowed to go into town, Possum takes Cal to O’Boyle’s Dry Goods. Cal is able to buy himself a pair of shoes.
