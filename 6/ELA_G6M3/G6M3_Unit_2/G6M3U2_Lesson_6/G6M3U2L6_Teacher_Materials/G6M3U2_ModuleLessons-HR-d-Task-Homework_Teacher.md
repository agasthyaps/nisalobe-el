Homework: Write a Summary and Analyze Point of View: *Two Roads*, Chapter 26

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Reread chapter 26 of *Two Roads* and complete the tasks below.

1.  Write a summary of chapter 26 of *Two Roads*. Remember, a summary should include: an introduction stating the chapter, a brief outline of what the text is about, a possible theme, key details from the text to support your theme, and no opinions or judgments. (RL.6.1, RL.6.2, RL.6.5, W.6.10)

Answers will vary, but may include: Chapter 26 of *Two Roads* by Joseph Bruchac informs readers that Cal will not be reuniting with his father anytime soon. Cal is called to Morrell’s office and reads a letter Pop sent to the superintendent. Pops asks the superintendent’s permission for Cal to remain at Challagi through the summer. Cal is disappointed, but he understands that Pop feels a duty to continue his work with the Bonus Army. A theme that emerges from the chapter is that family members take care of each other, even when it requires self-sacrifice. In previous chapters, Cal has often thought of running away from Challagi, but he has remained, based on his promise to Pop. Chapter 26 reminds the readers of Cal’s promise to Pop and Cal’s willingness to put his wants to the side in order to support Pop’s mission.

2.  Write a paragraph that explains how Cal’s point of view toward the Bonus Army protest has changed as conveyed by his vision in chapter 26. Use evidence from the chapter to support your ideas. (RL.6.1, RL.6.5, RL.6.6, W.6.10)

Answers will vary, but may include: Earlier in the book, Pop made the decision to go and help the movement. He did it so he could help his fellow soldiers and so he and Cal could lead a better life. Though Cal is sad to be without Pop, he supports his decision and what the Bonus Army is trying to do. In his letter to Pop in chapter 22 he says, “I bet they were just men like you who want a fair deal” (232). Cal is trying to be a good son so that Pop can do this important thing. In Chapter 26, however, Cal has a vision during a dream after he hears that Pop cannot come back yet to get him. He describes it, writing, “And that was when the soldiers started firing. I felt the bullets entering my chest and I was falling, dying . . .” (275). He fears that Pop is in danger in a way he hadn’t considered before.
