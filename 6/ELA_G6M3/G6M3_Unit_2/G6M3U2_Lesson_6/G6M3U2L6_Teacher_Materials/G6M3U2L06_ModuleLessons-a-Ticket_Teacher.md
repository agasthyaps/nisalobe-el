Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 6

L.6.1b

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, read the learning targets. Next, read the sentence from chapter 25 of *Two Roads*. Determine the function of the pronoun **myself** in the sentence. Complete the sentence frame, and explain your thinking.

“It is exciting to be among so many others like **myself**, all of us back in the army again in a way” (267).

In this sentence, **myself** is acting as a(n) **<u>reflexive</u>** pronoun.

intensive/reflexive

I know this because

the pronoun is not in the sentence to emphasize anyone or anything. If the pronoun was removed, the sentence would be incomplete and not make sense.
