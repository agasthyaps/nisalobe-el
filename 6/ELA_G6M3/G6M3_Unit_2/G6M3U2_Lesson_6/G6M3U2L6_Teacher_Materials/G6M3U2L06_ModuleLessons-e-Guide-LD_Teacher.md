**Sentence**

I know**, partially from what I’ve learned about being Creek and partially because a part of me has always known,** that my dreams are connecting me to other people (from page 275 of *Two Roads* by Joseph Bruchac).

Launch

This Language Dive focuses on one critical use of commas: their role in setting off parenthetical elements in a sentence (L.6.2a). Before beginning the Language Dive, consider inviting students, in small groups, to generate a list of the many ways in which commas can be used in their writing (e.g., to separate items in a list; to distinguish a dependent clause). It may be helpful to consolidate groups’ answers and create a punctuation anchor chart to which students can add other punctuation marks and example sentences in future units and modules.

I know

Deconstruct: Language Goals

- **I**

“Whom is this pronoun, I, referring to?” (Cal.)

“Can you figure out why this chunk does not include quotation marks?” (Because Cal is not speaking this sentence aloud; it represents one of his inner thoughts.)

that my dreams are connecting me to other people.

Deconstruct: Language Goals

- **that**

“Can you figure out why this chunk begins with the word that?” (Because this chunk introduces an independent clause \[my dreams are connecting me to other people\] that is embedded within the larger sentence. The word that can sometimes function as a conjunction that introduces an embedded clause.)

“Do these two chunks form a complete sentence? How do you know?” (Yes; because there is a subject, a verb, and a complete thought.)

“If you were writing this sentence yourself, what other information might you want to include in the sentence? What are some ways to add more information to an already complete sentence?” (Answers will vary.)

, partially from what I’ve learned about being Creek and partially because a part of me has always known,

Deconstruct: Language Goals (Focus Structure)

- **,**

“Can you figure out the function of the punctuation mark in this chunk?” (The author uses commas. The commas are setting off a piece of information that is important, but not grammatically necessary.)

“Where does this chunk come in the sentence? How do you know?” (This chunk comes between the first and third chunk, and sits in the middle of the sentence. We know this because it has commas on both sides, so it can’t begin or end the sentence.)

“In the first two chunks, Cal said that he knows his dreams connect him to other people. According to this chunk, what are the two ways Cal has come to know this?” (\[1\] He has learned more about being Creek and knows that other Creek people, like Possum’s aunt, have visions and premonitions that connect them to other people too, and \[2\] he always knew it deep-down.)

- **partially**

“Can you figure out why the author used the word partially twice in this chunk?” (By using the word partially to introduce each explanation, the author is emphasizing that both explanations contribute in some way to Cal’s knowing that his dreams connect him to others. \[adverb\])

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Students can complete the frame below, using two commas to insert their own parenthetical element into this sentence.

> I know, \_\_\_\_\_\_, that I am improving as a reader. (I know, even if I still have more learning to do, that I am improving as a reader.)  Step 3

- To provide lighter support: “Can you think of more than one chunk that could complete this frame?”

- To provide heavier support: Provide possible chunks for students to select among and explain (e.g., partially because I read faster than before; because of my bigger vocabulary; even if sometimes I don’t feel it; and I’m proud to say).

I know, partially from what I’ve learned about being Creek and partially because a part of me has always known, that my dreams are connecting me to other people.

Reconstruct

- Ask:

“What is the relationship between the third chunk, partially from what I’ve learned about being Creek and partially because a part of me has always known, and the first chunk, I know?” (The first chunk says that Cal knows something, and the third chunk explains how Cal knows it.)

“Can you figure out why the author chose to insert this information in the middle of the sentence, rather than at the beginning or the end?” (Answers will vary, but may include: because this chunk builds on the idea that Cal knows something, so it should be connected to the verb know; because if this chunk were at the beginning of the sentence, it would be too long.)

“What does this sentence reveal about Cal’s point of view toward his visions?” (Answers will vary, but may include: this sentence shows that Cal believes in these visions and their ability to connect him to others; he believes these visions have always served the same purpose, though now he connects that purpose more to his Creek identity.)

“How does the third chunk, partially from what I’ve learned about being Creek and partially because a part of me has always known, support the reader’s understanding of Cal’s point of view toward his visions?” (Answers will vary, but may include: the third chunk explains the sources of Cal’s ideas toward his visions; it shows a relationship between his new and older identities and illustrates how he is connected to his visions in multiple ways.)

- Students can reread the paragraph of page 275 that contains the Language Dive sentence, as well as the paragraph below it, which begins, “This dream was about the living.”

“How does this sentence function within the structure of these paragraphs? How does this sentence help develop the plot of Two Roads?” (Answers will vary, but may include: that this sentence explicitly presents the idea that Cal’s visions are often about, or through the eyes of, other people. This sentence also shows that Cal believes in the nature of his visions more than ever. This sentence helps develop the plot of Two Roads by emphasizing Cal’s connection to other people, especially Pop. It is precisely that connection that compels Cal to leave Challagi and find Pop in Washington.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Answers will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the module guiding question, ‘What factors influence our identities?’” (Answers will vary, but may include: this Language Dive emphasizes the idea that our identities come both from things we’ve always known about ourselves and from new things we learn.)

- Students can use Conversation Cues as they discuss. To provide heavier support, display a suggested sequence, such as the one below:

- Goal 1: Let’s take time to think and write or sketch.

- Goal 1: Can you say more about that?

- Goal 2: Who can tell us what your classmate said in your own words?

- Goal 3: What, in the text, makes you think so?

Practice (Sentence)

- “Cal is convinced, partially \_\_\_\_\_ and partially \_\_\_\_\_, that he has to leave Challagi and go find Pop.” (Cal is convinced, partially due to his vision and partially because of the support of his friends, that he has to leave Challagi and go find Pop.)  Step 4

- To provide lighter support: “Can you rewrite this sentence from Pop’s perspective, using a similar frame?”

- To provide heavier support: Invite students to discuss the meaning of the sentence and locate evidence from the text in home language groups.

Language Chunk Wall Suggestions

- Language to connect words, phrases, clauses: **, partially <u>from</u> what I’ve learned about being Creek and partially <u>because</u> a part of me has always known**

- Language to talk about a reason: **, partially <u>from</u> what I’ve learned about being Creek and partially <u>because</u> a part of me has always known**

- Language to capture a reader’s imagination or attention: **that <u>my dreams are connecting me to other people</u>**.
