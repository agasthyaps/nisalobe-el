**Part A**

Revise one of the sentences to improve its variety and meaning.

Answers will vary, but may include:

Before:

I hear voices.

After:

I hear two voices as rough as the gravel on which their owners’ feet walk as they approach my boxcar.

**Part B**

Explain the changes you made and how they improve the sentence.

Answers will vary, but may include: I added more precise and descriptive words. This helps the reader to better imagine the details of this moment and how Cal feels when he hears someone approaching his boxcar. The simple sentence didn’t provide specific details about the setting or describe the voices that he heard.
