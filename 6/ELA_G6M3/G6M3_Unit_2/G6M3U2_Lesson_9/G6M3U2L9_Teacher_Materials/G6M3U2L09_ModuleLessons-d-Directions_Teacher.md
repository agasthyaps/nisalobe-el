Final Word Protocol: Sentence Variety

SL.6.1

(For Teacher Reference)

**Purpose**

This protocol is designed to help students understand the meaning of a text or discuss an open-ended question, particularly to see how meaning can be constructed and supported by the ideas of others.

**Rules**

Students may not change the plot of the anchor text.

Students may not change what other group members contributed to the sentence.

**Procedure**

1.  Each group selects a timekeeper and facilitator.

2.  Students then number off in the order that they will share their response.

3.  The presenter (student number 1) is given a sentence. The presenter reads the sentence aloud.

4.  All group members locate the sentence in the novel. The facilitator leads a 1-minute discussion around the context of the sentence.

5.  The presenter reminds the group of the rules. The presenter reads the sentence aloud again.

6.  Each group member adds to the sentence, either a single word or a relevant phrase.

7.  The presenter adds the final update to the sentence and writes the expanded sentence on a sticky note.

8.  Swap sentences with another triad.

9.  Follow steps 3–8 with a different presenter (student number 2).
