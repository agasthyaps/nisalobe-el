**Chapter 29, “Wounds”**

- Cal walks along the top of the train car and swings down into an open boxcar. He hits a slippery spot on the floor, stumbles backwards, and nearly falls out of the train. The strong hand of a stranger pulls him back into the boxcar.

- The stranger introduces herself as Gale. Gale feeds Cal and gives him another shirt to wear because his shirt ripped on a nail when he stumbled.

- Gale asks Cal about his destination. When Cal reveals that he is travelling to Washington, DC, Gale proves to be a wealth of knowledge.

- Gale informs Cal what is going on in DC and warns him that he may be walking into a war zone.

- Cal wakes up and finds himself alone in the train car. Cal looks out on the landscape he’s passing and remembering Gale’s words. He suddenly finds himself in another vision with the sound of tanks and rifles, as well as the smell of blood.

- Cal gets off the train in St. Louis and spends the night in the woods because he did not recognize any familiar faces in the hobo jungle near St. Louis.

- As Cal is riding the train that will deposit him at his final destination, he begins to think of Challagi.

- Cal thinks about the true friends he has made at Challagi. He questions whether or not he misses Challagi, which causes a moment of confusion for him.

- Cal realizes that he has never felt a sense of belonging as he does with his friends at Challagi. He acknowledges what it has meant to him to connect with his Creek identity.

- Cal questions what will happen after he finds Pop.
