Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- L.6.3a – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they use conjunctions to combine short sentences from chapter 28 of *Two Roads*.

- RL.6.1 – Work Time A: After reading chapter 29 of *Two Roads*, students use evidence from the text to answer questions.

- RL.6.3 – Work Time A: Students answer questions about Cal’s conversation with Gale and how that conversation helps to develop the reader’s understanding of Cal’s character.

- RL.6.5 – Work Time A: Students answer questions about how the scene with Cal and Gale functions within the larger text structure.

- L.6.3a – Work Time B: Students participate in a Final Word protocol to practice revising sentences to enhance their style and meaning.

- L.6.3a – Closing and Assessment A: Students complete an exit ticket in which they revise a sentence to improve its variety and meaning.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- In chapter 22 of *Two Roads*, Cal explains that “in exchange for \[Possum\] continuing to show me the ropes \[at Challagi\] . . . I have been finding him a new word each day from my dictionary” (229). Invite students to collect Possum’s words and incorporate them into their own lexicon. Offer a simple reward for students who correctly use the words in conversation or find them in another text.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students examined a variety of sentence patterns employed by the author in chapter 28 of *Two Roads*. As a class, they co-created an anchor chart, listing ways to add more variety into their sentence patterns to enhance meaning, engage reader interest, and add style. This lesson provides additional practice with this skill, allowing students more independence as they work in triads to revise a simple, ineffective sentence.

Support All Students

- Chapter 29 is set in an environment that is very different from the chapters students have already read, which mostly took place at Challagi. It might be helpful for some students to have additional support while reading this chapter. Consider reading aloud whole class and having students follow along quietly.

- To support ELLs, this lesson builds upon the learning of the previous lesson regarding sentence variety. Whereas students analyzed varied sentences in the previous lesson, in this lesson they have the opportunity to practice varying sentences of their own through a Final Word protocol. The collaboration built into the Final Word protocol supports ELLs as they learn from and elaborate on the thoughts and ideas of their classmates.

- ELLs may find it challenging to use more sentence variety in their own writing, even if they understand the stylistic consequences of repetitive sentence structure. For students with developing grammatical awareness, the rules of breaking up or combining sentences may be unclear, leading to structurally inappropriate or inaccurate writing. Remind students that there are many ways to improve sentence variety and that the Sentence Variety anchor chart introduced in the previous lesson illustrates many of these methods.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.B.6, 6.II.B.5, 6.II.C.6, and 6.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- Instruction about sentence variety continues in this lesson with a focus on combining sentences using conjunctions in the entrance ticket. Though the entrance ticket contains a brief reminder about what a conjunction does, along with some examples to use, this activity assumes that students have some knowledge of conjunctions and how they are used to combine sentences. Work Time B also provides an opportunity for students to use figurative and vivid language to increase reader interest and meaning. Use these activities to assess student understanding and review these concepts, as necessary, to ensure clarity while students work to understand the continued sentence variety work in this lesson.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will finish reading the anchor text and participate in a text-based discussion of the novel’s conclusion. They will also launch their next writing assignment—a narrative letter in which students will incorporate their learning about correct pronoun usage and sentence variety with their understanding of how the novel’s narrator, Cal, responds to challenges. Revising the short narrative letter, written from Cal’s perspective to Possum and exploring his decision to return or not to Challagi school, will serve as the End of Unit 2 assessment.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Preread chapter 29 of *Two Roads* to identify potentially challenging vocabulary or plot points.

- Review the new materials used in this lesson to ensure clarity about what students will need to know and be able to do.

- Review the Final Word protocol for use during Work Time B (see the Classroom Protocols document located on the Tools Page: http://eled.org/tools).

- Strategically arrange students into groups of three for the Final Word protocol in Work Time B.

- Print and cut out enough sentences from Practice Sentence Variety: Final Word Protocol to provide one per triad. Consider laminating these to be used multiple times.

- Prepare copies of handouts for students (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Opening A: Use magnetic poetry kits or a similar type of manipulative to have students combine the sentences using different conjunctions. As they swap out each conjunction, ask students to explain how the new word changes the meaning of the sentence.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.6.3a (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 9**. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 9 (example for teacher reference)** for possible responses. Display the **Sentence Variety anchor chart** for student reference as they work on the entrance ticket.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar to or the same as previous lessons. Invite students to choose a habit of character focus for themselves for this lesson.

Work Time

A. Read *Two Roads*, Chapter 29 – RL.6.3, RL.6.5 (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Read chapter 29, using **Text Guide: *Two Roads*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students who are ready to read independently or in small groups should be released to this independence. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky notes**, update the **Gist anchor chart: *Two Roads***, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Students continue to identify how characters in the text demonstrate habits of character. Refer to the **Gist anchor chart: *Two Roads*** **(example for teacher reference)** and **chapter synopsis** as needed, as well as any other appropriate resources.

- Gist of chapter 29: Cal travels for two days on the train and learns that his vision is correct, the government troops have attacked the protesting veterans.

- Turn and Talk:

“How does the scene between Cal and Gale function within the structure of the novel? How does this part of the chapter help to develop the plot of *Two Roads*?” (The introduction of Gale and the conversation between she and Cal help to convey important background information to the reader about what’s been happening in Washington with the Bonus Army. Without the inclusion of this character and what she tells Cal, neither the reader nor Cal would have information necessary to understand what’s to come and the larger context into which Cal is about to walk in his search for Pop. The events to come will likely make more sense because we have this information.)

“How does the way Cal responds to Gale and what she shares with him help to develop our understanding of his character?” (Cal is grateful and kind to Gale; he respects her and appreciates all she does for him including giving food, first aid, clothing, and information. This interaction shows that Cal does live by his own code and treats everyone as he would like to be treated.)

- Ask students to retrieve their **Analyze Character: *Two Roads*** **note-catcher**. Direct students to complete the row for chapter 29 on their note-catcher using evidence from the chapter. Using a total participation technique, invite students to share their responses. Refer to the **Analyze Character: *Two Roads*** **(example for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

B. Discuss Sentence Variety – L.6.3a (20 minutes)

- Remind students of their learning in the last lesson. Reiterate that strong writers use sentence variety to maintain the reader’s attention and add style.

- Remind students that they have been experimenting with sentence structure since Module 1. One of the main goals of Language Dives is to help them unpack complex syntax in compelling sentences as a way to analyze models of effective writing in order to enhance their own skills as writers. Sentences, like the ones featured in Language Dives, that showcase of variety of sentence patterns enhance a text’s meaning and the reader’s interest.

- Invite students to move into their predetermined triads.

- Inform students that they will be participating in a protocol designed to give them an opportunity to practice sentence variety. The objective is to add words to the given sentence to make it more colorful and interesting for the reader.

- Display the **Final Word Protocol: Sentence Variety.** Read the procedure for the protocol aloud as students read silently.

- Invite two volunteers to help model the protocol.

- Answer any clarifying questions about the protocol from the student volunteers.

- Read the following sentence aloud:

“Cal dismounted Dakota.”

- Ask the first student to provide an addition to the sentence. (Cal dismounted Dakota hastily.)

- Ask the second student to provide an addition to the sentence. (Cal dismounted Dakota hastily and sprinted across the train yard.)

- Provide the final addition to the sentence and write the sentence on a sticky note. (Heart racing, Cal dismounted Dakota hastily and sprinted across the train yard.)

- Thank the student volunteers and have them return to their seats.

- Turn and Talk:

“What did the additions to the original sentence contribute?” (They added more detail, brought the scene to life, and made the sentence more interesting in general.)

- Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**. Remind students of what *responsibility* looks and sounds like in this activity. Remind students to lift up these positive behaviors as they are sharing ideas in their triads.

- Direct triads to complete the first two steps of the protocol. Ask student number 1 of each group to raise their hand.

- Distribute a sentence from **Practice Sentence Variety: Final Word Protocol** to each student with their hand raised.

- Invite students to begin the protocol. Remind students that groups should record their final iteration of the sentence on a sticky note.

- Regain student focus after 3 minutes.

- Have triads swap sentences, ensuring that each group gets a new sentence to revise.

- Invite students to conduct another round of the protocol with student number 2 as the presenter.

- Refocus student attention after 3 minutes.

- Inform students that student 3 of each triad will serve as the group’s spokesperson.

- Direct the triads to choose one of their revised sentences. Invite each triad’s spokesperson to read the initial sentence and the revised sentence. The spokesperson should also provide a rationale for the revised sentence.

- Focus students on the Sentence Variety anchor chart.

- Turn and Talk:

“Based on the sentences we examined today, what are some ways that a writer can add more variety into their sentence patterns to enhance meaning, engage reader interest, and add style?”

- Use **equity sticks** to call on students to share their ideas, and add them to the anchor chart.

- Refer to the **Sentence Variety anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- During the Final Word protocol of Work Time B, challenge students who need heavier support to continue the protocol using sentences they themselves select from the text. Alternatively, provide students with longer sentences from the text and invite them to move through the protocol in reverse (e.g., by removing elements from the sentence, rather than adding them).

- During the Final Word protocol, strategically use combinations of Conversation Cues to challenge students who need lighter support. For example:

- “Why do you think that?” (Goal 3)

- “What if \[the sentence were written this way instead\]?” (Goal 3)

- “How is what \_\_\_ said the same as/different from what \_\_\_ said?” (Goal 4)

- “How does this discussion add to your understanding of sentence variety?” (Goal 3)

For Heavier Support

- As a variation to the Final Word protocol of Work Time B, invite students who need heavier support to write down their thoughts before speaking, if needed. This allows additional processing time and may improve confidence and lead to discussion contributions that are more focused and efficient.

- During the Final Word protocol, strategically use combinations of Conversation Cues to help students who need heavier support be understood by their classmates. For example:

- “I’ll give you time to think and write or sketch.” (Goal 1)

- “Can you say more about that?” (Goal 1)

- “So, do you mean \_\_\_?” (Goal 1)

- “Can you add on to what your classmate said?” (Goal 4)

Closing and Assessment

A. Practice Sentence Variety – L.6.3a (5 minutes)

- Distribute **Exit Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 9**, and read the directions aloud. Direct students to complete the exit ticket.

- Collect the exit tickets to review for common misconceptions that can be addressed in a future lesson.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their habit of character focus for this lesson.

Homework

A. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread chapter 30 in *Two Roads* in preparation for studying this chapter in the next lesson.
