5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

RL.6.1, RL.6.4, RL.6.6, SL.6.1, L.6.4d, L.6.5c

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

**The “noble mission of this fine institution”** is to help the Indian. (from page 242 of *Two Roads* by Joseph Bruchac)

**Lesson 4 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after students read chapter 23 of *Two Roads* in Work Time A. If needed, extend this Mini Language Dive over two days to ensure sufficient engagement with the focus structure.

**Rationale**

- Module Guiding Question and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the guiding question **(Why were American Indian schools first established?)** by providing a direct statement that explains the mission of Challagi Indian Industrial School. The sentence also helps students address RL.6.6 by including strategically used quotation marks to illuminate Cal’s point of view toward Challagi’s purported mission, as well as RL.6.4, L.6.4d, and L.6.5c by featuring words with multiple meanings whose connotations impact the overall tone of the sentence (e.g., **noble**, **fine**). Supporting standards: RL.6.1, SL.6.1.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it includes two noun phrases that use a determiner + adjective + noun structure, with very carefully selected adjectives that impact the tone of the statement. It also uses an infinitive verb phrase as a noun and uses quotation marks to impose distance between the speaker and the message of the sentence.

- Transfer: determiner + adjective + noun / noun phrase + **of** + noun phrase = to use adjectives with a specific connotation to describe nouns in constructed response questions about point of view in the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence**: <u>The “noble mission of this fine institution”</u> is to help the Indian.**

- Ask:

“What is the gist of this sentence?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **The “noble mission of this fine institution”**

- Ask:

“Who can tell us what the word noble means? Does this word have a positive or negative connotation? What kinds of images does the word noble make you think of?” (The word noble means having qualities that people admire, like honesty or generosity. It has a positive connotation. The word noble seems formal and might make someone think about royalty or about people and places from long ago.)

- Display the following definitions of the word **fine**:

1.  acceptable or satisfactory; OK

2.  very good; deserving of praise or respect

3.  very thin or very sharp

- Ask:

“The word fine has many different meanings. Which of the following definitions best represents how this word is used in the sentence? What makes you think so?” (Definition B is best because the quote in this sentence is meant to explain how great Challagi is, and definition B is the most positive and relevant.)

- Draw students’ attention to the following two phrases: **The noble mission** and **this fine institution**.

- Ask:

“In terms of their structure, how are these two phrases similar?” (They are both noun phrases that follow a determiner + adjective + noun pattern.)

“What does the preposition of tell us about the relationship between these two noun phrases? How could we rewrite this chunk to show the same relationship in a different way?” (Of tells us that one noun phrase fits within, is part of, or belongs to the other; we could rewrite this chunk as, “This fine institution’s noble mission”.)

“What tone did Bruchac create by carefully selecting these two noun phrases?” (Bruchac creates a tone of formality and respect by selecting these two noun phrases.)

- Draw students’ attention to the quotation marks used in this chunk.

- Ask:

“What do the quotation marks tell us about this chunk?” (The quotation marks tell us that this is something that was originally written or said by someone else.)

“Whom or what do you think Cal is quoting in this chunk? What, in the chunk, makes you think so?” (He is probably quoting an administrator at Challagi, because this chunk is written in a formal way and presents a favorable view of Challagi.)

- If time allows, invite students to reread page 242 to discern the original speaker of this quote: Superintendent Morrell.

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **<u>The “noble mission of this fine institution”</u> is to help the Indian.**

- Then, display and read aloud the sentence that follows in the text, or invite students to read it from page 242 of their own books: “After the time I’ve spent here, though, it seems to me like the true purpose of this place is to wear the Indian out.”

- Ask:

“Based on this second sentence, how would you describe Cal’s point of view toward Challagi?” (Cal’s point of view toward Challagi is not positive; he feels like Challagi is trying to exploit or exhaust its students.)

“How does the author’s use of quotation marks in the Language Dive sentence help convey Cal’s point of view?” (The quotation marks emphasize the idea that the positive words noble and fine were said by someone else, and not by Cal; the quotation marks help convey the idea that Cal didn’t, and wouldn’t, say something like that himself.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question:  
Why were American Indian boarding schools first established?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

**Cal’s point of view toward Challagi is that the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ mission of that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

adjective adjective

**school is to wear the Indian out.**

- Ask:

“Use this frame to talk about Cal’s point of view in your own words with your partners. Complete this frame with adjectives whose connotations help convey this point of view.”

- Possible student answers:

> **Cal’s point of view toward Challagi is that the <u>unspoken</u> mission of this <u>oppressive</u> school is to wear the Indian out.**
