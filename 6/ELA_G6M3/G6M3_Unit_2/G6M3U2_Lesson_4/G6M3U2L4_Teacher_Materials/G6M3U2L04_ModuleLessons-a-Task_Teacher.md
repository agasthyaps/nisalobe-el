**Directions:** Using your Summary Planner: *Two Roads*, Chapter 22, write a summary of chapter 22. Remember, a summary should include: an introduction stating the chapter, a brief outline of what the text is about, a possible theme, key details from the text to support your theme, and no opinions or judgments.

Answers will vary, but may include: Chapter 22 of *Two Roads* contains five sections that show Cal in different settings with different adults. First, Cal is at school in Mr. Mallet’s class. Then he and Possum walk together to the harness shop when he also composes the letter to Pop. Next, Cal and Possum work in the harness shop with Mr. Handler. Then they go to get some of Cal’s money from Mr. Cash, the school bursar. Finally, the chapter ends with a trip to town so Cal can get new shoes at Mr. O’Boyle’s store. This chapter helps to convey the theme that one should respect all we encounter. In each of these sections, Cal acts with integrity and respect toward the adults, and even when he’s writing the letter to Pop. He is treated very differently by Mr. Mallet, Mr. Handler, Mr. Cash, and Mr. O’Boyle, but he never changes how he responds. He maintains his temper and acts respectfully, even when he is openly disrespected. This is shown at the end of the chapter: “I sigh inwardly at his attempt to talk the way some Indians do whose English isn’t good. But there’s no use in trying to correct him. I just nod my head and hand him three dollars.” This five-section structure lets the reader see Cal in all these different moments. As a result, we understand more about Cal and more about this theme of the novel.
