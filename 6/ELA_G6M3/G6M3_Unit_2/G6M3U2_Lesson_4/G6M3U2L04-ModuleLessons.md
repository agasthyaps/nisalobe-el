Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RL.6.1 – Opening A: Students use text evidence from chapter 22 of *Two Roads* to write a summary of the chapter.

- RL.6.2 – Opening A: Students compose an objective summary of chapter 22.

- RL.6.6 – Work Time A: Students explore connections among the authors’ points of view in different texts they have read. Then, they add to their Analyze Point of View: *Two Roads* note-catchers.

- L.6.1a – Work Time A: Students participate in a mini lesson to learn more about pronoun cases.

- L.6.1a – Closing and Assessment A: Students exercise their new learning about pronoun cases by completing a practice activity in which they determine the job and case of pronouns in sample sentences.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- An optional Mini Language Dive, intended for use after students read chapter 23 of *Two Roads* in Work Time A, is available in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Students who are particularly intrigued by the mechanics of sentence structure may be interested in sentence diagramming. Allow students to explore sentence diagramming to better understand how parts of speech interact to build increasingly complex sentences.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In Lesson 3, students read and analyzed chapter 22, working collaboratively to plan a summary of the chapter. Opening A in this lesson builds on that work by having students complete their summary, noting an emerging theme and providing text details to support their inferences.

- Previously in Unit 1, students practiced identifying and correctly using intensive and reflexive pronouns. In this lesson, students continue practicing Language standards by recognizing and using the correct pronoun in the appropriate case.

Support All Students

- Chapter 23 of *Two Roads* depicts the hard labor expected of students at American Indian boarding schools. Remind students of the excerpts from the Meriam Report they have already read that also discuss the exploitation of child labor and help students make connections between the two to support comprehension of the anchor text.

- The pronoun work of this and later lessons may offer unique challenges and opportunities for ELLs. Depending on the amount of formal English instruction they have received, especially grammar instruction, some ELLs may be more equipped than even their native English-speaking classmates to identify or name the job or case of pronouns in a sentence; other ELLs, with less experience formally studying English, may be especially confused by some of the pronoun terminology introduced in Work Time B. If feasible, invite ELLs to summarize, in writing or in small groups, their experiences formally studying grammar, especially pronouns. Based on the information gleaned, adapt instruction accordingly (e.g., supplement mini lessons with basic pronoun instruction; strategically pair students according to familiarity with pronouns; designate volunteer ELLs to be the “grammar experts” for the day). ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson features direct grammar instruction with teacher scaffolding through a mini lesson on pronoun case. Appropriate pronoun use is a key language goal for Grade 6 (L.6.1); this lesson has built-in opportunities for students to practice correctly determining a pronoun’s job and case in sample sentences.

- ELLs may find it challenging to effectively participate in the pronoun case mini lesson. Even if they have had direct pronoun instruction in past English-language lessons, or they generally use pronouns correctly now, the sophistication of the terminology used in the mini lesson could impede understanding. Consider inviting students to rewrite key terms from their Pronoun Case Notes (e.g., subjective case; predicate pronoun; indirect object) on chart paper and illustrate them with examples and images. Separating the components of the Pronoun Case Notes and enhancing them visually may help students feel less overwhelmed and more engaged, supporting their understanding the notes’ content.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.8, 6.II.A.1, 6.II.A.2, 6.II.B.4, and 6.II.C.6.

Assessment Guidance

- The pronoun instruction completed in this lesson assumes that students have some knowledge of subjects and predicates in sentences. Review these concepts as necessary to ensure clarity while students work to understand pronoun cases in Work Time B. Note also the color coding strategy used in Work Time B matches that which is used to code sentence chunk strips during Language Dives.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students read another chapter in the anchor text and add an additional entry to the Point of View note-catcher. They also examine the way in which chapter 24 helps to develop the setting and plot of the text, determine the connotative and figurative meanings of language used in an excerpt of the text, and analyze the way in which chapter 24 fits within the larger structure of the novel.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Write a Summary – RL.6.2 (10 minutes)

- Direct students to retrieve their **Summary Planner: *Two Roads***, **Chapter 22** from the previous lesson and to move back together with the partner with whom they completed the planner.

- Distribute **Write a Summary: *Two Roads***, **Chapter 22** to each student. Direct pairs to use their planner to compose a summary of chapter 22. Each student is responsible for completing a summary, although partners can think aloud together. Refer to the **Write a Summary: *Two Roads***, **Chapter 22 (example for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Collect summaries to review; plan to highlight strengths and clarify misconceptions in a future lesson.

- Using a preferred classroom routine, collect or review the answers to **Homework: Analyze Point of View: *Two Roads***, **Chapter 22**. Refer to **Homework: Analyze Point of View: *Two Roads***, **Chapter 22 (example for teacher reference)**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar to or the same as previous lessons. Invite students to choose a habit of character focus for themselves for this lesson.

Work Time

A. Read *Two Roads*, Chapter 23 – RL.6.6 (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Read chapter 23 of the text, using **Text Guide: *Two Roads*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students who are ready to read independently or in small groups should be released to this independence. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Students continue to identify how characters in the text demonstrate habits of character. Refer to the **Gist anchor chart: *Two Roads*** **(example for teacher reference)** and **chapter synopsis** as needed, as well as any other appropriate resources.

- Gist: Students at Challagi do hours of back-breaking labor every day. Cal takes a beating during boxing practice.

- Turn and Talk:

“What connections do you notice between the title of this chapter and Captain Pratt’s point of view in the speech we analyzed?” (The title of the chapter is “To Help Indians” and that, along with the stated mission of the school, aligns with the point of view expressed by Pratt in his speech.)

“What connections do you notice between Cal’s point of view on pages 242–244, and the Meriam Report?” (Cal’s experiences more closely align with the findings of the Meriam Report, both of which contrast with the chapter title and Captain Pratt’s point of view.)

- Refocus students, and direct them to retrieve their **Analyze Point of View: *Two Roads*** **note-catcher**. Instruct students to answer the questions at the bottom of the handout with comparisons for Pratt and the Meriam Report using the examples discussed. Using a total participation technique, invite students to share out their responses. Refer to **Analyze Point of View: *Two Roads*** **(example for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time A, after students read chapter 23 of *Two Roads*, invite students to participate in a Mini Language Dive in small groups to examine the way that word connotation and strategic punctuation use can be used to highlight a character’s point of view (RL.6.4, RL.6.6). This Mini Language Dive also gives students the opportunity to practice using dictionaries to clarify the precise definition of multiple-meaning words as they are used in the sentence (L.6.4d).

- As an extension to the Mini Language Dive and to help students draw connections across multiple texts, challenge students to compare the Language Dive sentence to the language in Captain Pratt’s speech, which students analyzed in Unit 1. The similarities in tone, style, and content may help students better contextualize the attitudes of Challagi’s Superintendent Morrell. Students may also wish to examine another sentence from page 242: “It is meant to teach the Indian a new modern way. To finally make him into a useful citizen after, as Superintendent Morrell puts it, ‘untold generations of meaningless savage life.’”

For Heavier Support

- As an extension to the Mini Language Dive of Work Time A, and in order to reinforce work with connotation (RL.6.4, L.6.5c), invite students to investigate the connotation of the words *mission* and *institution*. Provide students with the definitions of these words and their synonyms (e.g., *goal* and *organization*). Invite students to notice small differences among the pairs of words (i.e., *What is the difference in meaning between* institution *and* organization?). Then, students can use these differences in denotation to reflect on possible differences in connotation. Examples of words and denotations to include in this exercise are:

- *mission*: the ambition, goal, or job of an organization

- *goal*: something that you are trying to do or achieve

- *institution*: an established organization

- *organization*: a company, business, etc., that is formed for a particular purpose

Work Time

B. Mini Lesson: Pronoun Case – L.6.1a (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target for this section of the lesson:

“I can use specific steps to ensure that pronouns are in the proper case.”

- Distribute and display **Pronoun Case Notes**. Invite students to spend 3 minutes reading over the notes.

- After 3 minutes, ask students to Think-Pair-Share in response to the question:

“What wonderings do you have based on the notes?”

- Use **equity sticks** to call on three students to share one of their partner’s wonderings.

- Write student wonderings on a piece of **chart paper** that serves as a Parking Lot for questions.

- Explain to students that there are three pronoun cases: subjective, objective, and possessive. Each case has specific pronouns. In order to figure out if a pronoun is used correctly based on its case, students must learn the different functions or jobs of a pronoun.

- Direct students’ focus to the chart located in the Pronoun Case Notes.

- Turn and Talk:

“What are the different functions or jobs of a pronoun according to the chart? With which function are you least familiar?”

- Direct students’ focus to the examples located in the Pronoun Case Notes.

- Read the first example under the heading Subjective Case out loud. Use equity sticks to elicit answers. Ask:

“What makes the pronoun *I* the subject of the sentence?” (*I* is doing the action. *I* is the person sprinting across the field.)

- Highlight the subject *I* on the displayed Pronoun Case Notes with a blue colored marker or highlighter. Highlight the simple predicate *sprinted* in red colored marker or highlighter. Distribute **blue, red, and green colored markers or highlighters** to students and invite them to make the same annotations.

“Since *I* is doing the action and *I* is the subject of the sentence, what case is the pronoun?” (subjective case)

“Why wouldn’t the pronoun *me* be the correct pronoun to use in this sentence?” (The pronoun *me* is an objective case pronoun. The job of the pronoun in this sentence is to act as the subject of the sentence. If the pronoun is the subject of the sentence, then the pronoun used must be subjective case.)

- If students struggle to answer the question, use these questions to guide their thinking:

“What case is the pronoun *me*?” (objective)

“If a pronoun is the subject of a sentence, like in this example, can the pronoun be objective case?” (no)

- Direct students’ focus to the second example under the heading Subjective Case. Cold-call a student to read the sentence. Ask:

“What is the subject of the sentence?” (*captain*)

“What is the predicate of the sentence?” (*steered*)

“What is the pronoun that replaces the noun subject?” (*he*)

- Explain to the students that the pronoun *he* is located in the complete predicate of the sentence and the pronoun *he* is referring back to the subject, captain. Highlight in green the pronoun *he* on the displayed Pronoun Case Notes with a colored marker or highlighter. Draw an arrow to the noun it replaces *captain*. Highlight in red the complete predicate of the sentence *steered the ship he helped to build*.

- Explain that the job of the pronoun in this sentence is predicate pronoun. A predicate pronoun takes subjective case; therefore, the pronoun *he* is the proper pronoun to use in this sentence.

- Direct students’ focus to the first example under the heading Objective Case. Cold-call a student to read the sentence. Ask:

“What is the subject of the sentence?” (*babysitter*)

“What is the predicate of the sentence?” (*watched*)

“What is the pronoun in the sentence?” (*me*)

“Who/what was the babysitter watching? (The babysitter was watching me.)

- Explain to the students that the pronoun *me* is receiving the action of the verb, so the pronoun me is the direct object. A pronoun that is a direct object takes the objective case; therefore, the pronoun me is the proper pronoun to use in this sentence. Highlight the subject on the displayed Pronoun Case Notes with a blue colored marker or highlighter. Highlight the predicate *watching* with a red colored marker or highlighter. Draw an arrow from the simple predicate to the direct object receiving the action me. Highlight in green the pronoun *me*.

- Direct students’ focus to the first example under the heading Possessive Case. Cold-call a student to read the sentence. Ask:

“What is the subject of the sentence?” (*dog*)

“What is the predicate of the sentence?” (*is*  *destroying*)

“What is the pronoun in the sentence?” (*Your*)

“What does the pronoun show ownership of?” (*dog*)

“Why can’t we replace *your* with *you* in this sentence?” (*You* is a subjective or objective pronoun, not a possessive pronoun.)

- Highlight in blue the subject *dog*. Highlight in red the predicate *is destroying*. Highlight in green the pronoun *your*.

- Return to the Parking Lot questions and address any questions that were not answered through the mini lesson instruction.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“Why might it be important or useful to understand pronouns and their functions?” (Answers will vary, but may include: Understanding the nuances of language can help us to better appreciate well written sentences and texts and to become better writers ourselves. Expressing yourself clearly and concisely is essential in academic and professional work, as well as personal communications.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Closing and Assessment

A. Practice Pronoun Case – L.6.1a (5 minutes)

- Invite students to move to their predetermined triads.

- Distribute **Practice Pronoun Case** handout.

- Read the Focus Questions and Steps to Success on the Practice Pronoun Case handout.

- Invite students to answer questions 1–3 with their triad. Visit the triads and ask clarifying questions to guide student thinking.

- Regain student focus. Use the **Practice Pronoun Case (example for teacher reference)** to review the correct answers with the students. Model the think aloud process for the Steps to Success, as needed.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their habit of character focus for this lesson.

Homework

A. Preread Anchor Text
