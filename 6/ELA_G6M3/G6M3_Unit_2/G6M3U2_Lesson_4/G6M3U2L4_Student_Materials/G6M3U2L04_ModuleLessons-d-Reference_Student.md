- When a pronoun’s job in a sentence is the subject or a predicate pronoun, then the pronoun must be subjective case.

- When a pronoun’s job in a sentence is a direct object, indirect object, or object of a preposition, then the pronoun must be objective case.

- When a pronoun’s job in a sentence is to show ownership, then the pronoun must be possessive case.

**Subjective Case**

**Subject:** the pronoun that does the action

**Example: I** sprinted across the field.

**Predicate Pronoun:** a pronoun that renames or identifies the subject

**Example:** The captain steered the ship **he** helped to build.

**Objective Case**

**Direct Object:** the pronoun that receives the action of a verb

**Example:** The babysitter watched **me** eat the entire cake.

**Indirect Object:** the pronoun that receives the direct object

**Example:** Pamela baked **us** a delicious apple pie.

**Object of a Preposition:** the pronoun that comes after a preposition

**Example:** The award was given to **her**.

**Possessive Case**

In the possessive case, a pronoun is showing ownership of something. Something belongs to the pronoun.

**Example: Your** dog is destroying **my** garden!
