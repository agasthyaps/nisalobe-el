Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- The End of Unit 3 Assessment is a three-part speaking and listening assessment. In Parts I and II, students record two versions of their performance task contribution and then reflect on and self-assess each for their volume, pronunciation, and language use. Students use their observations about their first attempt to improve their performance on the second attempt. In Part III, they listen to a peer’s second recording and reflect on and paraphrase the content and assess their peer’s volume, pronunciation, and language use in that second performance. Teachers review the second recording, both self-assessments, and the peer assessment to assess each student’s speaking and listening. Teachers have the option of also assessing pronouns and sentence variety via the recordings. (RI.6.1, RI.6.6, SL.6.2, SL.6.6, L.6.3b, and L.6.6 \[optional L.6.1)

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- The process of listening to, reflecting upon, and re-recording one’s own speech is beneficial for all students, especially ELLs, who may have limited opportunities to speak aloud in academic English for extended periods of time. Consider creating additional opportunities to build upon this learning. As an extension to the end of unit assessment, invite students to record themselves reading aloud select paragraphs of their literary argument essays, which they wrote during the Mid-Unit 3 Assessments. Students can follow the same process of recording themselves reading aloud, reflecting on their volume and pronunciation, and then re-recording to improve these elements of their speech. For an added challenge, students can reflect on and seek to improve other related elements of their speech, such as their pausing patterns or enunciation. ▲

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students wrote the preface and reflection that will frame their selected text in the end of unit assessment recording. Also, in Unit 2, Lesson 12, students practiced using their preferred, available recording technology to record themselves reading the narrative letters they wrote.

Support All Students

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study, as well as the goals of the assessment.

- Working with classmates to give and receive presentation feedback may make some students feel uncomfortable. Consider modeling appropriate, kind, and helpful stars and steps, or providing specific sentence frames that clarify feedback expectations.

- Some students, especially ELLs, may feel especially nervous at the prospect of reading a text aloud and playing it back for others to hear. Offering additional speaking support to ELLs may help assuage some of these concerns. The goal of speaking tips should not be to hide accent, but rather to improve enunciation and pacing, increase speaking volume, and/or encourage other public speaking strategies that help students develop confidence (e.g., using note-cards, speaking slower than may seem necessary). ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson invites students to complete assessment tasks for which they have spent previous lessons carefully preparing. Students record their performance task contributions, which include a text they selected in Lesson 10 and a preface and reflection they wrote in Lesson 11. The assessment has built-in opportunities for reflection and revision, which is especially useful for ELLs who may feel self-conscious about their speaking skills. Students will share these recordings during the Voices of American Indian Boarding Schools Audio Museum of the following lesson. The connectedness of these lessons is supportive of ELLs because it clarifies task purpose, allows for incremental learning and synthesis, and supports students’ understanding of relationships across skills and tasks.

- ELLs may find it challenging to independently complete the end of unit assessment without scaffolding, especially if they feel particularly uncomfortable speaking aloud. Point out the ways in which the end of unit assessment invites reflection and revision. Encourage students to do their best, and assure them that they will continue learning together after the assessment.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.4, 6.I.B.5, 6.I.B.7, 6.I.B.8, 6.I.B.12, 6.II.A.1, 6.II.A.2, 6.II.B.5, 6.II.C.6, and 6.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- All assessment materials (the student and teacher versions of End of Unit 3 Assessment: Rehearse and Refine Performance Task Recording) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- The lesson is written with each part of the assessment broken down in separate steps. Adjust as necessary based on student needs and classroom resources.

- Remind students during Part III that they are not only exchanging their recordings with their partner but also their Performance Task Recording Planner. Their partner needs to be able to follow along with the recorded narrative by seeing a written version of the text excerpt that is the focus of the recording and reflection.

- When assessing and providing feedback on this assessment, use the teacher answer key and sample student responses (see Assessment Overview and Resources) to help complete students’ Track Progress recording form.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students participate in the audio museum and reflect on the module as a whole.

- Students’ End of Unit 3 Assessments will be returned in Module 4, Lesson 5 with feedback.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Return Mid-Unit 3 Assessment – W.6.10 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 12**. Students will also need their **Mid-Unit 3 Assessment with feedback**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar to or the same as previous lessons.

Work Time

A. End-of-Unit 3 Assessment: Part I (10 minutes)

- Invite students to retrieve the following materials. Refer to the examples for teacher reference of each as needed while students work:

- **Performance Task Recording Planner**

- **Audio Museum: Performance Task directions**

- **Analyze Model Performance Task Recording note-catcher**

- **Model Performance Task Recording Planner**

- Display and distribute the **Mid-Unit 3 Assessment: Rehearse and Refine Performance Task Recording**.

- Invite students to follow along, reading silently in their heads, while the directions for each part of the assessment are read aloud. Make sure students understand the assessment directions; paraphrase some instructions, if needed. ▲

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence. Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart** and review perseverance and what this looks and sounds like. Remind students that as they will be recording, listening, and writing independently, they may need to practice perseverance.

- Invite students to begin Part I of the assessment, which asks them to record their performance task contribution. They then listen to the recording and reflect on and self-assess their recording.

- While students are working on this part of the assessment, circulate to monitor their progress. Remind students when time for this part is almost elapsed.

For Lighter Support

- Before the assessment of Work Times A–C, underline key vocabulary in the assessment directions and prompt and read aloud together as a class to ensure that students understand each task included in the assessment. Invite students who need lighter support to restate or clarify information for students who need heavier support.

For Heavier Support

- Display a “map” of the assessment(s) to reference while explaining directions to the end of unit assessment. This will reduce ambiguity and give students a clearer picture of what they can expect so they can better allocate their time and attentional resources. Provide students with colored pencils or highlighters so that they can mark up the map as needed. Example:

- Record your performance task (your preface, selected text, and reflection).

- Listen to your recording. Evaluate your volume, your pronunciation, and your language use. Describe a star and a step.

- Record your performance task again. Try to improve your volume, your pronunciation, and your language use.

- Listen to your second recording. Evaluate it again. Locate another star and step.

- Listen to a classmate’s recording. Reflect on the recording and answer questions about its content.

Work Time

B. End of Unit 3 Assessment: Part II (10 minutes)

- Reconvene the students and instruct them to continue to Part II of the assessment. This part asks them to use their observations to improve their performance as they create a second recording of their performance task. They then listen to that second recording and again reflect on and self-assess.

- While students are working on this part of the assessment, circulate to monitor their progress. Remind students when time for this part is almost elapsed.

Work Time

C. End of Unit 3 Assessment: Part III (15 minutes)

- Reconvene the students and instruct them to continue to Part III of the assessment. This part asks students to listen to their partner’s second recording and then reflect on and assess their recording.

- Have students exchange recordings and their Performance Task Recording Planners with their partner and complete this part.

- While students are working on this part of the assessment, circulate to monitor their progress. Remind students when time for this part is almost elapsed.

- Explain that students will use the feedback from their peers to finalize their performance task recording for inclusion in the audio museum in the next lesson. Remind students that their recording needs to be ready to be shared in Lesson 13. Provide students who are unable to work on the recording at home alternative opportunities to work on the recording during school hours.

- Refer to **End of Unit 3 Assessment: Rehearse and Refine Performance Task Recording (example for teacher reference)** and the **Grade 6 Speaking and Listening Recording Sheet** to assess completed recordings after students have finished all parts of the assessment, including their self-reflection, re-recording, and peer review.

Closing and Assessment

A. Assessment Debrief (5 minutes)

- Give students specific, positive feedback on their completion of the End of Unit 3 Assessment: Rehearse and Refine Performance Task Recording.

- Ask students to share what parts of the assessment were challenging for them and why and how they persevered. Ask students to share their successes on the assessment.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Homework

A. Performance Task Recording (optional)

- Students finalize their performance task recordings for the audio museum in the next lesson.
