**Part III**

**Directions:** Listen to your partner’s second recording. Then reflect on and assess their recording by responding to the items below. Refer to your partner’s planner and source text as needed when responding.

**Introduction and Reading Sections** (SL.6.2)

What is the context?

Answers will vary, but may include: Students at the boarding school were forced to change their names to sound less Indian.

Who is the writer of the excerpt?

Answers will vary, but may include: Chief Luther Standing Bear

What are the key ideas in the excerpt?

Answers will vary, but may include: Students were required to give up their Indian names and choose English names instead. Students did not understand the change that was being forced upon them. Taking away someone’s name was one of the ways that students were stripped of their identity.

**Reflection Section** (RI.6.1, RI.6.6, SL.6.2)

What perspective or point of view toward the experience of the boarding schools is being conveyed in the excerpt? What words from the excerpt helped me determine that point of view?

Answers will vary, but may include: Luther Standing Bear’s point of view toward the boarding schools was that their goal was to erase their Indian culture by erasing their language. This was made clear when Luther Standing Bear said that forbidding students from using their “mother language” was “robbing the Indian” and American of “a rich heritage.”

Source: Standing Bear, Luther. *My People the Sioux*. Houghton Mifflin Co., 1928.

Why is the excerpt meaningful?

Answers will vary, but may include: The excerpt is meaningful because it shows how one of the choices of the boarding schools had both short-term and long-term effects. During the short-term, students had to change their name at school. For the long-term, the rule to not speak one’s home language erases that part of a person’s identity and culture.

What can we learn from the excerpt?

Answers will vary, but may include: From this excerpt, we can learn how important it is to respect a person’s home language and show them respect by using their proper name.

How does this perspective compare and contrast with the perspective of my own excerpt? Of the module texts?

Answers will vary.
