Copy one checklist for each discussion group. Record your observations using the following key:

1 = Beginning 2 = Developing 3 = Proficient 4 = Advanced

[^1]: Assessment of SL.6.2 is done through the written responses on Part III of the assessment after listening to their peer’s recording.

[^2]: Assessment of Conventions of Standard English is optional for this assessment as these are assessed in End of Unit 1 and End of Unit 3 Assessments. This provides another opportunity to determine student progress towards these standards if desired or warranted.
