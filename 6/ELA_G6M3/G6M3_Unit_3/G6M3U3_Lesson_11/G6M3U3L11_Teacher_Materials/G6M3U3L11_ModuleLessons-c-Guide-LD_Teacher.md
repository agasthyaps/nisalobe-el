(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

One way they did this was by forcing the students to change their names, **as Standing Bear explains in this excerpt from a personal narrative** (from preface of the Model Performance Task Recording).

Launch

As time allows, help students revisit their learning from past Language Dives and connect it to current work. The Language Dive sentence from Module 2, Unit 3, Lesson 6 contains a “**by** + (verb + **-ing**)” structure, which is used again in the current Language Dive sentence (**by forcing the students to change their names**). Though this structure is not the focus of the current Dive, revisiting past work with this structure may support their understanding of this sentence. Also, the Language Dive of Module 1, Unit 3, Lesson 8 centered around the use of the word **as** as a conjunction that indicates when something is taking place (“As Annabeth and I were spreading a picnic blanket”); the focus structure in the current Language Dive also uses the conjunction **as**, but instead as a means to compare. See Lesson 11 of the Teacher’s Guide for English Language Learners for more specific suggestions on how to incorporate past work into this Dive.

One way they did this

Deconstruct

- Ask:

“What pronouns do you see in this chunk?” (they; this.)

- Students can listen again to the preceding sentence in the model recording to help them answer this question: “One of the main objectives of the schools was to wipe away the students’ tribal identities.”

“What does the pronoun this refer to in this chunk? How do you know?” (This refers to the wiping away of the students’ tribal identities because that was the thing or idea expressed most recently in the previous sentence.)

“Whom or what does the pronoun they refer to? How do you know?” (They appears to refer to the schools because that is what makes the most sense in the chunk. The schools are what would wipe away the tribal identities.)

“In what ways is the antecedent for the pronoun they vague or ambiguous?” (They refers to a plural noun, but the most recent plural noun before this chunk is tribal identities. However, this cannot be the antecedent, because saying “One way the tribal identities wiped away the students’ tribal identities” doesn’t make sense.)

“How can we revise this chunk to make its use of pronouns more effective?”) You can rewrite this chunk on your note-catchers.) Step 3

was by forcing the students to change  
their names,

Deconstruct

- **forcing**

“What does the author’s word choice tell us about this chunk?” (That students changed their names against their will; that students did not want to change their names, but the schools made them do it.)

“Why did the schools force students to change their names?” (Because the schools wanted students to have more Americanized names; the schools wanted to erase the Indian identity of their students, and names carry a great deal of identity information.)

as Standing Bear explains in this excerpt from a personal narrative.

Deconstruct: Focus Structure

- **as Standing Bear explains**

“What is the function of as in as Standing Bear explains? What other words could we use instead?” (As in this sentence means something like ‘like’; it is something like a comparison word; is telling us that what Standing Bear explains is similar to what was described before. \[conjunction\])

- **in this excerpt from a personal narrative**

“Which excerpt is the speaker talking about?” (The one they are about to read.)

“What if this chunk had been written as in that excerpt from the personal narrative? How would the meaning be different?” (The words that and the indicate that the listener already knows which excerpt and narrative the speaker is talking about.)

- **Students can use Conversation Cues as they discuss. To provide heavier support, display a suggested sequence, such as the one below:**

- Goal 1: Let’s take time to think and write or sketch.

- Goal 1: Can you say more about that?

- Goal 2: Who can tell us what your classmate said in your own words?

- Goal 4: Who can add on to what your classmate said?

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Students can complete this sentence frame to highlight a familiar phrase or quote frequently said by someone else (e.g., a celebrity; a teacher; a family member)  Step 4

> As \_\_\_\_ says, “\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.” (As my grandma says, ‘It’s the journey, not the destination, that matters.’)

- To provide lighter support: “Can you add to the as phrase with additional contextual information? For example, “As **<u>my mother</u>** says **<u>when she sits down to eat</u>** . . .”

- To provide heavier support: Students can use an adapted sentence frame to teach a key phrase in their home languages. For example, “As Korean speakers say when they greet a friend, ‘\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_!’” or “As we say in Bangladesh, ‘\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_,’” or ‘Welcome!’”

One way they did this was by forcing  
the students to change their names, as Standing Bear explains in this excerpt  
from a personal narrative.

Reconstruct

- Ask:

“What is the relationship between this sentence and the next part of the model recording?” (This sentence previews the selected text, which the speaker reads aloud in the next part of the model recording.)

“How does the speaker connect this sentence to the information presented before it and to the information that comes after it?” (The speaker uses pronouns to refer back to something mentioned in the previous sentence. Then, the speaker uses the conjunction as to compare new information to what comes next \[as Standing Bear explains in this excerpt from a personal narrative, previewing for listeners what they can expect.\])

- Students can participate in a physical activity to engage with the role of this sentence as a transitional one in the recording. They can use their thumbs to point behind them as they read the first chunk, “one way they did this,” to signal something that was previously mentioned. They can point their fingers to the ground as they read the second chunk, “was by forcing students to change their names,” to signal that a new piece of information is being added now. They can point ahead to the future as they read the third chunk, “as Standing Bear explains in this excerpt from a personal narrative,” which refers to something coming next in the text. Alternatively, students can be invited to sketch the roles of and relationships among these chunks.

“How might this structure help us write our own prefaces for the model recording?” (Answers will vary, but may include: that this structure can be used to illustrate a transition from one section of the recording to another.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target:  
I can analyze the ‘context for reading’ sentence from the model performance task preface?” (Answers will vary, but may include: that the sentence featured in this Language Dive includes context about the author and the content of the text included in the model recording.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question:  
What kinds of experiences did students have at American Indian boarding schools?” (Answers will vary, but may include: that this sentence describes an experience that was common at American Indian boarding schools: the experience of having your name stripped from you.)

Practice (Sentence)

- Students can complete the following frame with information about their own selected texts. They can use the complete sentence in their own prefaces, which they write in Work Time B.

> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, as \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ explains in this excerpt from/about \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
>
> (Students often had their hair forcibly cut at American Indian boarding schools, as Zitkala-Sa explains in this excerpt from a personal narrative.)  Step 5

- To provide lighter support: “What if we divide this sentence into two or more sentences? What do we have to remove or change?”

- To provide heavier support: Invite students to discuss the meaning of the sentence in home language groups. Add the nouns in students’ home languages to the Parts of Speech anchor chart.
