Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- L.6.1d – Work Time A: Students participate in a Language Dive to examine a sentence from the preface of the model performance task recording. They analyze pronouns and their antecedents and practice revising a vague antecedent.

- L.6.3a – Work Time A: During the Language Dive, students analyze the way in which subordinate clauses can be added to a sentence to improve meaning and variety.

- W.6.4 – Work Time B: Students produce clear and coherent prefaces and reflections to frame their selected text in their performance task recording.

- W.6.10 – Work Time B: Students write a preface and a reflection, noting the distinct purposes of each.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- The Language Dives of Module 3 have been increasingly student-led. Challenge students to take full ownership of the Language Dive process by developing their own Language Dive based on a key sentence from the reflection section of the model performance task recording. Students can work in small groups to select a sentence from the reflection, separate it into chunks, develop questions, and generate a practice structure that can be manipulated and applied to other contexts. Then, groups can be mixed up, and students can lead one another through the Language Dives their groups created. This Language Dive will accompany the Language Dive featured in this lesson, which isolates a sentence from the preface of the recording. The process of generating their own Language Dives will clarify expectations of the reflection section of the recording for students, reinforce work with W.6.4 and W.6.10, and strengthen students’ abilities to independently recognize language structures. ▲

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students analyzed a model performance task recording, noting the purpose and impact of the preface and reflection included in the recording. In this lesson, students participate in a Language Dive to more deeply explore the language used in the model preface. Then, students write their own preface and reflection based on the texts that they selected in the previous lesson.

Support All Students

- Students may need additional support working independently to write their preface and reflection. Consider grouping those who may find this work especially challenging and providing additional guidance.

- It may be challenging for some students to stay on task for an extended period of time. Help students break up the time by encouraging them to set a series of small goals to track their progress and maintain their pace.

- To support ELLs, this lesson continues to prepare students for successful participation in the performance task of Lesson 13. Students engage in a Language Dive that features a sentence from the preface of the model performance task recording. Through the Dive, students learn how to effectively introduce listeners to the texts they have selected to share. The Practice frame of the Language Dive guides students in producing a sentence that can be used in their own prefaces, which they write immediately following the Language Dive.

- As the Language Dive focuses on the preface, not the reflection, ELLs may find it challenging to write a reflection that effectively concludes their recording. Remind students that the reflection is meant to express personal opinions and highlight personal impact; there’s no right or wrong answer. Consider inviting students to first approach the reflection as a QuickWrite. Set a timer to 5 minutes and challenge students to write without stopping. Then, students review, polish, and add to their original ideas. This process may help ELLs feel less stuck or less preoccupied with correctness.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.4, 6.I.B.5, 6.I.B.7, 6.I.B.8, 6.I.B.12, 6.II.A.1, 6.II.A.2, 6.II.B.5, 6.II.C.6, and 6.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- This is the last lesson before the End of Unit 3 Assessment. Ensure students know how to use the chosen recording application so they can focus on their presentation rather than technology challenges.

- Consider providing non-examples of presentations to help students understand the criteria they will be showcasing in their own recordings for the end of unit assessment.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will complete the End of Unit 3 Assessment. They will record themselves reading aloud their preface, their selected text, and their reflection. After reflecting on their own presentations, students will have the opportunity to re-record a more polished version of their work. Students will share feedback with a partner on the language and content of the second, more polished recordings. These recordings will be featured in the Voices of American Indian Boarding Schools Audio Museum performance task of Lesson 13.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Determine the way in which the model recording preface will be shared with students during Work Time A. Speakers or another external audio system can be used to project the model recording to the whole class. The model recording may be accessed via http://eled.org/6m3-modelperformancetask.

- Preview the Language Dive Guide: Model Recording Preface, the Language Dive: Model Recording Preface Sentence Chunk Chart, and the Language Dive: Model Recording Preface note-catcher to become familiar with what will be required of students.

- Determine how visitors will listen to the recordings. If using, preview QR code generator websites to use for linking to audio files.

- Create a model of the types of visuals one might display at their listening station, such as images of the boarding schools or of the author of the text chosen to be recorded.

- Review the student tasks and example answers to get familiar with what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time A: Prepare the desired technology to share the model recording. The model recording may be accessed via http://eled.org/6m3-modelperformancetask.

- Work Time B: Set up computers or tablets with access to the internet for students who are ready to begin gathering brief biographical context for their chosen performance task reading.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.6.10 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 11.**

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar to or the same as previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Language Dive: Model Recording Preface – L.6.3a (10 minutes)

- Tell students they will now participate in a Language Dive to analyze a transitional statement from the preface of the model recording.

- Display the **Questions We Can Ask during a Language Dive anchor chart**. Refer to the **Questions We Can Ask during a Language Dive anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Replay the preface section of the **Model Recording**, which students analyzed in the previous lesson. Remind students that, for homework in the previous lesson, they began conducting research to find these biographical details for the author of their chosen text. They should continue that work during this lesson and for homework to complete that section of their own **Performance Task Recording Planner**.

- Focus students on this sentence from the preface:

- One way they did this was by forcing the students to change their names, as Standing Bear explains in this excerpt from a personal narrative.

- Use the **Language Dive Guide: Model Recording Preface** and the **Language Dive: Model Recording Preface Sentence Chunk Chart** to guide students through a Language Dive conversation about the sentence. Distribute and display the **Language Dive: Model Recording Preface note-catcher**, and the **Language Dive: Model Recording Preface sentence chunk strips**. Refer to the **Language Dive: Model Recording Preface note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- As an extension to the Language Dive of Work Time A, invite students to revisit Language Dives from previous modules to draw connections and reinforce learning. Students who need lighter support can return to the Language Dive from Module 1, Unit 3, Lesson 8, which also included the word *as*, but for a different purpose (i.e., to indicate that two things were happening at the same time, rather than to signal a comparison). Students can use an online learner’s dictionary to more deeply explore the different ways that the word *as* can be used. Provide sentences from *Two Roads* and invite students to use the learner’s dictionary to help them determine the meaning and function of the word as in each context. For example:

- “ . . . those unforgiving steel wheels that’ll lop off a leg as easy as a knife cutting through butter” (46–47) \[ *as* is being used to make a comparison.\]

- “There’s a small assortment of clothes on the first table as we walk in the door” (190) \[ *as* is being used to show that two things are happening at the same time.\]

- “Then he shakes water from his hands . . . as if he’s offering the ground some of the water” (24) \[ *as* to introduce a simile.\]

For Heavier Support

- As an extension to the Language Dive of Work Time A, invite students to revisit Language Dives from previous modules to draw connections and reinforce learning. Students who need heavier support can return to the Language Dive from Module 2, Unit 3, Lesson 6, which included a *by* + verb *-ing* clause in its focus structure. Students can compare this past focus structure to a similar structure in the current Dive: *by forcing the students to change their names*. Provide relevant sentence frames, with gradually decreased scaffolding, for students to complete as practice with this structure. For example:

- By reviewing this structure, I \_\_\_\_\_.

- One way I improve my grammar is by \_\_\_\_\_.

- By \_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_.

Work Time

B. Write Preface and Reflection – W.6.4, W.6.10 (25 minutes)

- Explain that students will now write a preface and reflection to frame their selected text, using the Performance Task Recording Planners that they received in the previous lesson. Make sure students understand that they do not have to rewrite their selected texts in the Reading with Bibliographic Source Information section of the table; however, a space is available for them if they wish to cut out their text and tape or glue it into the chart.

- Invite students to begin writing. As students work, circulate to monitor and support them as needed. Provide **computers or tablets** with access to the internet for students to gather biographical details about their author and context about the school they attended. Encourage them to refer to their **Model Performance Task Recording Planners** from the previous lesson as they write.

- If students finish early, encourage them to pair up and practice reading their preface and reflection aloud in preparation for the recording in the following lesson.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Closing and Assessment

A. Prepare Listening Station (5 minutes)

- Explain that for students to share their recordings, they will need to set up listening stations for their guests.

- Guide students through the process for creating listening stations. If applicable, display a website where students can generate QR codes that guests can scan to get access to the recording file, such as http://eled.org/0212.

- Turn and Talk:

“Besides a link to the recording, what else might you want to include at your listening station to engage guests more?” (Answers will vary, but may include: An image of the person whose narrative is being shared. An image of the boarding schools like the ones we analyzed in Unit 1.)

- Guide students to devise a plan for creating the other materials that will be displayed at their listening station.

- Remind students that they will work on recording and refining their own presentations and also reflecting on and giving feedback to a peer during the end of unit assessment in the next lesson.

For Lighter Support

- In the following lesson, students will record their performance task recordings. As part of the end of unit assessment, students will reflect on their and a partner’s speaking volume, pronunciation, and language use. To help prepare students who need lighter support, invite them to listen again to select sentences from the model performance task recording and work with partners to discuss their answers to the following questions:

- What do you notice about the speaker’s intonation in this sentence? When does it rise or fall?

- What words does the speaker emphasize? What words does the speaker say quickly?

- Can you repeat the same sentence with a similar intonation?

- How does this activity support your understanding of intonation? How might this help you when recording your performance task in the next lesson?
