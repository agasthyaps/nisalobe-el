<p>After years of living on the road with his son, Cal, camping and hopping trains, Pop tells Cal that he plans to go to Washington, DC. In Joseph Bruchac’s historical fiction novel, <em>Two Roads,</em> Pop is a war veteran and, like many other veterans at that time, he is being mistreated by the government. Pop wants to participate in a large campaign to help veterans receive the money that the government owes them for their service. Pop warns Cal that the campaign may be dangerous and that Cal is “not ready yet to be part of any army” like the one fighting in Washington (94). Therefore, Cal cannot join him. Instead, Cal must attend Challagi Indian School while Pop is away. Pop says that this will also be a good opportunity for Cal to continue his education and make friends. Although Cal feels nervous and sad that he cannot go with his father, Pop should not bring Cal to Washington with him. The events in Washington are not appropriate for Cal to attend, and spending some time at Challagi is a better alternative for him.</p>

<p>The first reason why Pop should not bring Cal to Washington is that Cal is too young to participate in the events of this important campaign. Pop will be protesting with thousands of other veterans in a big city. The veterans are coming together as “an army,” fighting for their money and their rights (94). Pop warns Cal that the campaign “might be dangerous” (59). Cal knows a lot about the dangers of the road, but the dangers of this campaign will be different. Pop wants Cal to be safe while he is gone. If Pop brings Cal to Washington with him, he will worry about Cal’s physical and emotional safety. If Cal goes to Challagi instead, Pop will know that he is “safe with three hots and a cot” (94). This will help Pop focus on the goals of the campaign. This fight is not for children.</p>

<p>The second reason why it is best for Cal to stay behind is because Challagi may actually be good for Cal. Even though Pop has some bad memories of the discipline at Challagi, the other Creek boys he met at Challagi “were some of the best buddies [he] ever had” (107). Cal does not have any friends or other family left, so meeting other kids could be good for him. At Challagi, Cal will also get to have a real education. He already loves to read, and now he can attend all kinds of academic and industrial classes. Plus, even if Cal is unhappy at Challagi, he will only be there temporarily. Pop plans to return in a few months to get Cal and buy a house for them. Even Cal agrees that “a man can stand almost anything as long as it’s not forever” (121). Challagi might just wind up being good for Cal.</p>

<p>Cal and Pop certainly make a good team, and they will miss each other a lot. Still, it is better for both of them if Pop does not bring Cal to Washington. Pop has two goals: he wants to help veterans get what they deserve, and he wants Cal to be safe and educated. The best way for Pop to accomplish both of these goals is to go to Washington alone, without Cal. They will reunite soon after and begin a better life.</p>
