English Language Learners: Grade 6: Module 3: Unit 3: Teaching Notes

Literary Argument Writing: Gather Evidence and Reflect on Multiple Perspectives

Teaching Notes for Unit 3

Prioritize Lessons for Classrooms with Many English Language Learners

To prepare for the mid-unit assessment, prioritize and expand instruction in Lesson 1, in which students use the familiar Painted Essay® structure to analyze the function of individual sentences and paragraphs in the model literary argument essay; and in Lesson 7, in which students gather evidence for and plan the independent literary argument essays that they will write during the mid-unit assessment of the following lessons. The Lesson 3 Language Dive is also especially critical for ELLs as they facilitate close examination of a main claim statement after which students can model their own main claims. Finally, prioritize Lesson 11, which is devoted to the planning of students’ performance task recordings. ELLs, especially, may benefit from additional time to write their prefaces and reflections and practice reading them and their selected readings aloud.

Language Dives

In Lessons 3 and 11, students participate in Language Dives that prepare them to effectively complete major tasks in the module. In Lesson 3, students analyze the main claim of the model literary argument essay. The Practice section of this Language Dive provides a sentence frame that students can complete to present the main claims in their own collaborative and independent literary argument essays. In Lesson 11, students examine a sentence from the preface of the model performance task recording. Students produce a similar sentence for use in the prefaces of their own performance task recordings in the following lesson. A Language Dive empowers students to analyze, understand, and use the language of academic sentences, which often seems opaque to students. During a Language Dive, students slow down for 10–20 minutes to have a conversation about the meaning, purpose, and structure of a compelling sentence from a complex text or from a learning target, checklist, or rubric included in the curriculum. Following the engaging deconstruct-reconstruct-practice routine of the Language Dive, students play with the smallest “chunks” of the sentence, interpreting them, rearranging them, or using them to talk about their own lives. As a result of paying close attention to how language works, all students begin to acquire the necessary facility with academic English, and ELLs foster their overall language ability. A consistent Language Dive routine is critical in helping all students learn how to decipher complex sentences and write their own.

Most Language Dives implicitly address a wide range of Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening, and Language standards. Once comfortable with Language Dives, supplement the focus standards in a particular Language Dive with additional standards to meet students’ needs. Note that the Rationale section of each Language Dive also identifies supporting standards that are explicitly addressed but are not the main focus of the Language Dive.

Note that the Language Dive guides have been condensed in Module 3 as a way to reduce the amount of reading expected of teachers. Refer to the general best practices laid out in the Module 1 Language Dive guides.

Language Chunk Wall

Continue to use a “Language Chunk Wall” to extend students’ capacity to use Language Dive structures. The Language Chunk Wall is an area in the classroom where students can display and categorize the academic phrases discussed in each Language Dive. At the end of each Language Dive, students are invited to place the Language Dive sentence chunk strips on the Language Chunk Wall into corresponding categories, such as “Nouns and Noun Phrases” or “Linking Language.” See each Language Dive for suggested categories. Color-coding each category for additional support. Examples: blue for nouns, pronouns, and subjects; red for predicates and verbs; yellow for adjectives; and green for adverbs, prepositions, and conjunctions. Students can then refer to the wall during subsequent speaking and writing tasks.

Mini Language Dives

Students have an opportunity to participate in Mini Language Dives beginning in Module 2, Unit 1. Mini Language Dives have the same overall purpose and follow the same general process as full Language Dives, but are condensed to 5 minutes, narrowing students’ attention on deconstructing the focus structure, reconstructing the sentence, and practicing the focus structure. Mini Language Dives give ELLs additional support in building language, literacy skills, and habits of mind. Mini Language Dives are most often optional and can be found in the corresponding lessons within this guide. When required for all students, Mini Language Dives are built into the body of the core lessons. In this unit, optional Mini Language Dives appear in Lessons 4, 5, and 6. These Mini Language Dives further support students’ understanding of the model literary essay by inviting analysis of sentences from the essay’s Proof Paragraphs and conclusion.

Diversity and Inclusion

Investigate the routines, practices, rituals, beliefs, norms, and experiences that are important to ELLs and their families. Integrate this background into the classroom as students engage with texts. Consider the values and narratives embedded in class texts and try to anticipate their relevance to ELLs. As students select texts to read and reflect upon as part of their performance task recordings, they may encounter descriptions of students suffering at American Indian boarding schools. Foster inclusive action by creating space for students to express their feelings about sensitive content embedded in the texts, knowing that these discussions may help create equity, amplify students’ voices, or unearth trauma. Consult with a guidance counselor, school social worker, or ESL teacher for further investigation of diversity and inclusion.

Conversation Cues

Encourage productive and equitable conversation with Conversation Cues, which are questions to ask students that help achieve four goals:

- (Goal 1) encourage all students to talk and be understood;

- (Goal 2) listen carefully to one another and seek to understand;

- (Goal 3) deepen thinking; and

- (Goal 4) think with others to expand the conversation (adapted from Michaels, Sarah, and Cathy O’Connor. *Talk Science Primer*. TERC, 2012. http://inquiryproject.terc.edu/shared/pd/TalkScience_Primer.pdf. Based on Chapin, S., O’Connor, C., and N. Anderson. \[2009\]. *Classroom Discussions: Using Math Talk to Help Students Learn, Grades K–6*. Second Edition. Math Solutions Publications).

Refer to the Tools Page (http://eled.org/tools) for the complete set of cues. Goal 1 Conversation Cues were introduced in Module 1, Unit 1; Goal 2 Conversation Cues were introduced in Module 1, Unit 3; Goal 3 Conversation Cues were introduced in Module 2, Unit 2, and Goal 4 Conversation Cues were introduced in Module 3, Unit 1. Suggestions for integrating Conversation Cues into instruction are presented across lessons. For ELLs, Conversation Cues are especially critical because they improve language processing abilities and increase engagement and participation.

Use Conversation Cues as often as possible to gradually release thinking and expression of ideas to students; avoid using Conversation Cues as a way of searching for the “right” answer. Students often struggle to create productive and equitable conversation during Turn and Talk or Think-Pair-Share protocols; Conversation Cues can make the difference.

Consider this model transcription from a classroom where about 85% of students are ELLs. The teacher is supporting students to build their ideas about the choice an author made when writing this sentence about an athlete’s factors for success: *There were many factors that led to Rickey’s success, but it was support from others in baseball that was most important.* Students can carry the Conversation Cues into small groups to support their own independent, productive, and equitable conversations.

Mr. Valencia: What if I replace **but** with **and**? **And** is also a conjunction. How would **and** change the meaning? I'll give you some time to think. Emma, you want to give it a shot?

Emma: It is adding on to the, like, the idea of the first (part of the) sentence?

Mr. Valencia: Can anyone repeat or rephrase what Emma just said?

Santiago: It would have the same idea as the first two chunks.

Mr. Valencia: Right, **and** would have the same idea as the first two chunks. Two connecting, same ideas. So how does **but** change that for me? Jazmin?

Jazmin: **But** would change it.

Mr. Valencia: Can you say more about that, Jazmin?

Jazmin: It would change it because **but** would say there are many things happening, but this is the one.

Mr. Valencia: So does anyone want to add something else to that?

Daniel: **But** is saying this is the main thing happening.

Mr. Valencia: Right, now the sentence is going to the main factor (for success), or a contrast. **But** is something that is going to tell us a contrast. (Exchange continues.)

Strategic Grouping

As much as possible, facilitate opportunities in class for groups to discuss and complete content and tasks. Vary these groups so ELLs have opportunities to interact with a wide variety of speakers in different situations, thus expanding the opportunity for language development. For particularly challenging tasks, such as the collaborative problem-solution essay, which students plan and write across Lessons 2–6, think about strategically grouping ELLs with native and proficient English speakers. For more manageable tasks, interacting in homogeneous proficiency groups may promote English language development through grappling. At times, grouping speakers of the same home language may facilitate development of home language in association with content, boosting students’ connectedness to in-class material.

Performance Task

In Lesson 13, students participate in a performance task, which is designed to celebrate and highlight their learning over the course of the module. In this module, the performance task is the Voices of American Indian Boarding Schools Audio Museum, in which students share the recordings they have planned and prepared across earlier lessons. These recordings feature students reading aloud a text written by or about a student of an American Indian boarding school. Students also develop and record a preface to introduce and contextualize the reading and a reflection to discuss its overall meaning and impact. This performance task provides opportunities for academic speaking and listening practice, which is so critical for ELLs, and the format of the audio museum—which is built around pre-recorded pieces rather than live presentations—may help assuage ELLs’ nerves. Furthermore, the end of unit assessment preceding the performance task supports students in recording, reflecting upon, and refining their work. If students still seem nervous to participate in the audio museum, remind them that the performance task is not formally assessed; rather, it is an opportunity for students to share and celebrate their and their classmates’ work and imagination.

Differentiated Materials

Differentiated (▲) materials are available for ELLs and other students who would benefit from an increased level of support. These resources have been modified for the purposes of creating accessibility to content and concepts and supporting language development. Depending upon the task being carried out, images, selected response options, answer banks, sentence frames, or model responses have been embedded to guide students’ thinking without compromising a focus on standards and the skills that students are developing and applying to meet them.

Celebration

Celebrate the courage, enthusiasm, diversity, and bilingual assets that ELLs bring to the classroom. Additionally, students can celebrate their successful attempts at communication and their ability to extend and enhance the discussions.
