Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.6.1 – Opening A: Students participate in a collaborative activity to construct the Model Literary Argument Essay using paragraph chunks. This activity prepares them to write their own argument essays, with clear reasons presented in Proof Paragraphs.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time A: As students read the Model Literary Argument Essay, they cite the textual evidence that most strongly supports an analysis of what the text says explicitly as well as inferences drawn from the text.

- RI.6.2 – Work Time A: As students read the Model Literary Argument Essay, they determine the central idea.

- W.6.1 – Work Time B: Students use the Painted Essay® structure to analyze the Model Literary Argument Essay, looking closely at how the writer created an argument to support the main claim with clear reasons, relevant evidence, and reasoning. The Painted Essay® (Diana Leddy, Vermont Writing Collaborative) guides students to code each section of their essay a different color to understand each part, the content of each part, and how the different parts connect.

- W.6.4 – Work Time B: Students analyze the organization and development of a model argument essay, reflecting on how each paragraph relates to the author’s purpose.

- W.6.5 — Work Time B: With support, students develop and strengthen their writing by examining the structure of the Model Literary Argument Essay and using it to generate criteria for their own writing.

- W.6.9a — Work Time B: Students examine the Model Literary Argument Essay and locate the evidence that supports the points made in the Proof Paragraphs.

- W.6.1 – Work Time B: Students analyze the Model Literary Argument Essay and make connections to the criteria for effective argument essays.

- W.6.1 – Closing and Assessment A: As they examine the Characteristics of Effective Argument Writing anchor chart, students identify aspects of the model essay that align to argument writing. They note where the writer created an argument to support a claim with clear reasons and relevant evidence.

- In this lesson, students focus on Work to Become Effective Learners, persevering as they read and analyze a new text with partners.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Students may examine more samples of argument essays. Providing multiple sample essays for students to color-code and analyze will support their understanding of genre and the subtleties of writing a counterclaim and using reasoning effectively.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Students have worked with the Painted Essay® structure in the previous modules. In this unit, they use the same structure but evaluate how it changes when applied to writing a literary argument.

Support All Students

- Analyzing the model may be more challenging for students with limited language proficiency. Scaffold and support student learning through strategic grouping, ensuring that ELLs with lower language ability work with stronger readers and writers. To maintain equity in participation within groups, and to give students the opportunity to specialize with specific components of the task, consider using a jigsaw approach to adapt the model analysis exercise. In this adaptation, students are assigned specific roles (e.g., write the gist; determine the purpose and/or audience; show connections to prompt), given a chance to work first with other students who have the same role, and then placed in other groups to present their findings. ▲

- Before students can be expected to produce an essay that imitates the structure of a model, it is critical that they understand the content of the model as deeply as possible. Although the Model Literary Argument Essay has been written with careful attention to students’ expected reading levels, do not assume that all students comprehend it after one read. Consider using a Final Word protocol to support students’ idea development during the discussion. ▲

- Annotating the model essay with small pictures or glossed keywords may support student understanding of content and structure. ▲

- Consider various options for the discussion surrounding the audience and purpose of the model essay. Students may be best supported in pairs or triads, or they may prefer to write their ideas. Allow students ample processing time before expecting them to share an idea related to the model essays. A Think-Pair-Share protocol may help students contribute to the conversation more equitably.

- Co-construction of anchor charts offers opportunities for collaboration and physical movement.

- To support ELLs, this lesson is the first in a series of lessons that follows a pattern with which students are already familiar after their work in Modules 1 and 2. This lesson invites students to revisit the Painted Essay® structure, in which paragraphs and/or sentences are color-coded according to the function they serve in an essay. Representing text structure visually is especially supportive for ELLs, as it allows them to more clearly identify relationships across an essay’s ideas without the pressure of interpreting detailed verbal descriptions. In this lesson, students use the familiar Painted Essay® structure to break down and orient themselves to a new essay type: the literary argument.

- ELLs may find it challenging to analyze the Model Literary Argument Essay in the allotted time. Remind students that some of the content of this essay should be familiar to them, as it is based on the actions and ideas of characters from the anchor text, *Two Roads*. Clarify that the goal of analyzing the model is not necessarily to understand every word, but instead to recognize the purpose of sentences and paragraphs and how they relate to one another. Point out, too, that students will have opportunities in the following five lessons to revisit the model essay, piece by piece, for a closer look.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.7, 6.I.C.10, 6.I.C.11, 6.I.C.12, 6.II.A.1, 6.II.A.2, 6.II.C.6, and 6.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- During Work Time A, check for student understanding of gist in the model essay. Use any misconceptions or common issues as teaching points in upcoming lessons when the model is deconstructed in a more detailed way.

- Throughout Work Time A, frequently review student work to ensure they are color-coding accurately. Use common issues as whole group teaching points.

Down the Road

- In Lessons 2–6, students continue to deconstruct the model and complete a collaborative practice argument essay. In each lesson, students look at a discrete aspect of the argument essay model and practice using it in their own writing. Students then plan and draft an argument essay during their mid-unit assessment in Lessons 7–9.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare

- the Model Literary Argument Essay chunks. Make copies and cut the model essay into the four chunks indicated (each is a paragraph). Ensure that there are exactly enough chunks to make several complete essays. Depending on the number of students in class, some students may need to pair up to ensure there are no extra essay chunks that do not make a complete essay.

- the Argument Writing anchor chart to be used in Closing and Assessment A.

- Reread the Paint an Essay lesson plan (from Module 1, Unit 2, Lesson 6, Work Time C) to remember the color-coding and the purpose of each choice of color.

- Gather colored pencils or markers in red, blue, yellow, and green.

- Review the student tasks and example answers to get familiar with what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Prepare copies of handouts for students, including entrance ticket (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.6.1 (10 minutes)

- Distribute the **Model Literary Argument Essay chunks**, one chunk for each student. Based on the number of students in the class, some students may need to pair up.

- Direct students to read their paragraph to themselves silently and determine which part of the essay it is.

- Read aloud the writing prompt for the model essay that they will be analyzing in this lesson:

- “Should Pop bring Cal to Washington DC with him?”

- Cue students to move about the room finding people who have the other three paragraphs of the essay. Push students to use the content of their paragraph to determine which students have the missing pieces.

- When all groups have found each other, direct them to read the full essay aloud with their group.

- Using a total participation technique, invite responses from the class:

“What is this text about?” (It explains the reasons why Cal should not go to Washington DC with Pop and should go to Challagi Indian Industrial School instead.)

- Explain that this type of essay is called an argument. In an argument the writer states an opinion, in this case that Pop should not bring Cal to Washington with him. Point out that the writer uses evidence to support her reasons why Cal should not go to Washington and should go to Challagi instead, which helps the reader to follow the argument. Emphasize that the essays they write, like the model, will be grounded in evidence from the anchor text, *Two Roads*.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar to or the same as previous lessons. Invite students to choose a habit of character focus for themselves for this lesson.

For Lighter Support

- During Opening A, students receive a single paragraph from the Model Literary Argument Essay and then move about the room to find classmates who have the other three paragraphs. For an added challenge for students who need lighter support, consider distributing only the first sentences (i.e., the topic sentences) of the four paragraphs. After forming a group with the students who have the other topic sentences, students can put the topic sentences in order and then make predictions about the kind of content, evidence, or reasoning they expect to see in the paragraphs that follow. Students can then compare their predictions against the complete essay.

For Heavier Support

- During Opening A, students receive a single paragraph from the Model Literary Argument Essay and then move about the room to find classmates who have the other three paragraphs. For ELLs who need heavier support, consider distributing paragraphs to pairs of students, rather than to individuals. Students can read their paragraph aloud and negotiate its meaning collaboratively before looking for the classmates with the missing pieces.

Work Time

A. Analyze a Model Literary Argument Essay (15 minutes)

- Distribute **colored pencils** and guide students through using these and their **Painted Essay® template** to color code their **Model Literary Argument Essay.** Refer to the **Paint an Essay lesson plan** and the **Model Literary Essay: Painted (example for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Read the context of the first paragraph, stopping at “ . . . and make friends.” Turn and Talk:

“What is the purpose of the sentences I just read? What color should they be?” (The first section is part of the introduction and should be red. It is the context the reader needs to know about the characters and conflict in Two Roads.)

- Focus students on the next sentence: “Although Cal feels nervous and sad that he cannot go with his father, Pop should not bring Cal to Washington with him.” Turn and Talk:

“What color should we code this sentence?” (This sentence is the main claim and is coded green. The claim provides the main idea that you want the reader to take away.)

- Clarify the language students will use to name the parts of an argument essay. Tell students that in an argument essay, the focus statement is referred to as the “main claim.” Help students understand that the main claim is similar to the “focus statement” in an informative essay. In this essay, it is an opinion that needs to be supported with evidence and reasons. Focus students on the final sentence of the introduction: “The events in Washington are not appropriate for Cal to attend, and spending some time at Challagi is a better alternative for him.” Turn and Talk:

“This sentence previews the next two Proof Paragraphs, which will develop the yellow and blue points. In this essay, those points are reasons why Pop should not bring Cal to Washington with him. What colors should I color code each reason that supports the claim?” (The first reason is yellow and the second reason is blue.)

- Ensure students understand that the claim states the writer’s opinion, supported by two reasons, which are given and explained in each Proof Paragraph. For example, in the model, the two reasons the author gives to support Pop’s decision not to bring Cal to Challagi are that it is dangerous and that Cal will benefit from his education at Challagi. These become the basis of each Proof Paragraph.

- Read Proof Paragraph 1.

- Ask:

“What is the job of this paragraph in the essay?” (To give a reason why Pop should not bring Cal with him to DC.)

“What color should it be? Why?” (Yellow because it supports the yellow point that DC will be too dangerous for Cal.)

- Read Proof Paragraph 2.

- Ask:

“What is the job of this paragraph in the essay?” (To give a second reason why Pop should not bring Cal with him to DC.)

“What color should it be? Why?” (Blue because it supports the blue point that Cal needs to get back to his education by attending school at Challagi.)

- Turn and Talk:

“What is the role of the conclusion in an argument essay?” (Students should mention that the purpose is to wrap up the piece by restating the main claim and adding some additional thinking about why it is important. For example, in the model, this paragraph restates the claim that Pop should not bring Cal to Washington, and also recognizes that although there are drawbacks to this decision, it’s still the best choice.)

“What color should you code it? Why?” (Green because it is a mix of the claim, reason 1, and reason 2. Students might also mention that the shade of green differs from that used in the main claim in the introduction. This shows that when they run the ideas in the yellow paragraph and the ideas in the blue paragraph through their own mind, they come together to make something new—their own thinking on the topic, but still connected back to the claim.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- Work Time A, during which students analyze a Model Literary Argument Essay, is largely discussion-based. Use this as an opportunity to challenge ELLs who need lighter support to deepen their thinking and expand upon the ideas of their classmates. Use strategic combinations of Conversation Cues to prompt more complex contributions to the discussion. For example:

- “Can you say more about that?” (Goal 1)

- “What, in the model essay, makes you think so?” (Goal 3)

- “Can you explain why your classmate came up with that response?” (Goal 4)

- For further practice with L.6.3a and to build repetition in the model essay lessons (a similar task was suggested in the equivalent lesson of Module 2), develop an additional sentence-variety task for students who need lighter support. After students analyze the model essay in Work Time A, challenge students to practice separating complex sentences into multiple sentences. Remind them that their grammar, punctuation, or orthography may require adjusting if the sentence structure is altered. Encourage them to reflect, aloud or in writing, on the ways in which the meaning, emphasis, style, and/or function of the sentences change as their structure changes or as they are broken down into multiple sentences. For an added challenge, invite students to locate sentences on their own that could be reasonably separated; otherwise, provide them with specific examples. An example of this exercise can be found below:

- Rewrite the following sentence as two or more sentences: After years of living on the road with his son, Cal, camping and hopping trains, Pop tells Cal that he plans to go to Washington DC. (Pop has lived on the road with Cal for three years. They camp together and hop trains. Then, Pop tells Cal that he plans to go to Washington, DC.)

For Heavier Support

- Work Time A, during which students analyze a Model Literary Argument Essay, is largely discussion-based. Use this as an opportunity to support ELLs who need heavier support. Use strategic combinations of Conversation Cues to help students understand, and be understood by, one another. For example:

- “I’ll give you time to think and write or sketch.” (Goal 1)

- “So, do you mean \_\_\_?” (Goal 1)

- “Who can repeat what your classmate said?” (Goal 2)

- During Work Time A, if it is feasible to do so, pair students into homogeneous language groups. As needed, allow students to use their home languages as a resource to help them interpret the essay and paint it appropriately.

Work Time

B. Debrief Literary Argument Writing Checklist – W.6.1 (10 minutes)

- Distribute and display the **Argument Writing checklist**. Invite students to read the checklist to themselves.

- Using a total participation technique, invite responses from the group:

“What do you notice about this checklist? What do you wonder?” (Responses will vary.)

- With their groups from Opening A, direct students to reread the Model Literary Argument Essay and discuss the following prompt. Refer to the **Model Literary Argument Essay: Annotated (example for teacher reference)**:

“What characteristics on this checklist do you see done well in the model? What evidence from the model supports your thinking?” (Responses will vary.)

- If productive, cue students to listen carefully and seek to understand:

“Who can tell us what your classmate said in your own words?” (Responses will vary.)

- Refocus students whole group, and invite each group to share some of their responses. As students share out the characteristics, jot down, say aloud, sketch, and display each characteristic to provide visual reinforcement. Reassure students that they might not understand everything on this checklist right now, but they will learn more about it as they plan and write their essays.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Closing and Assessment

A. Debrief Literary Argument Writing Anchor Chart – W.6.1 (10 minutes)

- Ask students to think about the model and name some of the characteristics of argument writing they have noticed. Explain that they will continue to add to this chart in future lessons as they analyze each paragraph in the model. Consult the **Characteristics of Effective Argument Writing anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** for support.

- Scribe student responses on the **Characteristics of Effective Argument Writing anchor chart**, answer questions and clarify any misconceptions.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
