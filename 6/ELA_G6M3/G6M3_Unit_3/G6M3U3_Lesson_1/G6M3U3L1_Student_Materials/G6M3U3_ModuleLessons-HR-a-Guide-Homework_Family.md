Why were American Indian boarding schools first established?

- *American Indian boarding schools were established to assimilate Native Americans into white American culture through education and erasure of Native American identity.*

What kinds of experiences did students have at American Indian boarding schools? How did these experiences impact students?

- *Students may have experienced forced aesthetic changes (e.g., their hair was cut and their clothes were changed), linguistic changes (e.g., they were not allowed to use their Native American languages), and identity changes (e.g., their names were changed).*

- *Students may have experienced abuses or cruelty at the hands of the school’s administration.*

- *Students may have formed strong bonds with other students and exchanged tribal knowledge that actually strengthened their ties to their heritage (e.g., stomp dances, sweat lodges, language, oral tradition).*

What factors influence our identities?

- *Our peers, our school, our families, and our experiences can affirm or threaten our identities.*

- *Identities are dynamic and change in response to experience, awareness, and self-reflection.*

- *Identities are complicated and conflicting, and tensions may exist among our different identities.*

What will your student be doing at school?

In Unit 3, the focus is literary argument writing and preparing for the performance task. Students begin the unit by looking at a model argument essay. Students examine the essay one paragraph at a time to glean information about how the author crafted the text to state a claim, support the claim with reasons, provide evidence, and explain their reasoning. Working in collaboration with a partner, students plan and draft a literary argument essay on a different prompt. The mid-unit assessment requires students to demonstrate mastery of these skills by independently writing a literary argument essay on a new prompt. Students synthesize their comprehension of the anchor text, their practice with proper pronoun use and effective sentence variety, as well as their understanding of argument writing to choose and defend their position on a question related to the plot of *Two Roads*: Should Cal return to Challagi Indian Industrial School?

Students then transition into preparing for the performance task, an audio museum featuring the voices of American Indian boarding school students. The impact of these schools, though profoundly felt among the school’s attendees, has gone largely unacknowledged in mainstream narratives of North American history. In this performance task, the Voices of American Indian Boarding Schools Audio Museum, students will act as witnesses to this time period by organizing an audio museum to highlight the experiences and amplify the voices of American Indian boarding school students.

Students will:

1.  Select from a carefully curated list of primary source texts (poems, songs, journal entries, and personal narratives) written by students who attended these schools.

2.  Write two accompanying pieces: (a) a preface, introducing their selected piece and situating it in history by providing context about its content, author, etc.; and (b) a brief reflection, which explains why they selected this piece, what the piece means to them, and why it is important to highlight the stories of American Indian boarding school students in general.

3.  Record their reflections, along with a respectful reading of the primary source text, to be displayed at listening stations within the audio museum.

4.  Invite the community, such as peers, teachers, and families, to experience the museum and discover this important piece of U.S. history.

Central to the EL Education curriculum is a focus on “habits of character” and social-emotional learning. Students work to become effective learners, developing mindsets and skills for success in college, career, and life (e.g., initiative, responsibility, perseverance, collaboration); work to become ethical people, treating others well and standing up for what is right (e.g., empathy, integrity, respect, compassion); and work to contribute to a better world, putting their learning to use to improve communities (e.g., citizenship, service).

In this unit, students work to become effective learners by demonstrating perseverance as they read and analyze a model text and collaborate to plan and draft a practice essay with peers. Students work to become ethical people by showing integrity as they complete their independent research reading and share their learning with their peers, making connections between texts that strengthen their content knowledge. Students show compassion, empathy, and respect as they choose performance task texts and reflect on the experiences of the young people who attended American Indian boarding schools. Their learning culminates in the performance task, which allows students to contribute to a better world by bringing the voices and stories of a marginalized group of people to light and challenging viewers to reflect on the consequences of forced assimilation.

How can you support your student at home?

Read articles with your student that incorporate graphics or photographs. Talk to your student about the connection between the article and the visual element. Ask your student what further information about the article topic he/she can learn from the visual element.

Read versions of the same story that offer different points of view. Talk to your student about how the story changes based on the point of view from which the story is told.

Read the anchor text with your student. Occasionally, ask your student to retell the events of a chapter you’ve read together.

Talk to your student about his/her favorite character from a book, graphic novel, television show, or movie. Ask your student what attributes of that character makes the character his/her favorite.

Write stories with your student. Use vivid adjectives and exciting verbs to spice up the sentences in your stories. Explicitly acknowledge when an author or speaker has used particularly clever sentence construction or incorporated impactful language.

Tinker with the audio recording tools that students will be using in the classroom to record their performance task. Practice playing with the features of the tool and experiment with ways to enhance the recording, perhaps by adding in background music or sound effects.

Talk to your student about his/her favorite book, graphic novel, television show, or movie. Ask your student what messages, lessons, or insights the text, show, or movie is trying to express to the audience.

Unit 3: Homework

Student homework in Unit 3 provides opportunities for students to prepare for their literary argument essay, both collaborative and independent. Students are able to continue work on their essay planners at home. Student homework in the first half of Unit 3 also consists of students keeping active with their independent research reading. Student homework in the second half of Unit 3 consists of student preparation for the performance task. Students have the opportunity to spend extra time selecting a text, finishing their performance task recording planner, and finalizing their performance task recording.

**Research reading:** Your student is expected to independently research the topic of study in this module, American Indian boarding schools, by reading topic-related books of his or her choice. Research reading will be assigned on evenings when students are not already reading the anchor text. Students will be expected to read for approximately 20 minutes each day and respond to a prompt of choice in the front of the independent reading journal.

**Choice reading:** If your student would also like to independently read and respond to a book of free choice, he or she may use the back of the independent reading journal.

Independent Reading

**Directions:** Remember to record responses to research reading in the front of your independent reading journal and responses to choice reading in the back. Try to choose a different prompt each time.

Record any new vocabulary in your vocabulary log. Underline vocabulary found during independent reading.

**Record:**

- Date

- Title and author of your reading book

- Pages you have read

- Prompt

- Response

**Example:**

<u>Date:</u> January 14

<u>Book Title and Author:</u> *Two Roads* by Joseph Bruchac

<u>Pages Read:</u> 299–318

<u>Prompt:</u> Explain how excerpts from the text represent accurate historical context.

<u>Response:</u> In the final part of *Two Roads*, the setting changes from Challagi boarding school to Washington, DC, where Pop and thousands of other veterans have set up a tent city as they demonstrate outside of the capital. They called themselves the Bonus Army because they had come to collect the bonus payment promised to them in exchange for their service during World War I. I learned that this aspect of the novel was actually historically accurate. There really was a Bonus Army. They had been issued certificates for payment for their services; however, they were not supposed to be able to redeem the certificates until 1945. The Great Depression devastated the country. Veterans in the Bonus Army demanded that they be able to cash in their certificates early. It was also true that President Hoover ordered troops to clear the protesters by force, as depicted in the book. Discovering that these events in the novel were accurate was really impactful for me; it led me to research all sorts of other information about this time period that I never knew before and showed me that books can be fun and educational!

(Note: The example above uses *Two Roads* as the text in mention. The event mentioned in the example is from a section of the novel students do not read. Students will not be using the anchor text for their journal entries; students will respond to the writing prompts based on their chosen independent research text.)

**Consider using the following independent reading prompts.**[^1]

- How does this text add to your understanding of one of the Guiding Questions of the module?

- Which habits of character are demonstrated in the text? Explain.

- Which habits of character are NOT demonstrated in the text? Explain.

- Record two or three facts in your own words that you learned from the text.

- Summarize your research reading today in no more than five sentences.

- Explain a way in which you connect to the text.

- Explain how the text connects to another text you’ve read.

- Explain how the text connects to something currently happening in the world.

- Explain how the text connects to *Two Roads*.

- Explain how the text relates to the topic of American Indian boarding schools.

- Explain how the text relates to historical context across time periods and/or different events in history.

- Explain how excerpts from the text represent accurate historical context.

- Choose one new word from your reading today and analyze it on a vocabulary square.

| **Definition in your own words**                  | **Synonyms** (words with the same meaning) |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Words with the same affix or root**             | **Sketch**                                 |
| **Translation in home language** (if appropriate) |                                            |

Vocabulary

**Directions:** In the classroom, you have been recording words from your texts in your vocabulary log. Throughout this unit, you have been research reading topic-related books at home to build your knowledge of critical problems and design solutions and recording words in your independent reading journal.

Choose a word from your research reading or from a text you’ve read in class and add the word to your vocabulary log. Try to choose a different word to add and to practice a different vocabulary strategy each time. For each word, be sure to add the following:

1.  The definition, or meaning, of the word

<!-- -->

3.  The vocabulary strategy you used to figure out the meaning of the word

4.  A sketch or diagram that helps you to better understand the meaning of the word

Record new vocabulary in vocabulary logs and mark academic vocabulary with a symbol—for example, a star:

- Academic vocabulary: words you might find in informational texts on many different topics. For example, the words evidence and rationale are words that could be found in books on any topic.

- Domain-specific vocabulary: words about a particular topic. For example, the words *tadpoles*, *frogspawn*, and *amphibians* are some that would be found on the topic of frogs.

**Vocabulary Strategies**

As a reminder, the vocabulary strategies we’ve been working on in class are:

- Context: Read the sentence around the word.

- Look at the affixes for clues.

- Look at the root of the word for clues.

- Use a dictionary.

- Discuss the word with another person (after attempting some of the above strategies).

[^1]: Some of the prompts will not be appropriate for the text students are reading. Invite students to choose a prompt that works for the text they have just read.
