Cal and Pop certainly make a good team, and they will miss each other a lot. Still, it is better for both of them if Pop does not bring Cal to Washington. Pop has two goals: he wants to help veterans get what they deserve, and he wants Cal to be safe and educated. The best way for Pop to accomplish both of these goals is to go to Washington alone, without Cal. They will reunite soon after and begin a better life.
