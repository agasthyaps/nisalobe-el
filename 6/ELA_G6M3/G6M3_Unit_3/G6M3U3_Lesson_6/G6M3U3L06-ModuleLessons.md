Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.6.1e – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they deepen their understanding of an argument’s conclusion by describing its relationship to an introduction.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time A: Students analyze the conclusion of the model literary argument essay, examining how reasons have been supported with cited textual evidence.

- W.6.1e – Work Time A: Students analyze the conclusion of the model essay in preparation to write the conclusions for their collaborative essays

- RL.6.1 – Work Time B: Students use textual evidence from *Two Roads* to write conclusions that follow from the arguments presented in their collaborative literary argument essays.

- W.6.1e – Work Time A: Students write conclusions that follow from the arguments presented in their essays.

- W.6.4 – Work Time B: Students produce clear and coherent conclusions for their collaborative literary argument essays.

- W.6.5 – Work Time B: With support from their partners, students develop strong conclusions for their essays.

- W.6.9a – Work Time B: Students use textual evidence to develop the conclusions of their essays.

- W.6.1e – Work Time C: Students participate in a peer review to identify the extent to which classmates have produced essay conclusions that clearly reiterate the essays’ arguments and restate their claims.

- W.6.5 – Work Time C: Students receive guidance and feedback from their peers during a peer review of their collaborative essay drafts.

- Students may feel strongly about their decisions when discussing the analysis of the conclusion. Be open to students asking questions that challenge the reflection or restatement label that is documented on the teacher reference version of the Analyze Model Conclusion Chunk. Encourage students to logically express their reasons. This type of dialogue strengthens students’ argumentative skills by requiring them to provide evidence to support their opinion.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- An optional Mini Language Dive, intended for use after analyzing the model conclusion in Work Time A, is available in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Students have now read the entire model essay. Students may draft their own conclusion to the model essay to test their understanding of the structure of a conclusion before they draft their collaborative conclusion paragraph.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Students have been analyzing a model and using their analysis to draft the introduction and Proof Paragraphs of an argument essay. This lesson continues those routines to guide students in drafting their conclusion.

Support All Students

- Students may need additional support drafting their conclusions. Group those students and lead a discussion that will guide them in synthesizing their thoughts about the essay. Consider using the students’ Collaborative Literary Argument Evidence note-catcher to guide the discussion.

- Writing the conclusion could take some pairs longer than 15 minutes. Offer more time, if it is available.

- An optional Mini Language Dive, intended for use after analyzing a conclusion in Work Time A, is available. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson builds upon students’ understanding of the literary argument structure by inviting them to closely examine the conclusion of the Model Literary Argument Essay. A “Conclusion Chunk” activity, which asks students to underline sentences in the conclusion based on the purpose they are serving in the paragraph, supports ELLs’ knowledge of academic writing in a guided and scaffolded way.

- ELLs may find it challenging to preserve cohesion in an essay that is written across several lessons. Reiterate the importance of drafting and revising in order to improve transitions across ideas. Remind students that the peer review in this lesson may illuminate elements of their writing that they can improve in the essays they write independently during the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.4, 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.7, 6.I.C.10, 6.I.C.11, 6.I.C.12, 6.II.A.1, 6.II.A.2, 6.II.B.3, 6.II.B.4, 6.II.B.5, 6.II.C.6, and 6.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- Ensure that students understand all the components of an argument essay prior to planning another essay independently in the next lesson and prior to writing another essay for the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment. Remind students of all the many resources they have to be successful, such as models and anchor charts.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will use what they learned during the collaborative writing process to independently plan their argument essay.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.6.1a, W.6.1e (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 6**. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 6 (example for teacher reference)** for possible responses.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar to or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Analyze a Model Conclusion – W.6.1e (10 minutes)

- Invite students to move into their predetermined writing partnerships.

- Distribute **Analyze Model Conclusion Chunk**. Distribute **light green** and **dark green colored pencils**.

- Read the Analyze the Model Conclusion Chunk aloud as students read along silently.

- Display the **Painted Essay® Template**.

- Remind students of the parts of a conclusion:

- Restated focus/main claim

- Reflection

- Explain that the conclusion is meant to bring an end to the writer’s argument. The conclusion answers the questions *What*? and *So what?* The conclusion is a restatement of the writer’s main idea (*What* is the essay about?), but also a reflection on key points the writer has taken away from the essay (*So what?* Why is this important?).

- Explain that partners will work together to underline the sentences in the conclusion based on the purpose they are serving in the conclusion, either to restate the focus/main claim or to reflect on what the author and reader can take away from reading about this topic. Restatement sentences will be underlined in dark green; reflection sentences will be underlined in light green.

- Direct students’ attention to the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**. Explain to students that during the discussion with their partner they may not agree on the purpose of a sentence. Remind students of what successful collaboration looks and sounds like.

- Invite students to begin, and circulate to support students in reading and underlining the sentences of the conclusion. Use **Analyze Model Conclusion Chunk (example for teacher reference)** as a resource to support students.

- Refocus whole group. Display the Analyze the Model Conclusion Chunk. Use **equity sticks** to call on students. Underline sentences in the respective color as students provide answers. Encourage respectful discussion when students disagree on the purpose of a sentence.

- Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time A, after students analyze the conclusion paragraph of the Model Literary Argument Essay, invite students to participate in a Mini Language Dive in small groups to examine a concluding sentence that restates the main claim of the essay (W.6.1e). This Mini Language Dive also reinforces students’ understanding of academic writing (W.6.1d).

For Heavier Support

Work Time

B. Write a Collaborative Conclusion – W.6.1e (15 minutes)

- Invite students to retrieve their **Collaborative Literary Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer** and their copy of the **Argument Writing checklist**. Point out the following characteristic on the checklist:

- “W.6.1e: I have a conclusion that is clearly related to my argument and restates my claim.”

- Turn and Talk:

“Look at the second column. Are there any specific criteria you should be aware of specifically for this collaborative essay?” (The conclusion restates the main claim that was presented in the introduction.)

- As students share out, capture their responses in the Characteristics of this Argument Writing column and direct students to do the same on their copy. Refer to the **Argument Writing checklist (example for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Explain that students will work with their writing partner to draft their conclusion to the argument essay focused on Cal’s decision to leave school to find Pop. Students should base their draft on the information they gathered and organized on their **Collaborative Literary Argument Evidence note-catcher** and Collaborative Literary Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer.

- Distribute **lined paper** or **devices**, and invite writing partners to begin.

- Circulate and monitor, referencing the following resources as necessary:

- **Collaborative Literary Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer (example for teacher reference)**

- **Collaborative Literary Argument Evidence note-catcher (example for teacher reference)**

- With two minutes remaining, refocus students and allow time for them to log off devices or put away materials.

- Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Work Time

C. Peer Review – W.6.1e, W.6.5 (5 minutes)

- Ask students to retrieve their Argument Writing checklist. Group two writing partnerships to make a group of four, and direct partnerships to swap their essay drafts.

- Distribute **sticky notes** for recording their feedback.

- Focus students on the **Work to Contribute to a Better World anchor chart**, specifically *use my strengths*. Remind students that because they will be working to give a critique to the other partnership, they will need to use their strengths.

- Invite students to provide feedback to the other partners based on the criteria identified from the Argument Writing checklist: W.6.1e: I have a conclusion that is clearly related to my argument and restates my claim. Invite students to provide at least one star and one step.

- Circulate to support students as they work together to give feedback to one another. Emphasize that students should not make revisions yet.

- Invite students to reflect on their progress towards the relevant learning target.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

- Review the collaborative essays and **Collaborative Literary Argument Writing: Annotated (for teacher reference)** to determine additional support or next steps for individual or groups of students prior to the mid-unit assessment in Lesson 8.

Closing and Assessment

A. Share Independent Research Reading – RL.6.10, RI.6.10 (10 minutes)

- Refer to the **Independent Reading Sample Plans** to guide students through a research reading share or use a different routine.

- Remind students that the purpose of research reading is to build their content knowledge, domain-specific vocabulary, and achievement on reading complex texts. As necessary, use the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart** to review *integrity*. Students demonstrate integrity by keeping up with their independent research reading even though it can be challenging.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- If productive, during the independent research reading share, use strategic combinations of Conversation Cues to help ELLs who need heavier support to deepen their thinking and expand the conversation.

- “What, in your text, makes you think so?” (Goal 3)

- “Can you explain why your classmate came up with that response?” (Goal 4)

For Heavier Support

- If productive, during the independent research reading share, use strategic combinations of Conversation Cues to help ELLs who need lighter support to listen carefully to one another and be understood. For example:

- “Can you say more about that?” (Goal 1)

- “Who can repeat what your classmate said?” (Goal 2)

- “Can you say more about that?” (Goal 1)

Homework

A. Claim, Evidence, and Reasoning

- Students complete **Homework: Strengthen Claim, Evidence, and Reasoning**.
