5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

RI.6.5, W.6.1d, W.6.1e, SL.6.1

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

**The best way for Pop to accomplish both of these goals** is to go to Washington alone, without Cal. (from the conclusion of the Model Literary Argument Essay)

**Lesson 6 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after students analyze the conclusion of the model essay during Work Time A.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target **(I can determine the characteristics of a strong reflection by analyzing the model)** and W.6.1e by closing the argument essay with a concluding statement that reiterates the main claim of the essay. The sentence also helps students address W.6.1d by featuring elements typical of formal academic writing. Supporting standards: SL.6.1

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses two infinitive verb phrases (**to accomplish both of these goals**; **to go to Washington alone**). A simple copular verb, **is**, connects these two complex phrases.

- Transfer: **to** + verb \[+ object\] = infinitive phrase to reiterate the main claim in the conclusions of their collaborative and independent literary argument essay.

- Note: Students can refer to the Model Literary Argument Essay from Unit 3, Lesson 1 as needed to answer the questions in this Mini Dive.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **<u>The best way for Pop to accomplish both of these goals</u>** **is to go to Washington alone, without Cal.**

- Ask:

“What is the central idea of this sentence?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“What about this sentence indicates that it is an example of academic writing? Think back to the Mini Language Dive from Lesson 4.” (As in the Lesson 4 Mini Language Dive sentence, this sentence contains complex phrases separated by a simple verb, is.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **The best way for Pop to accomplish both of these goals**

- Ask:

“What goals is the writer referring to in this chunk?” (Helping veterans and keeping Cal safe.)

“What does the phrase The best way tell us about Pop’s actions?” (That there is a preferable way for Pop to accomplish these goals. This phrase states a clear argument.)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **<u>The best way for Pop to accomplish both of these goals</u>** **is to go to Washington alone, without Cal.**

- Ask:

“How does this sentence connect to the main claim of the essay?” (The main claim said that Pop should not bring Cal to Washington with him. This sentence restates the main claim by saying that Pop should go to Washington alone, without Cal.)

“How do the reasons given in the main claim relate to Pop’s goals, which are referenced in this sentence?” (The reasons in the main claim were that the veterans’ campaign is no place for a child, and that staying at Challagi might help Cal make friends and get an education. Pop’s goals are to have a successful campaign, and keep Cal safe. These goals are directly related to the main reasons of the essay. In a sense, they show the reasons through Pop’s eyes.)

“Based on all of this, what would you say is the function of this Mini Language Dive sentence within the overall essay?” (This sentence restates the main claim and connects it to the reasons that were presented in the essay. It helps to conclude the ideas of the essay and reminds the reader what the essay was all about.)

“Why is it important to include a sentence like this in the conclusions of your own essays?” (Because this helps make it clear to the reader what the purpose of the essay is, and it helps tie all the ideas together.)

- Ask:

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target:  
I can determine the characteristics of a strong reflection by analyzing the model?” (Responses will vary.)
