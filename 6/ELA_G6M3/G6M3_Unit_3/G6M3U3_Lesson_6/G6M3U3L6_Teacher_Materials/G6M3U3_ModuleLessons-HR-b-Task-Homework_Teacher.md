(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Read the following sample Proof Paragraph from an essay that claims Pop should take Cal to Washington (the opposite position being argued in the model essay). Then answer the questions to determine what could be done to make the paragraph more effective.

**\[1\]** One reason that Pop should bring Cal with him to Washington is that Cal and Pop are a good team. **\[2\]** They can understand each other without even speaking and they trust each other. **\[3\]** Even if Washington is dangerous, Cal will always listen to Pop and do as he says in order to avoid danger. **\[4\]** Pop might be fine in Washington by himself without Cal, but Pop is older and he could probably use Cal’s quick thinking and acting.

1.  Which of the following aspects of argument needs to be improved to make this an effective support paragraph?

2.  claim

3.  reason

4.  <u>evidence</u>

5.  reasoning

6.  Which <u>two</u> additions to the paragraph would improve the aspect of argument in your answer to question 1?

7.  <u>“Pop nods at the black pot. I pick it up. He hands me the butcher knife” (35).</u>

8.  Even if Cal is a smart kid, he doesn’t know anything about the war.

9.  <u>“If someone suddenly comes out that door with a gun, my plan is to push Pop aside and try to duck the shot. With that bad leg of his, he can’t always move that fast” (18).</u>

10. “I want to know you’ll be safe with three hots and a cot” (94).

11. Challagi is a school where every student is an American Indian, but this is a part of Cal’s identity that is very new to him. He might feel threatened or out of place there.

12. “. . . you can’t go to Washington with me. I’m not saying it’ll be dangerous, but it’ll be an army and you are not ready yet to be part of any army” (94).

13. Pop wants Cal to go to Challagi because he says it’s safer than being in Washington. However, Challagi might not be a very safe environment.
