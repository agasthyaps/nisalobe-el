**Focus Question:** Should Cal leave Challagi Indian School to find Pop?

**Stance 1: Cal should leave the Challagi Indian School to find Pop.**

W.6.1a: The claim is introduced. Context on the text is given. The claim is clearly communicated, and the focus is maintained.

W.6.1a: The first reason and its evidence are organized clearly.

W.6.1b: Claims are supported with clear reasons and relevant evidence from the text.

W.6.1c, L.6.6: Words, phrases, and clauses (e.g., main; on the other hand; if. . .) are consistently used to clarify the relationships among claim(s) and reasons.

When Pop went to Washington to participate in the veterans’ campaign, Cal stayed behind at Challagi Indian School. Cal had been nervous about going to Challagi. He did not know anyone there and he had never been away from Pop before. Plus, Pop had told him some scary stories about the people who worked at Challagi and how strict they were. Still, Cal wanted to do as Pop asked, and he promised that he would stay at Challagi and wait for Pop to return. Cal gave it a good try. He attended classes, learned new skills, and made a group of good friends. However, circumstances have changed, and now Pop might be in real danger. Cal had a premonition that Pop is going to be hurt, which terrifies Cal. Then, Cal’s friend Deacon told him that premonitions show things that might happen, and Cal might be able to intervene and stop it. Cal simply cannot ignore these visions. It is time for Cal to leave Challagi to find Pop in Washington.

The main reason why Cal should go find Pop is because Cal had a premonition that Pop is going to be hurt. In his dream, Pop and the other veterans are shot at while they are protesting. He imagines Pop being shot and Cal can feel his pain: “I felt the bullets entering my chest, and I was falling, dying” (275). Cal has always had visions in which he can feel the pain of other people, especially Pop. But this time is different. Cal usually dreams “of things that happened, even before \[he\] was alive on this earth” (275). This dream, on the other hand, “was about the living” (275). Also, this is the first vision he has had about Pop’s safety since he arrived at Challagi. Cal has missed Pop and worried about him the whole time, so this premonition must mean something more than simply missing Pop. If it is possible that Pop is in danger, Cal must go after him. Cal should not ignore his premonition, just in case it is true.

W.6.1d, W.6.4: Formal style is established and maintained.

W.6.1a: The second reason and its evidence are organized clearly.

W.6.1b: Claims are supported with clear reasons and relevant evidence from the text.

W.6.1c, L.6.6: Words, phrases, and clauses (e.g., another; if. . .) are consistently used to clarify the relationships among claim(s) and reasons.

RI.6.1, W.6.9: A clear understanding of the text is demonstrated by developing a valid claim supported by logical reasons and evidence from the text.

W.6.1e: Concluding statement follows from the argument presented.

L.6.2: Adequate use of the conventions of standard English capitalization, punctuation, and spelling is evident.

Another reason why Cal should go find Pop is because Cal might be able to stop this vision from becoming a reality. His friend Deacon tells him that premonitions like this can show “what might happen, not what has to happen” (282). Cal should trust Deacon because Deacon had a premonition too. Deacon knew that Cal was going to have a vision before Cal even had it. Cal believes that “there’s only one person” who can save Pop (282)—Cal. He is the one who had the vision, and he and Pop take care of each other. If it is true that Pop might get hurt, Cal must try to intervene and stop it from happening.

Cal promised Pop that he would stay at Challagi and wait for him to return. For months, Cal has done that. He fought through his feelings of sadness and missing Pop. But then Cal had a scary premonition that was different from the other visions he has had before. Cal and his friends believe that the events of the premonition could really happen. Pop could be seriously hurt, or even killed. If this could really happen, Cal cannot just stay and wait at Challagi. He needs to go find Pop in Washington and try his best to save him.

**Stance 2: Cal should not leave Challagi Indian School to find Pop.**

W.6.1a: The claim is introduced. Context on the text is given. The claim is clearly communicated, and the focus is maintained.

W.6.1d, W.6.4: Formal style is established and maintained.

W.6.1b: Claims are supported with clear reasons and relevant evidence from the text.

W.6.1c, L.6.6: Words, phrases, and clauses (e.g., main; on the other hand; if. . .) are consistently used to clarify the relationships among claim(s) and reasons.

W.6.1a: The second reason and its evidence are organized clearly.

W.6.1b: Claims are supported with clear reasons and relevant evidence from the text.

When Pop went to Washington to participate in the veterans’ campaign, Cal stayed behind at Challagi Indian School. Being part of the campaign would have been too dangerous for a kid. Cal had been nervous about going to Challagi, but he has done well there. He has learned a lot and made good friends. One night, Cal had a premonition that Pop and the other veterans were going to get hurt during the campaign. This premonition scared Cal and he considers running away to find Pop in Washington. He wants to try to save him. However, even if he is scared, Cal should not leave Challagl to find Pop. Washington is too dangerous for Cal, and he promised Pop that he would wait for him at Challagi.

The main reason why Cal should not go find Pop is that Washington is still too dangerous. When Pop first left for Washington, he told Cal that he was “not yet ready to be part of any army” (94). Then, in a letter he wrote to Cal, Pop said that all the veterans “are a real army now” (267). Cal has also read in the newspaper that some of the veterans marching in the campaign have been beat up or sent to jail. All of Pop’s initial concerns about the dangers are still true. If Cal was not ready to be part of an army a couple months ago, he still is not ready now. Pop and Cal might be able to protect each other if they are together in Washington, but what if Cal cannot find Pop at all? There are thousands of veterans in Washington. Pop has been traveling, “collecting other vets” and bringing them to Washington (267). If Cal goes and he cannot find Pop, he will be in a lot of danger.

Another reason why Cal should not go find Pop is that Cal promised Pop he would wait for him at Challagi. Cal has wanted to run away before but he did not because he promised “to stick it out” (245). If Cal goes to Washington, he breaks that promise to Pop. Cal has always trusted Pop and his decisions. Cal said, “I know \[Pop\] always has my best interests at heart. He just wants to take good care of me” (10). If Pop made Cal promise to stay at Challagi, Pop must have had a good reason for this. Even though he had a scary vision about Pop, Cal needs to trust that Pop knows best. Cal should stay true to his promise to Pop and wait for Pop at Challagi.

The premonition that Cal had about Pop really scared Cal. However, there is nothing he can do about it. The campaign in Washington remains too dangerous for a child. The events there are becoming violent. If Cal goes to Washington, he could be the target of violence, too, especially if he cannot find Pop once he arrives. It is better that Cal stay true to the promise he made to Pop. Cal should stay at Challagi, continue his education, and wait patiently for Pop to come get him when the campaign is over.

W.6.1c, L.6.6: Words, phrases, and clauses (e.g., another; if. . .; even though) are consistently used to clarify the relationships among claim(s) and reasons.

RI.6.1, W.6.9: A clear understanding of the text is demonstrated by developing a valid claim supported by logical reasons and evidence from the text.

W.6.1e: Concluding statement follows from the argument presented.

L.6.2: Adequate use of the conventions of standard English capitalization, punctuation, and spelling is evident.
