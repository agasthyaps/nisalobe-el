Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Work Time A: Students write a literary argument essay about whether Cal should return to Challagi Indian Industrial School at the end of the novel. Students use reasons and evidence from the text and reasoning to defend their stance. Although Grade 6 is not required to address counterclaim, students acknowledge the existence of the opposing position as part of their introduction and/or conclusion. (RL.6.1, RL.6.3, RL.6.10, W.6.1, W.6.4, W.6.6, W.6.9a, W.6.10, L.6.2, L.6.3, L.6.6)

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Some students may not require the level of scaffolding provided in this unit. Prompt students toward deeper levels of understanding and increased rigor by becoming familiar with Levels 3 and 4 of Webb’s Depth of Knowledge, a framework developed by Norman Webb to plan and provide complex instruction and assessments.

- If students finish the assessment before the period ends, they could begin reviewing and choosing from the possible texts for the end of unit assessment and the performance assessment.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the first half of this unit, students have been analyzing a model, writing collaboratively, and planning their own independent literary argument essay. This lesson assesses those skills as students use their plans to compose their literary argument essays.

Support All Students

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study, as well as the goals of the assessment.

- Support ELLs in the mid-unit assessment by reminding them of the related tasks that they have already successfully completed. Make sure that all assessment instructions are expressed very clearly. Consider asking students to paraphrase the instructions as a way to gauge understanding and/or provide ELLs with simpler or additional input. ▲

- Before the mid-unit assessment of Work Time A, consider reviewing the criteria on the Track Progress: Literary Argument Writing to help clarify the objectives. This will help students understand expectations, as well as offer a way for students to review the learning that has taken place throughout the unit to prepare them for the assessment. This review may be especially beneficial for ELLs, who may feel nervous about independently producing an essay during the assessment. ▲

- Provide feedback on the assessment that emphasizes effort, improvement, and achieving a standard, rather than relative performance. Remind students that they are not competing against their peers; their measure of success should be how much they personally have improved in mastery of a standard.

- To support ELLs, these lessons invite students to complete assessment tasks that draw from past learning in the unit. After analyzing the Model Literary Argument Essay, and then working with a partner to write a collaborative literary argument, students now write an independent literary argument essay that answers a similar question: “What is the most viable solution to Cal’s dilemma of whether to return to Challagi Indian Industrial School?” Devoting two lessons to students’ completion of their essays ensures that ample time is available for students to develop their ideas.

- ELLs may find it challenging to independently complete the mid-unit assessment without scaffolding. Point out the ways in which they have prepared for the independent essay. Encourage students to do their best, and assure them that they will continue learning together after the assessment.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.7, 6.I.C.10, 6.I.C.11, 6.I.C.12, 6.II.A.1, 6.II.A.2, 6.II.B.5, 6.II.C.6, and 6.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- Mid-Unit 3 Assessment: Write a Literary Argument Essay (student and teacher version) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- Decide in what format students will compose their essays. Provide lined paper or a computer with word processing software, depending on students’ needs and preferences.

- If students feel nervous about the mid-unit assessment, remind them of all the work they have done to prepare (i.e., writing the narratives in Unit 2, analyzing a model, writing a collaborative essay on a similar topic). Encourage them to recognize all the hard work and learning that has led to the end of unit assessment.

- Save a copy of the scored essays to use as a continued assessment of progress in writing. These pieces can be used to measure the progress of individual students throughout the year, as well as to identify common instructional needs in a class.

- When assessing and providing feedback to students on this assessment, use the Argument Writing Rubric (see Module 1 Teacher Guide: Appendix and/or Tools page, https://eled.org/tools) and the annotated sample essay to help complete the student Track Progress: Literary Argument Writing. Make notes in the appropriate column for each criterion in a different color than student responses. There is also space provided to respond to student comments.

- Students have done extensive work with L.6.3a in this module; consider how well students vary sentence patterns for meaning, reader/listener interest, and style to complete the rubric.

- Using information from this assessment, students are tracking progress toward anchor standard:

- W.1: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Write arguments to support claims in an analysis of substantive topics or texts using valid reasoning and relevant and sufficient evidence.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students begin preparing for the end of unit assessment and performance task by analyzing a model and then reviewing and choosing a text with which to work.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare

- Mid-Unit 3 Assessment: Write a Literary Argument Essay (see Assessment Overview and Resources)

- Track Progress folders

- Thoroughly review the directions and rubric for the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment, anticipating areas of challenge.

- Review the student tasks and example answers to get familiar with what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Ensure End of Unit 2 Assessments with feedback are available for each student at desks as they enter.

- Decide in what format students will compose their essays. Provide lined paper or a device with word processing software, depending on the students’ needs and preferences. Ensure that devices are in good working order, fully charged, and logged into before students begin composing their essays, to avoid wasting work time.

- Read all of the excerpts provided on the Performance Task Recording: Text List, and review for areas that may be sensitive for some readers. Some of the texts measure at a higher Lexile® level (La Flesche, Option A; Johnston, Options A, F, & G). These may require more support for students who are not reading above grade level.

- Prepare copies of handouts for students, including entrance ticket (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time A: Students could compose the essay online—using an online tool such as http://eled.org/0158, for example.

- Closing and Assessment A: Students may prefer to complete their Track Progress handouts in a word-processing document using speech-to-text facilities activated on devices or using an app or software such as http://eled.org/0103.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.6.10 (10 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lessons 8–9**. Students will also need their **End of Unit 2 Assessment with feedback**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar to or the same as previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Mid-Unit 3 Assessment: Write a Literary Argument Essay (65 minutes)

- Distribute **devices** with word-processing capabilities or **lined paper** on which students will compose their essay. Display the **Characteristics of Effective Argument Writing anchor chart**. Refer to **Characteristics of Effective Argument Writing anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**.

- Invite students to retrieve the following materials. Refer to the examples for teacher reference of each as needed while students work:

- **Independent Literary Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer**

- **Independent Argument Evidence note-catcher**

- **Argument Writing checklist**

- **Model Literary Argument Essay**

- Display and distribute the **Mid-Unit 3 Assessment: Write a Literary Argument Essay**.

- Invite students to follow along, reading silently in their heads, while it is read aloud. Make sure students understand the assessment directions; paraphrase some instructions, if needed. ▲

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence. Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**; review perseverance and what this looks and sounds like. Remind students that as they will be writing independently for the assessment, they may need to practice perseverance.

- Remind students that they planned this essay in the previous lessons.

- Invite students to begin the assessment.

- While students are taking the assessment, circulate to monitor and document their test-taking skills. Remind students that they may refer to any of the Unit 3 materials as necessary during the assessment.

- Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target, using a checking for understanding technique. Scan student responses and make note of students who might need support. Check in with them moving forward.

- Repeat, inviting students to self-assess how well they persevered in this lesson.

- Refer to **Mid-Unit 3 Assessment: Write a Literary Argument Essay: Annotated (example for teacher reference)** and the **Grade 6 Argument Writing rubric** to assess.

For Lighter Support

- Before the assessment of Work Time A, underline key vocabulary in the assessment directions and prompt and read aloud together as a class to ensure that students understand each task included in the assessment. Invite students who need lighter support to restate or clarify information for students who need heavier support.

For Heavier Support

- It may be challenging for students who need heavier support to adequately gauge their own speed and progress during the mid-unit assessment. If productive, incorporate a classroom “pause” halfway through the allotted time and inviting the class to take a stretch break or have a drink of water. Use this time to check in with students who need heavier support and help them celebrate their progress, adjust their goals, implement new writing strategies, and/or move past roadblocks.

Closing and Assessment

A. Track Progress – W.6.1 (15 minutes)

- Give students specific, positive feedback on their completion of the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment: Write a Literary Argument Essay.

- Distribute **Track Progress folders, Track Progress: Literary Argument Writing** and **sticky notes**.

- Guide students through completing the recording form.

- Direct students to retrieve their **Writing Record**. Explain that this form is to help students keep track of all of the writing they complete this year. Direct students to fill in the next row of the Writing Record about the literary argument essay they just wrote for the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment.

- Distribute **Performance Task Recording: Text List**, and explain the homework instructions. Students should be familiar with the readings before the next lesson and have an idea of which they might like to use for the performance task.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- If feasible, arrange small group conferences with students to revisit their answers to the Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lessons 8–9. Invite students who need lighter support to reflect aloud on their achievements and set further writing goals.

For Heavier Support

- If feasible, arrange one-on-one conferences with students to revisit their answers to the Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lessons 8–9. Provide simple sentence frames to students who need heavier support to help them reflect aloud on their performance on the mid-unit assessment. These frames may include the following:

- One star I wanted to continue to show in today’s assessment was \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

- One step that I wanted to work toward in today’s assessment was \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

- After the assessment, I feel that I \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
