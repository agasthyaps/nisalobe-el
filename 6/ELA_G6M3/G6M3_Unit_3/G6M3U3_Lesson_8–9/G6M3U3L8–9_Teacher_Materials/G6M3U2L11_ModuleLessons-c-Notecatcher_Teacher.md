<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pop wants to keep fighting—“He and the other vets had to try again and keep trying until they won their rightful bonuses . . . He was never going to quit trying, so I couldn’t give up either” (313).</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pop can’t focus on the campaign when Cal is there, skips taking a stand at the bridge after Cal arrives.</strong></p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Cal has reliable premonitions about Pop’s safety.</strong></p></li>

<td><p>Reasoning</p>
<p><strong>Pop originally told Cal that Cal could not come with him to Washington because of the veterans’ campaign. Cal left Challagi to save Pop, but the campaign still isn’t over. Now that Cal has done what he intended to do, and protected Pop, he should return to Challagi so that Pop can finish what he started.</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Reasoning</p>
<p><strong>Cal had a premonition that Pop and the other veterans were going to be hurt. Deacon told Cal that premonitions can show things that really might happen. Because of Cal’s vision, Pop decides not to participate in a protest that could have become dangerous. Cal should stay with Pop in order to tell him about other visions he has and keep Pop from danger.</strong></p></td>

<p><strong>Cal has made very good friends at Challagi.</strong></p></td>

<td><p>Evidence</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Misses his friends—“As much as I loved being back with my father, I was also missing the boys in our Creek gang” (314).</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cal is growing up, he is more independent.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cal’s friends are his “brothers” (314).</strong></p></li>
</ul></td>
<td><p>Evidence</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Asks Cal what he wants to do, doesn’t tell him he has to go back to Challagi—“You sure about that, son?” (313)</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Has told Cal (in letters and in person) how much he misses him—“It’s good just to sit here with you son, I’ve missed you” (309).</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cal is Pop’s only family.</strong></p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Reasoning</p>
<p><strong>When Pop first left to go to Washington, Cal did not want to go Challagi. He did not know anyone there and he knew how much he would miss Pop. Since then, Cal has made a group of really close friends that are his “brothers” (314). These boys are part of Cal’s “Creek gang” and he misses them (314). He should return to Challagi in order to continue building those friendships.</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Reasoning</p>
<p><strong>Pop and Cal do not have any family besides each other. It has been very difficult for the two of them to be away from each other. They have written letters when they talk about how much they miss each other. In Washington, instead of telling Cal that he has to return to Challagi, he asks Cal, “What now, son?” When Cal says that he is going back to Challagi, Pop asks him, “You sure about that, son?” (313). Pop is no longer telling Cal that he has to be at Challagi. He might want Cal to stay with him instead.</strong></p></td>

<td><p>Reason</p>
<p><strong>Cal wants to continue his education.</strong></p></td>

<p><strong>Cal’s time at Challagi was meant to be temporary.</strong></p></td>

<td><p>Evidence</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Has more to learn—“I could learn more about agricultural science, spend time in the horse barn” (314).</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Has already learned so much—“been allotted a plot of my own to farm” (273), has access to a library.</strong></p></li>
</ul></td>
<td><p>Evidence</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pop always said he’d come to Challagi when the campaign was over.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cal was just waiting for Pop to return.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cal’s friends and the superintendent know he isn’t planning on staying.</strong></p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Reasoning</p>
<p><strong>Cal has always been a smart kid who loves reading. At Challagi, he has access to an education that he did not have before. He can take academic classes and industrial classes. There is a library he can use. He even has a plot of land that is his to farm. Cal likes thinking about all the things he can learn if he stays at Challagi. He should return to school in order to continue his education.</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Reasoning</p>
<p><strong>Pop and Cal’s plan was never to have Cal stay at Challagi indefinitely. It was only supposed to be a temporary arrangement while Pop participated in the veterans’ campaign. If Cal returns to Challagi when he has the opportunity to stay with Pop, he is changing the plans they had to stick together.</strong></p></td>

<tr class="even">
<td><p>Reason</p>
<p><strong>Cal feels connected to his Creek roots for the first time.</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Reason</p>
<p><strong>Cal has become older and more mature.</strong></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Evidence</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Wants to connect more with his Creek identity; “. . . being Cal Blackbird meant I also had another road to follow, the road of being a Creek Indian” (314).</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stomp dancing, Creek words and phrases, sweat lodge.</strong></p></li>
</ul></td>
<td><p>Evidence</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Stayed at Challagi for months, even when he didn’t want to.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Managed to get to Washington by himself.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Has learned how to be independent.</strong></p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Reasoning</p>
<p><strong>Before Cal went to Challagi, he did not even know that he and Pop were Creek Indian. During his time at Challagi, however, he has learned so much more about this part of his identity. He has Creek friends, he has learned more Creek words, he has participated in stomp dancing, and his friends organized a sweat lodge for him, where he talked about his vision. This is all new for Cal and he should stay at Challagi to develop these relationships.</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Reasoning</p>
<p><strong>Even though Cal was only at Challagi for a couple months, he grew more mature and independent than he was before. He no longer needs Pop to always tell him what to do or how to act. Originally, Pop thought Cal was too young to be in Washington as an army was formed. But Cal has grown up a lot. He would be better able to protect himself now if the campaign became dangerous.</strong></p></td>

Now that I’ve thought about it, my claim is:

Responses will vary. Students will choose one of the two positions after evaluating all of the evidence they have collected for both sides. Then they will write the claim in their own words here.
