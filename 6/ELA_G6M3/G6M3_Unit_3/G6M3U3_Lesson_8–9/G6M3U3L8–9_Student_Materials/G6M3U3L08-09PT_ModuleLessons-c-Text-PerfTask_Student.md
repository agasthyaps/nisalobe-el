**Text Option A**

My father and mother, who were at the station waiting for their daughter, rushed in my direction as soon as they saw me, and talking Indian as fast as they could tried to help me from the train.

My father took my valise, and my mother, seizing me by the arm, threw her head upon my shoulder and cried for joy.

Was I as glad to see them as I thought I would be?

I must confess that instead I was shocked and surprised at the sight that met my eyes. “My father? My mother?” cried I desperately within. “No, never I!” I thought, and I actually turned my back upon them. I had forgotten that home Indians had such grimy faces.

I had forgotten that my mother’s hair always looked as though it had never seen a comb.

I had forgotten that she wore such a short, queer-looking black bag for a dress, fastened over one shoulder only, and such buckskin wrappings for shoes and leggings.

“My mother?” I cried, this time aloud.

I could not help it, and at the same time I rushed frantically into the arms of my school-mother, who had taken me home, and I remembered then as I never did before how kind she had always been to us. I threw my arms around her neck and cried bitterly, and begged her to let me get on the train again.

I also took my father’s hand, and through my tears smiled as best I could; but he never shall know how I suffered with mortification and regret that he was such an Indian. Somehow, I had my mind made up that my parents would be different, and it was hard for me to realize that they had been going backwards while I had been going forward for five years . . . I had unconsciously spoken in English. Indeed, I could not speak much Indian, and as my father and mother knew no English, my ride home was almost a silent one as far as I was concerned, but my father and mother talked as they rode along, my father on another burro at our side. I listened carefully to see if the Indian words would not come back to me, and some of them did.

**Text Option A**

When the train stopped at the station there was a great crowd of white people there. It was but three years after the killing of Custer by the Sioux, so the white people were anxious to see some Sioux Indians. I suppose many of these people expected to see us coming with scalping-knives between our teeth, bows and arrows in one hand and tomahawk in the other, and to hear a great war-cry as we came off that Iron Horse . . . The place where we stopped was called Sioux City. The white people were yelling at us and making a great noise . . . Many of the little Indian boys and girls were afraid of the white people. I really do not blame them because the whites acted so wild at seeing us. They tried to give the war-whoop and mimic the Indian and in other ways got us all wrought up and excited, and we did not like this sort of treatment . . . The white people were all crowded up close to the windows on the outside, watching us and laughing their heads off at the way we acted (104–105).

So lonesome I felt for my father and mother! I stayed upstairs all by myself, thinking of the good times I might be having if I were only back home, where I could ride my ponies, go wherever I wanted to and do as I pleased, and, when it came night, could lie down and sleep well. Right then and there I learned that no matter how humble your home is, it is yet home (111).

I now began to realize that I would have to learn the ways of the white man. With this idea in mind, the thought also came to me that I must please my father as well. So my little brain began to work hard. I thought that someday I might be able to become an interpreter for my father, as he could not speak English. Or I thought I might be able to keep books for him if he again started a store. So I worked very hard. One day they selected a few boys and told us we were to learn trades. I was to be a tinsmith. I did not care for this, but I tried my best to learn this trade. Mr. Walker was our instructor. I was getting along very well. I made hundreds of tin cups, coffee pots, and buckets. These were sent away and issued to the Indians on various reservations. After I had left the school and returned home, this trade did not benefit me any, as the Indians had plenty of tinware that I had made at school (117).

I remember being dragged out, though I resisted by kicking and scratching wildly. In spite of myself, I was carried downstairs and tied fast in a chair.

I cried aloud, shaking my head all the while until I felt the cold blades of the scissors against my neck, and heard them gnaw off one of my thick braids. Then I lost my spirit. Since the day I was taken from my mother I had suffered extreme indignities. People had stared at me. I had been tossed about in the air like a wooden puppet. And now my long hair was shingled like a coward’s! In my anguish I moaned for my mother, but no one came to comfort me. Not a soul reasoned quietly with me, as my own mother used to do; for now I was only one of many little animals driven by a herder.

It was night when we reached the school grounds. The lights from the windows of the large buildings fell upon some of the icicled trees that stood beneath them. We were led toward an open door, where the brightness of the lights within flooded out over the heads of the excited palefaces who blocked the way. My body trembled more from fear than from the snow I trod upon . . . I had arrived in the wonderful land of rosy skies, but I was not happy, as I had thought I should be. My long travel and the bewildering sights had exhausted me. I fell asleep, heaving deep, tired sobs. My tears were left to dry themselves in streaks, because neither my aunt nor my mother was near to wipe them away.

When we entered the Mission School, we experienced a greater hardship, for there we encountered a rule that prohibited the use of our own language, which rule was rigidly enforced with a hickory rod, so that the new-comer, however socially inclined, was obliged to go about like a little dummy until he had learned to express himself in English.

They were a sad lot, this little crowd of babies; they seldom laughed or smiled and often cried and whimpered during the day and at night . . . these little waifs were even more wretched than we were . . . they were hunched in their wretchedness and misery in a corner.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

“Line up!”

Two serpentine columns of listless boys formed.

“Okay! Quietly!”

But though tongues were quiet, boots beat down on the metal stairs, so that stairs, windows and railings rattled and reverberated from the bottom of the stairwell to the ceiling on the third floor.

In the recreation hall downstairs the boys either stood around in knots or sat slouched on the top board that served as a bench as well as a lid for the boxes that were built into the wall. But as I was to learn later, the boys were not really waiting in the commonly understood sense of the word “wait.” Though they may have appeared to be waiting, the boys were in reality exercising a form of quiet disobedience directed against bells, priests, school and, in the abstract, all authority, civil and religious.

Since the boys could not openly defy authority either by walking out of the school and marching north or south on Highway 17 or by flatly refusing to follow an order, they turned to the only means available to them: passive resistance, which took the form of dawdling.

“Father. Someone made a mistake. I’m supposed to be in Grade 6. I passed Grade 5 already.”  
I tol’ Father Buck, but he won’t believe me.”

Father Mayhew just looked at me. I’m told you’re in Grade 5. There’s nothing that you can do about it.”

But my appointment to Grade 5, as I learned years later, was not a product of misunderstanding but a coldly calculated decision made “for my own good.” For if I had been allowed to proceed to Grade 6 as I should have been, it would have disrupted the entire promotion and graduation schedule that decreed that all boys committed to a residential school remain in the institution until age sixteen, or until their parents, if living together, arranged an early parole. If I had progressed at my normal rate through elementary school I would have been ready for “entrance examinations” by age twelve. According to the administration it would not have been appropriate or in the best interests of society to release me or any one of my colleagues prior to age sixteen. The only solution was to have a boy repeat grades until Grade 8 and age sixteen were synchronized.

**Text Option D**

But thoughts of family and home did not yield much comfort and strength; instead such memories as one had served to inflame the feelings of alienation and abandonment and to fan the flames of resentment. Soon the silence was broken by the sobs and whimpers of boys who gave way to misery and sadness, dejection and melancholy, heartache and gloom.

The next thing I remember with clarity was our arrival in the late afternoon at the schools. After my sister was deposited at St Joseph’s, I did not see her for another six weeks. As for me . . . I was driven to Saint Peter Claver’s school . . . All the boys were dressed alike in beige corduroy riding breeches, beige shirts, gray woolen socks and black leather work boots; all were dark and dirty, their heads shaved bald. Every one of them stared and grinned.

Through this crowd a priest made his way to the car. The agents told him who I was and where I came from. ‘I’m Father Book!’ he said. ‘Come with me.’

With fear and misgiving I followed the priest to the third floor, where he ordered me to shed my clothing. He handed me a bar of carbolic soap and shoved me into a shower. ‘Scrub. Scrub hard’ . . .

When I emerged from this purge, Father Buck gave me a small green bag with my uniform inside and a pair of work boots. After I had dressed, my guide led me to the dormitory where he assigned me a bed in the junior section.

‘You are number forty-three,’ he informed me, prodding me downstairs, so that I stumbled on the metal-topped risers and almost fell.”

**Text Option F**

In we filed and, for the next twenty minutes or a little longer, gave ourselves wholeheartedly to pea soup, bread, lard and green tea from Java. In quantity served there was just enough food to blunt the sharp edge of hunger for three or four hours, never enough to dispel hunger completely until the next meal. Every crumb was eaten and the last morsel of bread was used to sponge up any residue of soup that might still be clinging to the sides or to the bottom of the plates, thereby leaving the plates clean and dry, the way puppies lick their dishes clean. There was the same quantity for every boy, regardless of size or need. Yet not even the ‘little shots’, whose ingestive capacities were considerably less than those of their elders and who therefore should have required and received less, were ever heard to extol a meal with ‘I’m full’. ‘I’m full’ was an expression alien  
in our world and to our experience.

**Text Option G**

Never having the luxury of a second serving or an extra slice, the boys formed a healthy regard for food that bordered on reverence that shaped their eating habits . . . Meals became rituals almost as solemn as religious services in their intensity, the only sound the clatter of spoons on plates and mugs and the muted ‘Pass the mush’ or ‘You owe me a slice’; ‘When you going to pay me that lard you owe me?’ ‘I’m so hungry right now, can you wait till tomorrow?’

By comparison with courses of study in other schools, our curriculum would have been regarded as below standard. It’s true that we did not have access to a well-stocked library, or attend classes from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. It’s also true that we were taught to know what to do with what little we knew; we were taught to be resourceful. But unless one has a sense of worth and dignity, resourcefulness, intelligence and shrewdness are of little advantage.

“Drums”

From the Indian reservation to the governmental school,

Well they’re going to educate me to the White man’s Golden Rule.

And I am learning quickly, for I’ve learned to be ashamed.

And I come when they call “Billy” though I’ve got an Indian name.

But there are drums beyond the mountain. Indian drums that you can’t hear.

There are drums beyond the mountain, and they’re getting mighty near.

Now when they think that they’d changed me, cut my hair to meet their needs,

Will they think I’m white or Indian, quarter blood or just half breed?

Say, let me tell you, Mr. Teacher, who is going to make me “right,”

In six hundred years of fighting not one Indian turned white.

Well, you thought that I knew nothing when you brought me here to school.

Just another empty Indian, just America’s first fool.

But I can tell you stories that are burnt and dried and old.

And in the shadow of their telling walks the thunder, brave and bold.

Why, there’s Long Pine and Sequoia, Handsome Lake and Sitting Bull,

There’s Mangas Colorado with his sleeves so red and full,

There goes Crazy Horse, the legend, and those who bit off Custer’s soul.

They are dead, yet they are living with the great Geronimo.

Well, you may teach me this land’s history, but we taught it to you first.

We broke your hearts, we bent your journeys; broken treaties left us cursed.

Even now you have to cheat us even though you think us tame.

In our losing we found proudness; in your winning you found shame.

“I Lost My Talk”

I lost my talk

The talk you took away.

When I was a little girl

At Shubenacadie school.

You snatched it away:

I speak like you

I think like you

I create like you

The scrambled ballad, about my world.

Two ways I talk

Both ways I say,

Your way is more powerful.

So gently I offer my hand and as,k

Let me find my talk

So I can teach you about me.

“Indian Boarding School: The Runaways”

Home’s the place we head for in our sleep.

Boxcars stumbling north in dreams

don’t wait for us. We catch them on the run.

The rails, old lacerations that we love,

shoot parallel across the face and break

just under Turtle Mountains. Riding scars

you can’t get lost. Home is the place they cross.

The lame guard strikes a match and makes the dark

less tolerant. We watch through cracks in boards

as the land starts rolling, rolling till it hurts

to be here, cold in regulation clothes.

We know the sheriff’s waiting at midrun

to take us back. His car is dumb and warm.

The highway doesn’t rock, it only hums

like a wing of long insults. The worn-down welts

of ancient punishments lead back and forth.

All runaways wear dresses, long green ones,

the color you would think shame was. We scrub

the sidewalks down because it’s shameful work.

Our brushes cut the stone in watered arcs

and in the soak frail outlines shiver clear

a moment, things us kids pressed on the dark

face before it hardened, pale, remembering

delicate old injuries, the spines of names and leaves.

But the time that really, really gets to the bottom of my soul; the first day back . . .

In my time, we were always hungry . . . I seen them bringing in boxes and boxes of apples not too far from the dairy room.

We tied the strings together and there was an airhole in the root cellar. So we have all these girls watching out for us . . . and we try to spike apples. That’s how we used to get our apples to feed the little ones. . . We got caught and we got punished but it took a long time because we supported each other in our crime.

I can remember Dad left really early that morning ‘cause he never, ever wanted to see us go off to school. And when he left that morning at five, I tried sneaking out with him.

I want to stay with you.” And I was crying just as hard as he was. Finally, I just wrapped my arms and legs right around him and every time he went to take a step, he had to pack me with him ‘cause I was hanging on to him so hard. He walked back in the house and pulled me off of him and sat me on the couch and he finally yelled at me, “You sit right there and don’t you move until them people come.” But he was crying. He walked out and he got on his horse and went and left. That was really hard to take, you know . . . (Linda, Lillooett Tribal Nation)

In the morning, we had to get up at six o’clock, perfect silence. We all took turns going into the bathroom: we’d fill our basin full of water and we’d take it to our bedside.
