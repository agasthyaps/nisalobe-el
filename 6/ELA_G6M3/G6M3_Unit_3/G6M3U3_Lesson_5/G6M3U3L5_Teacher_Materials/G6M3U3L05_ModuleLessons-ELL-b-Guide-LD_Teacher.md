5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

RI.6.5, W.6.1b, SL.6.1, L.6.1c, L.6.3a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

Even though Pop has some bad memories of the discipline at Challagi, **the other Creek boys he met at Challagi “were some of the best buddies \[he\] ever had” (107).** (from Proof Paragraph 2 of the model literary argument essay)

**Lesson 5 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after students analyze Proof Paragraph 2 of the model essay during Work Time A.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target **(I can analyze the structure of Proof Paragraph 2 of the model)** and W.6.1b by featuring evidence that supports the reason presented in Proof Paragraph 2 of the model essay. The sentence also helps students to address L.6.1c by using brackets to indicate a shift in pronoun person and RI.6.5 by serving an important function in the structure of the larger paragraph. Supporting standards: SL.6.1, L.6.3a.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses an embedded partial quote from *Two Roads*. This quote includes brackets to indicate a shift in perspective.

- Transfer: Embedded quotes to cite textual evidence in their own collaborative and independent argument essays.

- Note: Students can refer to the Model Literary Argument Essay from Unit 3, Lesson 1 as needed to answer the questions in this Mini Language Dive.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **Even though Pop has some bad memories of the discipline at Challagi, <u>the other Creek boys he met at Challagi “were some of the best buddies \[he\] ever had” (107).</u>**

- Ask:

“What is this sentence about?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **the other Creek boys he met at Challagi “were some of the best buddies \[he\] ever had” (107).**

- Ask:

“What do the quotation marks tell us about this chunk?” (The quotation marks tell us that the chunk uses words taken directly from Two Roads.)

“Can you figure out why the quotation marks do not include the whole chunk within them?” (Because the quote from the text is only a partial quote.)

- Invite students to locate the original quotation on page 107 of *Two Roads*: **“Those boys in our Creek gang were some of the best buddies I ever had.”**

“What is different about the original quote in the text and the embedded quote in the model essay?” (The original quote includes a subject, Those boys in our Creek gang. It also includes the pronoun I instead of he.)

“Based on these differences in pronoun, what is the purpose of the brackets within the quoted part of the chunk?” (The brackets allow us to change a word within the quote.)

“How would the quote be different if the original pronoun I had been used instead of the bracketed pronoun he?” (It would make the pronoun person confusing. It would make it seem like the boys in Pop’s gang were the <u>author’s</u> friends, not Pop’s.)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **Even though Pop has some bad memories of the discipline at Challagi, <u>the other Creek boys he met at Challagi “were some of the best buddies \[he\] ever had” (107).</u>**

- Ask:

“Why is it important to include text quotations in a literary argument essay?” (Text quotations serve as evidence, and evidence supports our reasons, which in turn support our main claims.)

“Why might it sometimes be more effective to use partial text quotations rather than full sentences?” (Partial text quotations might be more effective because they allow us to use mostly our own words.)

“How does the quoted text evidence support the reason presented in Proof Paragraph 2?” (The text evidence gives an example of something that was good for Pop at Challagi. This helps support the idea that Challagi would be good for Cal, too.)

- If needed, display the topic sentence of Proof Paragraph 2: **The second reason why it is best for Cal to stay behind is because Challagi may actually be good for Cal.**

“How does this sentence function within the larger structure of the paragraph?” (This sentence provides the ‘proof’ of the Proof Paragraph. It offers text evidence that supports the larger reason.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target:  
I can analyze the structure of Proof Paragraph 2 of the model?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display the following sentence frame and *Two Roads* quote:

> **Even though Pop and Cal would miss each other, Pop believed that Challagi was the best way for Cal to “\_\_\_\_\_\_\_” (\_\_\_).**
>
> “That way you can make use of your time while I’m in Washington—which is no place for a boy to be” (110).

- Ask:

“Use part of the quotation above to complete the sentence frame. You may need to use brackets so that you can change a pronoun. Don’t forget to include a citation in parentheses at the end.”

- Possible student answers:

> **<u>Even though Pop and Cal would miss each other, Pop believed that Challagi was the best way for Cal to “make use of \[his\] time” (110).</u>**
