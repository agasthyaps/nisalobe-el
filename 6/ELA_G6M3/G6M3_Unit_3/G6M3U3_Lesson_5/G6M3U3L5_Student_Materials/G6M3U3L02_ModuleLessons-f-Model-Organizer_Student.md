**Name:** **Date:**

**Focus Question: Should Pop bring Cal to Washington, DC with him?**

**Introduction Paragraph**

How will you catch the reader’s attention? (Consider using facts, statistics, quotations, or anecdotes)

**Introduce Cal and Pop: camping/hopping trains**

What context about the text or topic does your reader need in order to make sense of the rest of your essay? Include a brief mention of opposing position (what is the <u>other</u> claim someone could make?).

**Why is Pop going to Washington? (tell about campaign)**

**Why does Pop want to send Cal to Challagi?**

**Why is this decision hard for Pop?**

**Pop could choose to bring Cal instead because it makes Cal sad to imagine being without him.**

Main Claim: **Pop should not bring Cal to Washington with him.**

**Proof Paragraph 1**

Point 1: What is the first point or reason you are offering to support your claim?

**Cal is too young to participate in the campaign.**

Context: What context does the reader need to understand the evidence you are using?

**What will the campaign look like? (Why is it dangerous?)**

**Why is the campaign important?**

**Why does Pop want to go alone? (worries about Cal)**

Evidence: What evidence from the text supports this point or reason?

**“If this is going to be a campaign, then I have to go it without you. It might be dangerous and I want you safe while I’m gone” (59). (Pop to Cal)**

**Thousands of veterans in campaign, working together as “an army” (94).**

**Cal “not ready yet to be part of any army” (94).**

**Pop wants Cal to be “safe with three hots and a cot” (94) at Challagi.**

Reasoning: How does this evidence connect to and support your point? How does your point prove your claim?

**Not appropriate for Cal to go to Washington with Pop and participate in the campaign.**

**Too many veterans, all adults, fighting for an issue that Cal is too young to understand.**

**Pop worries about Cal, needs to focus on the goals of the campaign.**

**Proof Paragraph 2**

Point 2: What is the second point or reason you are offering to support your claim?

**Challagi is a better alternative for Cal.**

Context: What context does the reader need to understand the evidence you are using?

**What is Challagi? (a boarding school for American Indian students).**

**Why Challagi? (no other options where Cal can stay and be safe, have food)**

Evidence: What evidence from the text supports this point or reason?

**Challagi is the only place that would give Cal “not just an education but also food every day and a roof over \[his\] head” (94).**

**Good education – industrial and academic classes.**

**Cal can make friends: “‘Those boys in our Creek gang were some of the best buddies I ever had’” (107).**

Reasoning: How does this evidence connect to and support your point? How does your point prove your claim?

**Cal will have food and shelter.**

**It is safer for him at Challagi than in Washington with Pop or on the road by himself.**

**Education opportunities.**

**Cal does not have any friends or family besides Pop – can make friends at Challagi.**

**Conclusion Paragraph**

Restate your claim from the introduction.

**The best way for Pop to accomplish his goals is to go to Washington, DC alone, without Cal.**

Briefly restate your main points:

Point 1: **Pop wants to help veterans get what they deserve**

Point 2: **Pop wants Cal to be safe and educated**

What are your further reflections on this topic?

- Why does this argument/claim matter?

- What would happen if this claim were not acted upon?

- Who is likely to benefit from this?

**Cal and Pop make a good team, and they will miss each other a lot. Still, it is better for both of them if Pop does not bring Cal to Washington, DC. They will reunite soon after and begin a better life.**
