Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.6.8 – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they trace and evaluate the argument and evidence presented in a possible Proof Paragraph for the model essay.

- W.6.1b – Opening A: Students revise a sample Proof Paragraph to include additional relevant evidence that supports the main claim.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time A: Students analyze the second Proof Paragraph of the model literary argument essay, examining how reasons have been supported with cited textual evidence.

- RI.6.5 – Work Time A: Students analyze the second Proof Paragraph, identifying the function of each sentence within the argument structure of the paragraph.

- RI.6.8 – Work Time A: Students trace and evaluate the specific reasons presented in the second Proof Paragraph of the model essay.

- W.6.1b – Work Time A: Students analyze the structure of the second Proof Paragraph of the model essay in preparation to write the second Proof Paragraphs of their collaborative essays, which will present clear reasons and relevant evidence to support a claim.

- W.6.1c – Work Time A: Students analyze the second Proof Paragraph of the model essay, noting ways in which words, phrases, and clauses clarify the relationships between the claim and the reasons.

- RL.6.1 – Work Time B: Students use textual evidence from *Two Roads* to present and support the reason presented in the second Proof Paragraph of their collaborative literary argument essays.

- W.6.1a – Work Time B: Students draft the second Proof Paragraphs of their collaborative literary argument essays, carefully organizing the reason and its supporting evidence.

- W.6.1b – Work Time B: In their Proof Paragraphs, student support the main claims of their essays with clear reasons and relevant evidence from *Two Roads*.

- W.6.4 – Work Time B: Students produce clear and coherent Proof Paragraphs for their collaborative literary argument essays.

- W.6.5 – Work Time B: With support from their partners, students develop strong Proof Paragraphs for their collaborative literary argument essays.

- W.6.9a – Work Time B: Students use textual evidence to support the reason presented in the second Proof Paragraph of their collaborative literary argument essays.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- An optional Mini Language Dive, intended for use after analyzing Proof Paragraph 2 in Work Time A, is available in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Encourage students to incorporate some of the vocabulary they have collected throughout this module into their essays.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Students have been analyzing a model and using their analysis to draft the introduction and Proof Paragraph 1 of an Argument essay. This lesson continues those routines to guide students in drafting Proof Paragraph 2.

Support All Students

- Releasing collaborative supports in order to write a Proof Paragraph independently may challenge some students more than others. Remind students of the similar activities they have completed in class and emphasize the usefulness of the completed Writing Plan graphic organizer as a thinking tool.

- To support ELLs, this lesson follows a similar pattern to Lessons 3 and 4 with scaffolded tasks that guide students from analysis of a model to their own collaborative writing. The repeated steps of analyzing a model essay, both within this unit and across modules, supports ELLs by clarifying expectations and reducing the cognitive overload that comes from learning new tasks. Another Mini Language Dive also supports ELLs by providing opportunities to practice weaving textual evidence into their argument essays.

- ELLs may find it challenging to effectively embed quotes as evidence to support the reasons they name in their Proof Paragraphs, as this requires a sophisticated understanding of grammatical and orthographic rules. The lesson’s Mini Language Dive offers a scaffolded opportunity for students to practice quoting the text and embedding partial quotes into their essays. Review students’ work throughout the Mini Language Dive and during the construction of their own essays to ensure that they are selecting meaningful quotes and inserting them effectively into their own Proof Paragraphs.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.4, 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.7, 6.I.C.10, 6.I.C.11, 6.I.C.12, 6.II.A.1, 6.II.A.2, 6.II.B.5, 6.II.C.6, and 6.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- Consider using the Grade 6 Writing Process checklist located on the Tools Page (http://eled.org/tools) to assess students’ writing abilities in Work Time B.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will draft the conclusion of their collaborative essay. For the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment, students will follow the same process to independently plan and write a literary argument essay about a different issue from *Two Roads*.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.6.8 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 5**. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 5 (answers for teacher reference)** for possible responses.

- Using a total participation technique, invite students to share their responses to the questions on the entrance ticket. Clarify any misunderstandings and respond to any outstanding questions.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar to or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Analyze a Model: Proof Paragraph 2 – RI.6.8, W.6.1b, W.6.1c (20 minutes)

- Ask students to retrieve their **Model Literary Argument Essay**.

- Distribute and display the **Analyze Model Proof Paragraph 2** handout. Read the directions aloud and field any questions.

- Direct students to pair up and complete the items on the Analyze Model Proof Paragraph 2 handout.

- Using a total participation technique, review the answers. Refer to **Analyze Model Proof Paragraph 2 (answers for teacher reference).** Clarify any misunderstandings and respond to any outstanding questions.

- Turn and Talk:

“What examples of transition words or phrases appear in this paragraph?” (the second reason, even though, so, also, plus, even if, even)

“What is the purpose of these words and phrases? How would the paragraph be different if they weren’t included?” (They show how all the parts of the argument (claim, reason, evidence, and reasoning) go together and connect to create the argument. It would be harder for a reader to understand how all the pieces work together to support the argument. These words and phrases let the reader better understand the writer’s thinking and follow her argument.)

“What do you notice about the number of sentences that contain evidence and the number that contain reasoning? Why might this be important?” (There are more sentences that contain reasoning than evidence. This is important because the author should include more of her own original thoughts to explain her thinking rather than relying on the reader to figure out the connection between the evidence and the reason or claim.)

- Explain that while they are writing the second support paragraph for their collaborative essay, they should also work on ensuring they include transitional words and phrases to better convey their thinking and their argument.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time A, after students analyze Proof Paragraph 2 of the Model Literary Argument Essay, invite students to participate in a Mini Language Dive in small groups to analyze a partial quote used as text evidence in the paragraph (W.6.1b). This Mini Language Dive also helps students better understand the function of individual sentences within the larger structure of an argument essay (RI.6.5) and provides an opportunity for students to identify an appropriate shift in pronoun person (L.6.1c).

- During the Mini Language Dive, invite students who need lighter support to use a more minimal sentence frame during the Practice section:

- Even though \_\_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ “\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_” (\_\_\_\_).

For Heavier Support

- As an extension to the Mini Language Dive of Work Time A, create an activity that helps students who need heavier support better understand how to embed partial quotes into their own writing. Consider providing students with a list of quotes and frames as practice. For example:

- “When one door of happiness closes, another opens.” Helen Keller

- Sometimes, when I am having a bad day, I try to remember that “\_\_\_\_\_” (Helen Keller).

- “I’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.” (Maya Angelou)

- It is important to be kind to people because they “\_\_\_\_” (Maya Angelou).

- “As much as I loved being back with my father, I was also missing the boys in our Creek gang.” (page 314 of *Two Roads*)

- Cal loved being with his father again, but he “\_\_\_\_\_” (314).

Work Time

B. Collaborative Writing: Draft Proof Paragraph 2 – W.6.1b, W.6.1c (15 minutes)

- Move students into writing pairs.

- Display and invite students to retrieve their **Collaborative Literary Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer** and their copy of the **Argument Writing checklist**.

- Explain that students will continue to work with their writing partner to draft Proof Paragraph 2 of their **collaborative literary argument essays**. Direct them to ensure they are using transition words to help show the relationships among their reasons, evidence, and reasoning.

- Students should base their draft on the information they gathered and organized on their **Collaborative Literary Argument Evidence note-catcher** and Collaborative Literary Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer. Direct students to use the Model Literary Argument Essay, **Model Literary Argument Evidence note-catcher**, and **Model Literary Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer** to also help them draft. Point out the correlation between the information in the evidence note-catcher and what appears in the planner for Proof Paragraph 1.

- Distribute **lined paper** or **devices**, and invite writing partners to begin.

- Circulate and monitor, referencing the following resources as necessary:

- **Collaborative Literary Argument Evidence note-catcher (example for teacher reference)**

- **Collaborative Literary Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer (example for teacher reference)**

- **Collaborative Literary Argument Writing: Annotated (for teacher reference)**

- With 2 minutes remaining, refocus students and allow time for them to log off devices or put away materials.

- Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target, using a checking for understanding technique. Scan student responses, and make a note of students who might need support. Check in with them moving forward.

For Lighter Support

- Students can insert their completed sentences directly into their Proof Paragraph 2 during Work Time B.

For Heavier Support

Closing and Assessment

A. Reflect on Learning – SL.6.1 (5 minutes)

- Move students into groups of three or four, and have them reread each of the **Habits of Character anchor charts**.

- Invite students to reflect on how habits of character were demonstrated in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Review Independent Reading Journal

- Students review their **independent reading journal** entries in preparation for the independent reading research share in the next lesson.
