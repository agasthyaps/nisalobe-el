**Focus Question:** Should Cal leave Challagi Indian Industrial School to find Pop?

**Introduction Paragraph**

How will you catch the reader’s attention? (Consider using facts, statistics, quotations, or anecdotes.)

Introduce the situation–Cal’s feelings about Challagi, Pop’s stories.

What context about the text or topic does your reader need in order to make sense of the rest of your essay? Include a brief mention of opposing position (what is the other claim someone could make?).

Why was Cal at Challagi to begin with? (Pop went to Washington for veterans’ campaign)

How does Cal feel about Challagi? (nervous, never been away from Pop)

How does Pop feel about Challagi? (good memories of friends, bad memories of discipline)

What happened at Challagi? (Cal made good friends, Cal had a premonition of Pop being hurt)

Cal could choose not to leave the school to find Pop because it’s so dangerous.

Main Claim:

Cal should leave school to find Pop.

**Proof Paragraph 1**

Point 1: What is the first point or reason you are offering to support your claim?

Cal had a vision that Pop is going to get hurt.

Context: What context does the reader need to understand the evidence you are using?

Cal has had many visions before—vivid and realistic, often about Pop.

Evidence: What evidence from the text supports this point or reason?

This is the first vision about something in the future, not the past. Has worried about Pop the whole time, but this was the first vision.

Reasoning: How does this evidence connect to and support your point? How does your point prove your claim?

Cal has worried about Pop the whole time, but stayed at Challagi. This premonition scared him – must be something more than just missing Pop.

Proof Paragraph 2

Point 2: What is the second point or reason you are offering to support your claim?

Cal might be able to stop the events of the vision.

Context: What context does the reader need to understand the evidence you are using?

Cal’s friend Deacon has visions too, learned many things from his grandfather.

Evidence: What evidence from the text supports this point or reason?

Deacon knew Cal was going to have a vision before he even had it. Deacon’s grandfather—visions can show what might happen, not what has -to happen.

Reasoning: How does this evidence connect to and support your point? How does your point prove your claim?

There is an opportunity for Cal to intervene and save Pop.

If there’s a chance the vision is real, Cal has to try to help.

**Conclusion Paragraph**

Restate your claim from the introduction.

Cal should leave Challagi to find Pop.

Briefly restate your main points:

Point 1:

Cal had a premonition that Pop is going to be hurt.

Point 2:

Cal might be able to prevent the vision from coming true.

What are your further reflections on this topic?

- Why does this argument/claim matter?

- What would happen if this claim were not acted upon?

- Who is likely to benefit from this?

Could be a matter of life and death.

If Cal does not act upon this, Pop could be in danger.
