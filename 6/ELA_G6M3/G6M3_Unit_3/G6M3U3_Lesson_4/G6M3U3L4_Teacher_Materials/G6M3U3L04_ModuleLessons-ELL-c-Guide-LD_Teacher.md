5-Minute Mini Language Dive Guide

RI.6.1, RI.6.5, W.6.1b, W.6.1d, SL.6.1

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

- **The first reason why Pop should not bring Cal to Washington** is that Cal is too young to participate in the events of this important campaign. (from Proof Paragraph 1 of the **Model Literary Argument Essay**)

**Lesson 4 Placement**

Lead this Mini Language Dive after students analyze Proof Paragraph 1 of the model essay during Work Time A.

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps students to address the daily learning target (**I can determine the characteristics of an effective support paragraph by analyzing the model**) and W.6.1b by reiterating the model essay’s main claim and conveying the first reason that supports the claim. The sentence also helps students address RI.6.5 by offering opportunities to analyze the function of the sentence within the larger structure of the essay and W.6.1d by featuring elements typical of formal academic writing (e.g., information density; complex noun phrases and simple verbs). Supporting standards: RI.6.1, SL.6.1.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses a copular verb (**is**) to connect a dense noun phrase with a subordinate clause.

- Transfer: **The first reason why** + independent clause + **is that** + independent clause to convey the first reason that supports their claim in Proof Paragraph 1 of their collaborative and independent literary argument essays.

- Note: Students can refer to the Model Literary Argument Essay from Unit 3, Lesson 1 as needed to answer the questions in this Mini Language Dive.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the sentence: **<u>The first reason why Pop should not bring Cal to Washington</u> is that Cal is too young to participate in the events of this important campaign.**

- Ask:

“What is this sentence about?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- Read aloud the focus structure: **The first reason why Pop should not bring Cal to Washington**

- Ask:

“How does this chunk connect to the main claim of the essay?” (It introduces a reason that supports the main claim.)

“What is the purpose and impact of the words The first reason why in this chunk?” (The purpose of the words The first reason why is to signal to the reader that the paragraph is going to present a reason that supports the main claim of the essay. The impact is that the reader is prepared and knows what to expect.)

Reconstruct

- Read aloud the entire sentence on display: **<u>The first reason why Pop should not bring Cal to Washington</u> is that Cal is too young to participate in the events of this important campaign.**

- Ask:

“What about this sentence indicates that it is an example of academic writing?” (Responses may vary, but students may point out that the sentence is clear and direct, it uses textual evidence and formal language, it has complex noun phrases.)

“What do you notice about the subject in this sentence?” (Responses may vary, but students may point out that the subject, The first reason why Pop should not bring Cal to Washington, is long and dense or is a noun phrase.)

“What do you notice about the main verb in this sentence?” (Responses may vary, but students may point out that the main verb, is, is a simple, familiar verb.)

“What do you notice about what comes after the main verb, is?” (Responses may vary, but students may point out that what follows is a long subordinate clause beginning with that.)

- Point out that academic writing is generally information dense. It packs a lot of information into its sentences. Often, academic writing contains complex noun phrases and simple verbs, like **is**. See Lesson 4 of the Teacher’s Guide for English Language Learners for an extension activity that further develops students’ understanding of academic writing.

- Students can refer to their **Model Literary Argument Essays** to answer the questions below.

- Ask:

“How does this sentence fit into the larger structure of the Proof Paragraph?” (It introduces the Proof Paragraph. It states a clear reason, which the remainder of the Proof Paragraph supports with evidence and reasoning.)

“How does this sentence fit into the larger structure of the overall essay?” (The essay is making an argument as to why Pop should not bring Cal with him to Washington. This sentence gives the primary reason for that argument.)

“Based on this Mini Language Dive, how do you think Proof Paragraph 2 of the model essay might begin?” (Responses may include: The second reason why Pop should not bring Cal to Washington is . . .)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target:  
I can determine the characteristics of an effective support paragraph by analyzing the model?” (Responses will vary.)

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

> **The first reason why Cal should \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

verb phrase independent clause

(noun phrase + **is** + **that** + independent phrase)

- Say:

“Work with your collaborative writing partners to complete this frame to produce a clear reason that defends your argument. This can be the opening sentence in your first Proof Paragraphs.”

- Possible student answers:

> **The first reason why Cal should <u>not leave the school to go find Pop</u> is that <u>he promised Pop he would stay at Challagi and wait for him</u>.**
