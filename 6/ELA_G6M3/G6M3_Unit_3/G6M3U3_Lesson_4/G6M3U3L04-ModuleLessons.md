Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.6.1 – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they clarify the meanings of key terms about argument writing structure: *main claim, reason, evidence,* and *reasoning*.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time A: Students analyze the first Proof Paragraph of the model literary argument essay, examining how reasons have been supported with cited textual evidence.

- RI.6.8 – Work Time A: Students trace and evaluate the specific reasons presented in the first Proof Paragraph of the model essay.

- W.6.1b – Work Time A: Students analyze the structure of the first Proof Paragraph of the model essay in preparation to write the first Proof Paragraphs of their collaborative essays, which will present clear reasons and relevant evidence to support a claim.

- RL.6.1 – Work Time B: Students use textual evidence from *Two Roads* to present and support the reason presented in the first Proof Paragraph of their collaborative literary argument essays.

- W.6.1a – Work Time B: Students draft the first Proof Paragraphs of their collaborative literary argument essays, carefully organizing the reason and its supporting evidence.

- W.6.1b – Work Time B: In their Proof Paragraphs, students support the main claims of their essays with clear reasons and relevant evidence from *Two Roads*.

- W.6.4 – Work Time B: Students produce clear and coherent Proof Paragraphs for their collaborative literary argument essays.

- W.6.5 – Work Time B: With support from their partners, students develop strong Proof Paragraphs for their collaborative literary argument essays.

- W.6.9a – Work Time B: Students use textual evidence to support the reason presented in the first Proof Paragraph of their collaborative literary argument essays.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- An optional Mini Language Dive, intended for use after students analyze Proof Paragraph 1 in Work Time A, is available in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Challenge students to flesh out the Proof Paragraph 1 with more evidence and reasoning. Encourage students to pull information from their note-catchers.

- Using a variety of vocabulary strategies, invite students to determine the meaning of the word campaign as it is used in the model essay.

- Allow students to manipulate sentences from the model essay, trying different combinations to make simple and complex sentences.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lessons, students planned their collaborative essay using their writing planner and drafted their introduction. They build on those foundations in this lesson by drafting the first Proof Paragraph focused on the first reason to support their main claim.

Support All Students

- Note that there is a differentiated version of the Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 4 used in Opening A. ▲

- This lesson involves multiple transitions between activities. Use alerts and previews to help learners anticipate and prepare for changes in activities.

- To support ELLs, this lesson continues to build upon students’ understanding of the literary argument essay by walking students through the purpose and structure of Proof Paragraph 1 in the model literary argument essay. The proof paragraph analysis activity takes place as a full class, with embedded Turn and Talks, giving students both instructor and peer support. Questioning throughout the analysis encourages students to draw connections among the model and their own collaborative and independent essays; the direct applicability of the model analysis is especially supportive for ELLs who need heavier support in their own academic writing. An optional but encouraged Mini Language Dive invites students to analyze the topic sentence (i.e., the main reason) of Proof Paragraph 1; the practice section of the Mini Language Dive supports ELLs by equipping them with a sentence that can be immediately inserted into their own collaborative and independent essays.

- ELLs may find it challenging to differentiate among the terms *reasons*, *evidence*, and *reasoning*. An entrance ticket invites students to use their own words to describe what the main claim, the reason(s), the evidence, and the reasoning are in a literary argument essay, which may clarify confusion for students. Look for additional opportunities to support students’ understanding.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.4, 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.7, 6.I.C.10, 6.I.C.11, 6.I.C.12, 6.II.A.1, 6.II.A.2, 6.II.B.3, 6.II.B.4, 6.II.B.5, 6.II.C.6, and 6.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- Consider using the Grade 6 Writing Process checklist located on the Tools Page (http://eled.org/tools) to assess students’ writing abilities in Work Time C.

Down the Road

- Students will continue to analyze the model and draft their collaborative essay, focusing next on Proof Paragraph 2.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- During Opening A, invite students who need heavier support to use the Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 4 ▲. This resource offers an answer bank, from which students can select answers to match to the correct sentence frame.

Work Time

A. Analyze a Model: Proof Paragraph 1 – RI.6.8, W.6.1b (20 minutes)

- Display and direct students to retrieve their **Model Literary Argument Essay**.

- Ask a student to read aloud the sentence from the model’s introductory paragraph that conveys the main claim of the essay: “Although Cal feels nervous and sad that he cannot go with his father, Pop should not bring Cal to Washington with him.”

- Ask a student to read aloud the sentence from the model’s introductory paragraph that conveys the two reasons that will be used to support the main claim: “The events in Washington are not appropriate for Cal to attend, and spending some time at Challagi is a better alternative for him.”

- Assist students in numbering the sentences of the first Proof Paragraph on their copy of the model essay. Then read aloud the first Proof Paragraph of the model essay.

- Ask:

“What do you notice about this paragraph?” (It is focused around the first reason, represented with yellow, introduced in the last sentence of the introduction—that Washington DC is not an appropriate place for Cal.)

- Turn and Talk:

“What sentence from this paragraph reminds the reader about the main claim of the whole essay and conveys the first reason that supports the claim?” (the first sentence)

- Explain that the author has provided evidence to support her first reason/point and then provided reasoning for how that evidence supports the reason and how the reason supports the main claim.

- Direct students to reread the first Proof Paragraph.

- Turn and Talk:

“What sentences in the paragraph provide the evidence that supports this reason?” (2, 3, 4, and 8)

“What evidence does the writer offer to support the idea that Cal is too young to go to Washington?” (“If this is going to be a campaign, then I have to go it without you. It might be dangerous and I want you safe while I’m gone” (59). Thousands of veterans in campaign, working together as “an army” (94). Cal “not ready yet to be part of any army” (94). Pop wants Cal to be “safe with three hots and a cot” (94) at Challagi.)

- Turn and Talk, cueing students to challenge their thinking:

“What if the writer did not include this information? How would that change the reader’s understanding of the topic?” (There would not be any textual evidence to show the reader why the writer came to this conclusion about one of the reasons Cal shouldn’t go to Washington with Pop. Without evidence, there is no support for the claim and therefore, it’s not an effective argument.)

- Turn and Talk:

“What sentences in the paragraph provide the reasoning that explains how the evidence supports this reason?” (5, 6, 7, 9, and 10)

“What reasoning does the writer use?” (Not appropriate for Cal to go to Washington with Pop and participate in the campaign. Too many veterans, all adults, fighting for an issue that Cal is too young to understand. Pop worries about Cal, needs to focus on the goals of the campaign.)

- Turn and Talk, cueing students to challenge their thinking:

“What if the writer did not include this information? How would that change the reader’s understanding of the topic?” (If these sentences were not included, then it wouldn’t be clear to the reader how or why the writer is using evidence she included. Evidence alone is not enough to support the claim, and therefore, without reasoning, it’s not an effective argument.)

- Display and direct students to retrieve their **Model Literary Argument Evidence note-catcher** and **Model Literary Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer**.

- Ask:

“Look at the first Proof Paragraph on the model writing Plan graphic organizer and at the section for this reason on the model evidence note-catcher. What do you notice about the information in those two places? How might this information help you as you plan and draft your collaborative Proof Paragraph 1 and later in planning and drafting your independent essay?” (There is a lot of overlap between the content in terms of evidence and reasoning on the two documents. The Literary Argument Evidence note-catcher allows me to do a lot of thinking and pre-planning before I write and should make writing the paragraph much easier.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time A, after students analyze Proof Paragraph 1 of the Model Literary Argument Essay, invite students to participate in a Mini Language Dive in small groups to examine the key reason presented in the Proof Paragraph (W.6.1b). This Mini Language Dive also helps students better understand the function of individual sentences within the larger structure of an argument essay (RI.6.5) and the characteristics of formal academic writing (W.6.1d).

- To further support students’ understanding of the terms *reasons*, *evidence*, and *reasoning*, invite students who need lighter support to participate in a simple group discussion that requires an argument structure. Consider low-stakes prompts based on the text (e.g., Who is your favorite supporting character: Pop or Possum?), and ask students to supply reasons, textual evidence, and reasoning to support their argument.

For Heavier Support

- Consider developing an extension to the Mini Language Dive of Work Time A that helps students develop the complex noun phrases associated with academic writing. Provide sentence starters, gradually decreasing scaffolds. It might be most beneficial to provide starters that students can use in their own collaborative or independent essays. For example:

- The second reason why Cal should go to Washington to find Pop is that \_\_\_\_.

- The first reason why Cal should \_\_\_\_ is that \_\_\_\_.

- The main reason why \_\_\_\_ is that \_\_\_\_.

- To further support students’ understanding of the terms *reasons*, *evidence*, and *reasoning*, invite students who need heavier support to observe their classmates participating in a simple group discussion that requires an argument structure (see the accompanying For Lighter Support notes). Give students colored note-cards or sticky notes (e.g., red for reason, blue for evidence, yellow for reasoning) and invite them to hold up the correct card to indicate what they hear in their classmates’ arguments.

Work Time

B. Collaborative Writing: Draft Proof Paragraph 1 – W.6.1b (15 minutes)

- Display and invite students to retrieve their **Collaborative Literary Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer** and their copy of the **Argument Writing checklist**. Point out the following characteristic on the checklist:

- W.6.1b: “I support my claim with clear reasons and relevant evidence.”

- Ask:

“Are there any specific criteria you should be aware of and list in the second column on the checklist?” (I use the best evidence from Two Roads to develop the reasons in my Proof Paragraphs and to support my main claim statement.)

- As students share out, capture their responses in the Characteristics of this Argument Writing column and direct them to do the same on their copy. Refer to the **Argument Writing checklist (example for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Explain that, in this lesson, students will work with their writing partner to draft Proof Paragraph 1 of their **collaborative literary argument essays**. Students should base their draft on the information they gathered and organized on their **Collaborative Literary Argument Evidence note-catcher** and Collaborative Literary Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer. Direct students to use the Model Literary Argument Essay, Model Literary Argument Evidence note-catcher, and Model Literary Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer to also help them draft. Remind them about the correlation between the information in the evidence note-catcher and what appears in the planner for Proof Paragraph 1.

- Distribute **lined paper** or **devices**, and invite writing partners to begin.

- Circulate and monitor, referencing the following resources as necessary:

- **Collaborative Literary Argument Evidence note-catcher (example for teacher reference)**

- **Collaborative Literary Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer (example for teacher reference)**

- **Collaborative Literary Argument Writing: Annotated (for teacher reference)**

- With two minutes remaining, refocus students and allow time for them to log off devices or put away materials.

- Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target, using a checking for understanding technique. Scan student responses, and make a note of students who might need support. Check in with them moving forward.

Closing and Assessment

A. Debrief Collaborative Writing Process – SL.6.1b (5 minutes)

- Separate writing partners and create new partnerships for this activity.

- Explain that working with a partner to accomplish a task has its benefits and its drawbacks. Reflecting on the process can help students strategize to determine best practices for working effectively and productively. Remind students that reflections, like any partner sharing, should be kind, helpful, and specific.

- Invite students to discuss the following three questions with their new partner:

“What is going well so far in the collaborative process?”

“What could be improved about the collaborative process?”

“What specific actions will I take to make these improvements?”

- Circulate and monitor, listening to see if there are any major issues that need to be addressed. Be sure, also, to celebrate the highlights of working with a partner. As needed, cue students to listen carefully to one another:

“Can you repeat what your partner said in your own words?”

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
