<li><p>The campaign might be dangerous: “‘If this is going to be a campaign, then I have to go it without you. It might be dangerous and I want you safe while I’m gone. It’ll be me and other vets doing this’” (59).</p></li>
<li><p>Pop says that the people in DC are gathering as an army, and Cal is only 12: “‘. . . you can’t go to Washington with me. I’m not saying it’ll be dangerous, but it’ll be an army and you are not ready yet to be part of any army’” (94).</p></li>
<li><p>There will be many veterans participating in the campaign.</p></li>

<td><p><strong>Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>Cal is mature and smart. Washington, DC may be dangerous for some children, but Cal is not like other children. He has already shown that he can adapt well to challenging situations.</p></td>
<td><p><strong>Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>Cal is too young to participate in the events of this important campaign. The campaign includes thousands of adult veterans. Even if Cal is a smart kid, he doesn’t know anything about the war. The dangers of a campaign in Washington are different from the dangers of the road.</p></td>

<li><p>Pop reassures Cal that he will return to get him as soon as the campaign is over: “‘Anyhow, Cal, it won’t be for that long,’ he says. ‘Just till I am done in DC and I can come back and get you’” (95).</p></li>
<li><p>Cal will miss Pop, but it’s okay for them to be apart: “<em>A man can stand almost anything as long as it’s not forever</em>. That’s what I tell myself. I have to come to terms with this. It’ll be over before all that long. Just a few months. Pop will get his bonus money, come back and get me. I’ll grow my hair back then. We’ll start a whole new life on a new piece of land” (121).</p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>Cal and Pop are a good team. They can understand each other without even speaking. They trust each other. Even if Washington is dangerous, Cal will always listen to Pop and do as he says in order to avoid danger. Pop might be fine in DC by himself without Cal, but even Pop agrees that things are easier with a little help. Pop is older, and he could probably use Cal’s quick thinking and acting.</p></td>
<td><p><strong>Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>Even if Cal doesn’t like Challagi, he will only be there temporarily. Pop will come back for him as soon as the campaign in Washington is over. Even Cal realizes that “a man can stand almost anything as long as it’s not forever.”</p></td>

<td><p><strong>Evidence</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The campaign is important. It could lead to great things for veterans, especially for Cal and Pop, specifically: “‘Think of that, Cal, thousands of men camping out in the very heart of the nation. Asking the nation to open its heart to those of us who fought for freedom’”; “‘And if we do get our bonuses . . . then I’ll have enough money for us to get a little place of our own and a good life. A federal mortgage, vocational training. All that could happen. I could get us a house, really settle in again’” (92–93).</p></li>
<li><p>Worrying about Cal will be distracting for Pop: “I want to know you’ll be safe with three hots and a cot” (94).</p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>Pop wants Cal to go to Challagi because he says it’s safer than being in DC. However, Challagi might not be a very safe environment. Pop describes some brutal discipline and even he ran away from Challagi when he was a student. Also, Challagi is a school where every student is an American Indian, but this is a part of Cal’s identity that is very new to him. He might feel threatened or out of place there.</p></td>
<td><p><strong>Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>This is an important time for Pop and Cal. If the veteran campaign goes well, they could have a really good life. Pop has a plan and he wants what is best for him and Cal and for the other veterans. It’s important that Cal is not around for him to worry about, so that Pop can focus on the campaign.</p></td>

<p>Cal has always been a smart kid, but he has not had a chance to be in school since his mother passed away. Pop wants Cal to go back to school and get the formal education that he has missed. Challagi is a place where Cal can do that.</p></td>

<ul>
<li><p>Cal will have guaranteed food and shelter at Challagi: “‘I cannot think of any place other than old Plains View that would give you not just an education but also food every day and a roof over your head’” (94).</p></li>
<li><p>Challagi is safer for Cal than Washington would be: “‘Even boarding school’s better for Indians than DC.’” (110).</p></li>
<li><p>Pop made really good friends at Challagi when he was there: “‘Those boys in our Creek gang were some of the best buddies I ever had’” (107).</p></li>
</ul></td>

<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Reasoning</strong></td>
<td><p><strong>Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>Challagi’s not perfect, but it is the best option for Cal at this time. If Cal goes to Challagi, Pop can rest knowing that Cal has access to food and shelter. Also, Cal doesn’t have any friends or other family; he only has Pop. Going to Challagi might be good for Cal because he’ll have a chance to connect with other people his own age.</p></td>

<td><p><strong>Reasoning</strong></p>
<p>It is difficult for Pop think about what happened during the war. When he goes to Washington, he will be with other veterans who may feel the same way. Pop might want space from his son during this time.</p></td>

Now that I’ve thought about it, my claim is **Pop should not bring Cal to Washington, DC with him**.
