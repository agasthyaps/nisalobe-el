**Directions:** As you enter class, read the learning targets. Next, reread the introduction of the Model Literary Argument Essay. Then read the paragraph below. In the table on the next page, document specific notices and wonderings regarding the differences between the two paragraphs.

After hanging out with his son for a few years, camping out and hopping trains to get places, Cal’s dad says that he wants to go to Washington, DC. I read a book by Joseph Bruchac titled *Two Roads*, and in this book, Pop fought in World War I and now he needs money. The guy needs money because it’s the Great Depression and he lost his home. Pop wants to go to DC to ask the government for the money he’s owed for fighting in World War I. Pop and Cal are like besties, if you’re okay with your dad being your bestie, lol, but Pop warns Cal that Cal is “not ready yet to be part of any army” like the one gathering in Washington (94). What that means is Cal can’t go with Pop. Cal has to go to some school he’s never heard of called Challagi Indian Industrial School. Pop tells Cal that at school Cal can learn some more stuff and make good friends. Cal is totally bummed because Pop is his bff, ya know? Although Cal is nervous and sad, Pop should not bring Cal to Washington with him. What’s going on in Washington isn’t cool for Cal to see, and being at school is a better choice for a guy Cal’s age.
