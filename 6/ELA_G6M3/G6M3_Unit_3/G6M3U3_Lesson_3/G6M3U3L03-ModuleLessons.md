Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.6.1d – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they notice the style differences between the model literary argument essay introduction and an alternative introduction paragraph.

- W.6.1a – Work Time A: Students analyze the introduction of the model essay, noting the purpose and contributions of each section of the introduction.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time B: Students participate in a Language Dive to explore the main claim of the model essay. They use textual evidence to support their analysis of the sentence.

- W.6.1a – Work Time B: During the Language Dive, students analyze the way the main claim is introduced in the model essay. They use a structurally similar sentence frame to develop the main claims of their own collaborative essays.

- RL.6.1 – Work Time C: Students use textual evidence from *Two Roads* to present and support the main claims of their collaborative literary argument essays.

- W.6.1a – Work Time C: Students draft effective introductions of their collaborative literary argument essays. They introduce a main claim and clearly organize two reasons, which will be explained in more detail in the Proof Paragraph lessons.

- W.6.4 – Work Time C: Students produce clear and coherent introductions of their collaborative literary argument essays.

- W.6.5 – Work Time C: With support from their partners, students develop strong introductions for their collaborative literary argument essays.

- W.6.9a – Work Time C: Students use textual evidence to support the main claim presented in the introductions of their collaborative literary argument essays.

- The Meet My Match activity is designed to be a grapple for the students. Students were introduced to a Painted Essay® argument model in Lesson 1. The red, green, yellow and blue index cards correspond to the painted sections of an introduction paragraph of an argument essay. In the lesson, the Painted Essay® template is displayed as a reference for students, but no direct instruction is given to the students based on the Painted Essay®. Consider whether to further scaffold the activity or to allow students to independently make the connection to the Painted Essay®. The examples presented in the Meet My Match Instructions should also provide a strong hint to the students that the activity is tied to the Painted Essay®.

- Each student in the classroom is going to receive an index card or an introduction paragraph chunk. There should be no student left without a manipulative. If the class has an odd number, designate one student to be a monitor for the activity. This monitor will ensure that students are following the habit of character *integrity* during the activity.

- The last part of the activity asks students to gather with other students to create a full paragraph if there is time. There should be no partial paragraphs, so be sure that the number of students in class corresponds with the number of index cards and introduction paragraph chunks created.

- Consider using other manipulatives instead of index cards, such as flags or colored balls. Be sure to use the standard Painted Essay® colors if other manipulatives are used.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Challenge students to write a counterclaim for their main claim. Then have students work with their partners to identify evidence and reasons in their Collaborative Literary Argument Evidence note-catcher or add reasons and evidence of their own in order to respond to the counterclaim. This activity can help students strengthen the argument they have developed on their note-catcher.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, student pairs completed the evidence note-catcher for their collaborative essay. Then, the pairs examined evidence and made a decision about their main claim. Finally, the student pairs completed the writing planner to plan their collaborative essay that argues whether or not Cal should leave school to find Pop. In this lesson, students will collaboratively write an introduction to their argument essay.

Support All Students

- Consider being very deliberate with the introduction chunks given to ELL students. The background information chunk or main claim chunk have more context available that would be easier to understand and match. ▲

- Consider giving more proficient readers and stronger inference makers the Point 1 Chunk and/or Point 2 Chunk. These chunks have less context and may be a bit harder to place in the introduction paragraph. ▲

- Students may need additional support drafting their introductions. Group those students and lead a discussion that will guide them to giving context to the reader about Cal’s conflict regarding his leaving school to find Pop. Consider using the students’ Collaborative Literary Argument Evidence note-catcher to guide the discussion.

- Writing the introduction could take some pairs longer than 15 minutes. Offer more time, if it is available.

- To support ELLs, this lesson invites students to first engage with the introduction of the Model Literary Argument Essay by participating in a Meet My Match activity before reading the introduction aloud together as a class. Much like the Painted Essay® structure, the Meet My Match activity uses color-coding to distinguish elements in an introduction essay, which supports ELLs by offering additional visual information that does require language ability to interpret. This lesson also features a Language Dive that uses the main claim sentence from the Model Literary Argument Essay. By equipping students with a Practice frame that can be directly incorporated in their own collaborative and independent literary argument essay, this Dive prepares students to produce effective introduction paragraphs that state a clear argument. This direct applicability is key for ELLs, who may have less formulaic language to draw from in their own academic writing.

- ELLs may find it challenging to participate in the Meet My Match activity, as this is an unfamiliar activity and one that requires a deep understanding of the model essay’s introduction paragraph and its parts. Take time to clarify expectations and field student questions. Invite students to reiterate the task directions aloud to a classmate in order to demonstrate understanding.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.4, 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.7, 6.I.C.10, 6.I.C.11, 6.I.C.12, 6.II.A.1, 6.II.A.2, 6.II.B.5, 6.II.C.6, and 6.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- Collect the introduction paragraphs of the collaborative essays. Review the introductions for the required criteria on the Argument Writing checklist. Plan to touch base with student pairs that need more support meeting the criteria.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will draft the first Proof Paragraph of their collaborative essays.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.6.1d (5 minutes)

- Distribute the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 3**. Students will also need their **Model Literary Argument Essay**. Follow the same routine as previous lessons to review Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 3. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 3 (example for teacher reference)** for possible responses.

- Explain to students that academic essays are written in a formal style. A writer must keep in mind their audience while writing. Argument essays usually require a formal style of writing because this style establishes the writer as someone knowledgeable who has carefully thought through the issue.

- Turn and Talk:

“What makes the style of the model literary argument essay introduction more formal than the alternative introduction paragraph that is provided on the entrance ticket?” (The model essay uses more sophisticated and academic vocabulary. The model essay also does not talk to the audience as if the reader is a friend of the writer.)

“What effect does changing the formality of one’s writing style have on the reader’s experience of a text?” (More formal language communicates a more serious tone; it usually sounds more academic. It provides the impression that the writer has done careful thinking and knows what they are talking about.)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar to or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Analyze Model Introduction – W.6.1a (10 minutes)

- Divide the class in half. Distribute the **red, green, yellow, and blue index cards** to one half of the class. Give each student only one colored index card. Remind students that these are the colors used to indicate the key components in the Painted Essay® structure.

- Distribute the **Model Literary Argument Essay: Introduction Chunks** to the other half of the class. Give each student only one chunk of the introduction paragraph.

- Explain that students are about to participate in an activity that focuses on more deeply understanding the introduction of an argument essay.

- Explain or display the **Meet My Match Instructions**. Answer clarifying questions.

- Direct student attention to the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Ask:

“What would it look like to behave with integrity during this activity?” (Only asking yes or no questions. Only responding by saying *yes* or *no*.)

- Invite students to begin the activity. Refer to the **Model Literary Argument Essay: Painted (example for teacher reference)** for correct matches.

- After 4 minutes have passed, instruct students to remain standing with their partner.

- Display the **Model Literary Argument Essay: Painted**. Be sure to only show the introduction paragraph.

- Read the first paragraph, stopping at “ . . . and make friends.”

- Turn and Talk:

“This red section of the introduction paragraph contains background information. Why is background information important to an argument essay?” (The background information is the context the reader needs to know in order to understand the foundation of the argument.)

- Think-Pair-Share:

“In your own words, explain the context provided in the introduction paragraph.” (Pop needs to go to Washington DC and fight for the bonus money he has earned. Pop thinks that Cal should go to school while he is away.)

- Focus students on the next sentence: “Although Cal feels nervous and sad that he cannot go with his father, Pop should not bring Cal to Washington with him.” Turn and Talk:

“This green section of the introduction paragraph is the main claim. Why is the main claim important to an argument essay?” (The main claim provides the main idea that the writer wants the reader to take away. The main claim expresses the writer’s position in the argument.)

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What is the writer’s position in the argument?” (Pop should not bring Cal to Washington DC.)

- Focus students on the final sentence of the introduction: “The events in Washington are not appropriate for Cal to attend, and spending some time at Challagi is a better alternative for him.”

- Turn and Talk:

“The yellow and blue sections of the introduction paragraph preview point 1 and point 2. Why are these points important to an argument essay?” (Point 1 and Point 2 are reasons that support the claim. Reasons are important because they help the writer prove their position in the argument.)

- Think-Pair-Share:

“How do Point 1 and Point 2 support the main claim?” (Point 1 and Point 2 give reasons why Pop should not bring Cal to Washington DC with him.)

- Direct students to return to their seats.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

B. Language Dive: Model Essay Claim – W.6.1a (10 minutes)

- Tell students they will now participate in a 10-minute Language Dive to examine an effective main claim of a literary argument essay.

- Direct students to retrieve their **Model Literary Argument Essay**.

- Focus students on the claim:

- “Although Cal feels nervous and sad that he cannot go with his father, Pop should not bring Cal to Washington with him.”

- Use the **Language Dive Guide: Model Essay Claim** and the **Language Dive: Model Essay Claim Sentence Chunk Chart** to guide students through a Language Dive conversation about the sentence. Distribute and display the **Language Dive: Model Essay Claim note-catcher**, the **Language Dive: Model Essay Claim sentence chunk strips**, and the **Questions We Can Ask During a Language Dive anchor chart**. Refer to the **Language Dive: Model Essay Claim note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- As an extension to the Language Dive of Work Time B and to reinforce work with W.6.1a, challenge students who need lighter support to rewrite the main claim so that it follows the same structure, but represents the opposite opinion (i.e., that Pop *should* bring Cal to Washington with him). Point out that students will also need to incorporate different counterclaims in the subordinate clause that begins with *Although* (e.g., Although the veterans’ campaign may be dangerous for children, Pop should bring Cal to Washington with him).

For Heavier Support

- As an extension to the Language Dive of Work Time B, invite students who need heavier support to revisit past Language Dives and draw connections among past learning and current work. In the Language Dive of this lesson, students encounter the word *Although* in the focus structure. A phrase with a meaning very similar to *although* — *even though* —was explored in detail during the Mini Language Dive of Module 2, Unit 1, Lesson 3. In that Mini Language Dive, students learned that the phrase *even though* can be used to introduce ideas that might be surprising; the word *Although* functions similarly in the current Language Dive sentence. Invite students to think of other phrases that can be used for similar purposes or practice using these phrases in their own original sentences.

Work Time

C. Collaborative Writing: Draft an Introduction – W.6.1a (15 minutes)

- Invite students to retrieve their **Collaborative Literary Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer** and their copy of the **Argument Writing checklist**. Point out the following characteristics on the checklist:

“W.6.1a: I have an introduction that gives readers the context they need to understand the topic or text.”

“W.6.1d: I use a formal style.”

- Turn and Talk:

“Look at the second column. Are there any specific criteria you should be aware of specifically for this collaborative essay?” (The introduction provides context about Cal and the details of his conflict. I remove slang and conversational language to sound more serious and thoughtful.)

- As students share out, capture their responses in the Characteristics of this Argument Writing column and direct them to do the same on their own copy. Refer to the **Argument Writing checklist (example for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Explain that students will work with their writing partner to draft their introduction to the argument essay focused on Cal’s decision to leave school to find Pop. Students should base their draft on the information they gathered and organized on their **Collaborative Literary Argument Evidence note-catcher** and Collaborative Literary Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer.

- Distribute **lined paper** or **devices**, and invite writing partners to begin.

- Circulate and monitor, referencing the following resources as necessary:

- **Collaborative Literary Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer (example for teacher reference)**

- **Collaborative Literary Argument Evidence note-catcher (example for teacher reference)**

- **Collaborative Literary Argument Writing: Annotated (example for teacher reference)**

- With 2 minutes remaining, refocus students and allow time for them to log off devices or put away materials.

- Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target.

Closing and Assessment

A. Peer Review – W.6.1a, W.6.5 (5 minutes)

- Ask students to retrieve their Argument Writing checklist. Group two writing partnerships to make a group of four, and direct partnerships to swap their introduction drafts.

- Distribute **sticky notes** for recording their feedback.

- Focus students on the **Work to Contribute to a Better World anchor chart**, specifically *use my strengths*. Remind students that because they will be working to give a critique to the other partnership, they will need to use their strengths.

- Invite students to provide feedback to the other partners based on the criteria identified from the Argument Writing checklist: W.6.1a: I have an introduction that gives readers the context they need to understand the topic or text. Invite students to provide at least one star (an area that is done well) and one step (an area for improvement).

- Circulate to support students as they work together to give feedback to one another. Emphasize that students should not make revisions yet, just take the feedback into consideration for now.

- Invite students to reflect on their progress towards the relevant learning target.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent research reading journal**.
