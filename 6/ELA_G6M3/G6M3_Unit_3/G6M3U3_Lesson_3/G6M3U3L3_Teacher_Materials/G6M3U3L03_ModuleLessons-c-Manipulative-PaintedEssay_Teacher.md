<th>After years of living on the road with<br />
his son, Cal, camping and hopping trains,<br />
Pop tells Cal that he plans to go to<br />
Washington, DC. In Joseph Bruchac’s<br />
historical fiction novel, <em>Two Roads</em>, Pop is a<br />
war veteran and, like many other veterans<br />
at that time, he is being mistreated by the<br />
government. Pop wants to participate in<br />
a large campaign to help veterans receive<br />
the money that the government owes<br />
them for their service. Pop warns Cal<br />
that the campaign may be dangerous and<br />
that Cal is “not ready yet to be part of any<br />
army” like the one fighting in Washington<br />
(94). Therefore, Cal cannot join him.<br />
Instead, Cal must attend Challagi<br />
Indian Industrial School while Pop is<br />
away. Pop says that this will also be a<br />
good opportunity for Cal to continue his<br />
education and make friends.</th>
