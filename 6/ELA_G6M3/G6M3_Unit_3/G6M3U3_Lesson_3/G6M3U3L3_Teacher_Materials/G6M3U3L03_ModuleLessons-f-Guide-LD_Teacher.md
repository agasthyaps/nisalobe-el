Deconstruct

- Ask:

“What do you notice about this chunk?” (Answers will vary, but may include: this chunk creates a complete sentence; this chunk clearly states the writer’s opinion; this chunk refers to events in Two Roads.)

- **should**

“What does the meaning of the word should tell us about the purpose of this chunk?” (The word should is used to say that something is the best thing to do. That tells us that this chunk is meant to state an argument.)

“This chunk is a complete sentence. However, there is another chunk in our Language Dive. What kind of information might another chunk add?” (Answers will vary, but may include: another chunk might give an explanation or provide additional context.)

Although Cal feels nervous and sad that

Deconstruct: Focus Structure

- **Cal feels nervous and sad that he cannot go with his father,**

“Does this section of the chunk, without although, form a complete sentence? How do you know?” (Yes; it contains a subject \[Cal\] and a verb \[feels\] and it tells a complete thought.)

“What happens to the completeness of the chunk when we add although?” (It becomes incomplete; it becomes a dependent clause that requires another independent clause.)

“Why does it make Cal feel nervous and sad that he cannot go with his father?” (He feels nervous because he has never been away from his father before and doesn’t know what to expect from Challagi Indian Industrial School. He feels sad because he loves being on the road with Pop and will miss him.)

- **Although**

“What does the word although tell us about this chunk?” (It tells us that there is some kind of contrast or contradiction, or that a piece of information might be surprising or unexpected.)

“How does the word although prepare us for the argument that Pop should not bring Cal to Washington with him?” (Although signals that there is some kind of contradiction or surprising element in the sentence. When we see although, we know that the writer is going to present two contrasting statements that are both true at the same time \[Cal feels nervous and sad about being left behind; Pop should not take Cal with him\].)

- **Students can use Conversation Cues as they discuss. To provide heavier support, display a suggested sequence, such as the one below:**

- Goal 1. Let’s take time to think and write or sketch.

- Goal 2. Who can tell us what your classmate said in your own words?

- Goal 4. Who can add on to what your classmate said?

- Goal 3. How does our discussion add to your understanding of making claims in an argument essay?

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Students can complete the frame to describe something they feel nervous about, and what they are doing or feeling in spite of those nerves.

Although I feel nervous that \_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_.  Step 3

- To provide lighter support: “Can you exchange the adjective **nervous** for other adjectives and create other sentences?”

- To provide heavier support: Provide options for students to select from when filling in the first blank (e.g., the mid-unit assessment; writing a paper; my volleyball game this weekend.)

Although Cal feels nervous and sad that  
he cannot go with his father, Pop should  
not bring Cal to Washington with him.

Reconstruct

- Students can examine the sentence that follows this one in the model essay: The events in Washington are not appropriate for Cal to attend, and spending some time at Challagi is a better alternative for him.

“What is the relationship between our Language Dive sentence and the sentence that follows it?” (Our Language Dive sentence states a main claim, and the sentence that follows it gives two reasons that support the claim.)

“What will come in the next paragraphs of the model essay?” (Two Proof Paragraphs that describe these reasons in more detail.)

“What if the model essay did not include our Language Dive sentence? How would that weaken the essay overall?” (If the model essay did not include our Language Dive sentence, it would not have a main claim. It would weaken the essay by making it less clear what the overall purpose of the argument was.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Answers will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the daily learning target, I can determine the characteristics of an effective main claim by analyzing the model?” (Answers will vary.)

Practice (Sentence)

- Students can reflect on the question they aim to answer in their collaborative literary argument essays: Should Cal leave Challagi Indian Industrial School to find Pop?

“Although \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, Cal should \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.”  Step 4

- To provide lighter support: “Can you think of other similar words or phrases to use instead of **although**?”

- To provide heavier support: Invite students to discuss the meaning of the sentence in home language groups.
