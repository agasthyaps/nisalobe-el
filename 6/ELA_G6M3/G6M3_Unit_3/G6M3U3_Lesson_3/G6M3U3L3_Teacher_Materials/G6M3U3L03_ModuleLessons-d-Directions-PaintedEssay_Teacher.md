Meet My Match Instructions

Each student in the classroom receives either an index card or an introduction paragraph chunk. There should be no student left without a manipulative. If the class has an odd number, one student will be designated as a monitor for the activity. This monitor will ensure that students are following the habit of character **integrity** during the activity.

- Each of the four index card colors corresponds with an introduction paragraph chunk, according to the Painted Essay® structure. Students should mingle around the room, trying to find their match. Explain that students may <u>not</u> share their written introduction chunk with a partner until both students are sure that their cards are a match. Instead, students will ask each other questions in order to find their appropriate match.

- Students are only allowed to ask each other *yes* or *no* questions in order to secure their match.

- Example: Does your essay chunk provide the writer’s position in the argument?

- Example: Does your card color represent a reason that supports the main claim?

- Students are only allowed to respond to each question with a *yes* or *no* answer

- When students are confident that they’ve met their match, they should read the introduction chunk together and engage in a discussion exploring whether their match is correct.

- If time permits, encourage students to find other student pairs that present the remaining sections of the introduction paragraph. The group of eight students standing together should contain index cards of all four colors and be able to read the independent paragraph chunks in order to express a complete introduction paragraph.

- At the end of the activity, display the Painted Essay® version of the model introduction paragraph.
