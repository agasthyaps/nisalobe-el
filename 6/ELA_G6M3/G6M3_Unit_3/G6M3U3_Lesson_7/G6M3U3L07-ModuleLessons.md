Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RL.6.1 – Work Time A: Students review, gather, and evaluate textual evidence on their independent Literary Argument Evidence note-catchers. They will use this evidence to support the main claim of their independent literary argument essays.

- W.6.1b – Work Time A: Students locate additional relevant evidence to support the reasons and claims of their essays.

- W.6.9a – Work Time A: Students use additional textual evidence to support the claims and reasons that they present in their essays.

- W.6.1a – Work Time B: Students plan their independent literary argument essays using their Literary Argument Writing Plan graphic organizers. They plan an introduction that introduces the main claim and organizes the reasons and evidence clearly.

- W.6.1b – Work Time B: On their planners, students support their main claim with clear reasons and relevant evidence.

- W.6.1e – Work Time B: Students plan a conclusion paragraph that follows from the argument presented.

- W.6.4 – Work Time B: Students consider task, purpose, and audience as they plan the content of their essays.

- W.6.5 – Work Time B: With support, students plan their independent literary argument essays.

- W.6.9a – Work Time B: Students incorporate textual evidence into their planners to support the reasons and claims that they present in their essays.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Identify students in class who are particularly good at different aspects of the writing process; allow them to conference with their classmates to give advice on their area of expertise.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Students have been analyzing a model and using their analysis to draft a collaborative literary argument essay. In this lesson, students will use what they learned during the collaborative writing process to independently complete their evidence gathering and then plan their literary argument essay.

Support All Students

- Note that there is a differentiated version of the Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 7 used in Opening A in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Some students may feel nervous by the idea of writing a literary argument essay on their own. Point out the similarities between the content of this essay and that of the narrative they wrote in Unit 2. Help students recognize that much of their thinking about the essay topic has already taken place. Encourage them to shift their mental energy to differences in structure, purpose, and audience between the two types of writing tasks.

- Remind students that the more they plan their essays now, the easier the Literary Argument Essay task will be. It may be helpful for some students to have an opportunity to interact and discuss their ideas aloud before beginning to plan independently.

- To support ELLs, this lesson gives students time and guidance to plan the literary argument essays that they will write during the mid-unit assessment of the following lesson. Students revisit text evidence collected in a previous unit and add new findings. They then use the Independent Literary Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer to plan the paragraphs of their argument essays, with careful attention to context, reasons, evidence, and reasoning. Students worked with an identical planner when writing their collaborative essays in previous lessons. The planner is straightforward and familiar, thus clarifying expectations and reducing cognitive overload for ELLs.

- ELLs may find it challenging to independently plan their essays, especially if they relied heavily on the support of their partners during the collaborative essays. Work with students to develop a timeline that can keep them moving through their planners at an appropriate pace. Encourage students to think about which sections of the collaborative essay were the most challenging or time-consuming for them and encourage them to allocate the most time to these sections.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.4, 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.7, 6.I.C.10, 6.I.C.11, 6.I.C.12, 6.II.A.1, 6.II.A.2, 6.II.B.5, 6.II.C.6, and 6.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- Consider using the Grade 6 Writing Process checklist to assess students’ writing abilities in Work Time A (see the Tools Page: http://eled.org/tools).

- Meet with each student during the planning time for a one-minute conference to check for understanding.

Down the Road

- In the next two lessons, students will complete the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment for which they independently draft their literary argument essays based on their evidence gathering and planning.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Determine strategic groupings for the peer critique in Closing and Assessment A. As students will have likely developed a rapport from working with their writing partners during the first half of this unit, consider reuniting collaborative writing partners for this activity.

- Review the student tasks and example answers to get familiar with what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Prepare copies of handouts for students, including entrance ticket (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time A: Students who struggle to remain focused may benefit from breaking up the planning time into smaller chunks. Use an online timer set to smaller increments, perhaps 5 minutes, and give students one discrete task to focus on during that 5-minute interval (e.g., filling in just the Introduction section of the Writing Plan graphic organizer).

- Work Time A: Students may prefer to type their responses for the Literary Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer. Provide devices with word-processing software, if available.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Direct students to retrieve their **Independent Argument Evidence note-catcher** that was started in Unit 2, Lesson 11.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What is one update that you should make to your note-catcher based on your growing understanding of what makes an effective literary argument?” (Responses will vary.)

- Using a preferred classroom routine, collect or review the answers to **Homework: Strengthen Claim, Evidence, and Reasoning**. Refer to **Homework: Strengthen Claim, Evidence, and Reasoning (answers for teacher reference)**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as with the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar to or the same as in previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Gather and Evaluate Evidence – RL.6.3, W.6.1 (10 minutes)

- Direct students to review the reasons and evidence they gave for both positions regarding the prompt: Should Cal return to Challagi Indian Industrial School? Explain that, in the next lesson, students will be using this thinking to independently write an argument essay for their mid-unit assessment. They will now have time to review and update their Independent Argument Evidence note-catcher with stronger or more fully developed evidence and reasoning.

- Students may also want to refer to their ***Two Roads*** text, **Analyze Character: *Two Roads*** **note-catcher** and **Analyze Point of View: *Two Roads*** **note-catcher**.

- As students work, circulate to push their thinking, provide support, and answer questions as needed. Refer to **Independent Argument Evidence note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** for guidance.

- Direct students to complete the final part of the note catcher blank (“Now that I’ve thought about it, my claim is \_\_\_\_\_”).

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time A, encourage students who need lighter support to revisit and polish the sentences they produced during the Practice sections of the Language Dives and Mini Language Dives of Lessons 3, 4, 5, and 6. Allow students to incorporate these sentences into their planners for use in the problem-solution essays that they write during the mid-unit assessment of the following lessons.

For Heavier Support

N/A

Work Time

B. Plan Literary Argument Essay – W.6.1, W.6.5 (25 minutes)

- Explain that now students will use their completed evidence note catcher to plan their argument essay to support their chosen claim.

- Distribute the **Independent Literary Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer** and display the **Characteristics of Effective Argument Writing anchor chart**.

- Remind students that they may refer to the following materials as necessary:

- Independent Argument Evidence note-catcher

- **Collaborative Literary Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer**

- **Collaborative Literary Argument Essay**

- **Model Literary Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer**

- **Model Literary Argument Essay**

- **Argument Writing checklist**

- Circulate to support students as they plan. If necessary, prompt by asking questions such as:

“What evidence do you have for this point?”

“How does that evidence support your point?”

“How does that point support your claim?”

“How might you acknowledge the other side of the issue, the other claim?”

- Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target, using a checking for understanding technique. Scan student responses and make a note of students who might need support. Check in with them moving forward.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time B, as students plan their essays, consider providing sentence strips that feature the structural frames that students completed during the Language Dives and Mini Language Dives of Lessons 3, 4, 5, and 6. Encourage them to use these sentences as “checkpoints” around which the remainder of their essay can be built. Some frames may require minor modifications so that they are ready for use in this essay. For example:

- Although \_\_\_\_\_\_, Cal should \_\_\_\_\_\_.

- The first reason why Cal should \_\_\_\_\_\_ is that \_\_\_\_\_\_.

- Even though \_\_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_\_ “\_\_\_\_\_\_” (\_\_\_).

- The best way for Cal to \_\_\_\_\_\_ is to \_\_\_\_\_\_.

Closing and Assessment

A. Whole Group Reflection (5 minutes)

- Invite students to share their thoughts about their planning from today. Clarify that, in the next two lessons, they will write their literary argument essay. Review and troubleshoot any areas of uncertainty in preparation for assessment in the next lesson.

- If desired, ask students to share the position they’ll be taking in their essay, whether Cal should return to Challagi or whether Cal should stay in Washington with Pop.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.
