Listen to the model recording a second time and then reflect on the content by responding to the items below.

**Introduction and Reading Sections**

- What is the context?

This is written by a student at Carlisle Indian School. He was forced to go there when he was 11.

- Who is the writer of the excerpt?

Luther Standing Bear, part of the Lakota tribe.

- What are the key ideas in the excerpt?

Standing Bear had to have his name changed into English. He just chose one from a list. It was cruel to force people to change the students or not let them speak Indian languages. History and language should never be destroyed.

**Reflection Section**

- What perspective or point of view toward the experience of the boarding schools is being conveyed in the excerpt? What words or phrases from the excerpt helped me determine that point of view?

The point of view being conveyed is that the experience of the boarding schools was negative because it took away people’s identities. By forcing students to change their names, the students lost something of who they are.

- Why is the excerpt meaningful?

This excerpt is meaningful because it shows the importance of naming. People want to be called by the names that they identify with.

- What can we learn from the excerpt?

We can learn that it is important to use people’s names correctly as a way to show respect.

- How does this perspective compare and contrast with the perspective of my own excerpt? Of the module texts?

Answers will vary, but may include: The Marianna Burgess Embe text that I chose describes a girl who forgot much of her Indian language after attending Carlisle Indian School. This is similar to the perspective of the model text because both show the importance of language and identity. It’s different because the model text focuses on names in particular, whereas the Embe text talks about language overall.
