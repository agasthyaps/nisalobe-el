Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.6.1 – Work Time A: Students analyze a model performance task recording, using evidence from the recording to support their analysis of the recording’s content.

- RI.6.6 – Work Time A: While analyzing the model performance task recording, students determine the speaker’s purpose in including a preface and reflection.

- SL.6.2 – Work Time A: Students listen to a model recording, reviewing and demonstrating understanding of its key ideas.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- To reinforce W.6.7 work, consider inviting students who need lighter support to conduct research to select their own texts during Work Time B. Either independently or in groups, students can visit the school or local library or explore online databases of texts written by boarding school attendees. Guide and monitor students’ research as needed to ensure that students are accessing texts that are appropriate in terms of reading level and content.

- The performance task, a Voices of American Indian Boarding Schools Audio Museum event, is built upon the idea that stories are powerful––and for their writers and tellers, empowering–when shared with a larger audience. To further understand the power of stories, consider selecting and sharing other recorded stories with students. Students can reflect on their overall impact and/or evaluate them for their pace, intonation, and volume in preparation for the end of unit assessment. Collections of powerful stories can be accessed for free online at websites such as http://eled.org/0222 or http://eled.org/0223; note, however, that the target audience for these collections is adults, so stories should be screened carefully to ensure that they are age-appropriate.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In this lesson, students select primary source texts to read and record as part of the end of unit assessment and performance task. In Unit 1, students read other primary source texts (e.g., those by Zitkala-Sa) that highlighted the experiences of students in American Indian boarding schools. These readings in earlier units, in addition to the anchor text, *Two Roads*, helped students widen their understanding of the module topic and acquainted them with the diversity of the experiences and “voices” of American Indian boarding school survivors. The work students do for the end of unit assessment and performance task continues that practice.

Support All Students

- During Work Time A, students analyze a model performance task recording, noting and evaluating the speaker’s volume, pronunciation, and language use. The topic of pronunciation may be especially sensitive for ELLs. Be mindful in the way pronunciation issues are framed and described in class. Remind all students that *everyone* has an accent; the way our speech sounds depends on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the region we live in, the family we have, the first language we speak, our own individual vocal cords. In preparing students to make their own recordings, it is critical to avoid harmfully alienating students by requiring that they speak with a pronunciation that is unnatural or unrealistic for them. If students struggle to make themselves understood, offer support not with individual speech sounds, but with other issues that affect intelligibility, such as pace, intonation (the rising and falling of our speech), and word and sentence stress. This emphasis will set students up for success: speakers can learn and adjust their pace and stress and intonation patterns more easily than they can change the way their mouths produce specific sounds.

- Consider alternative ways to present the performance task texts students can select during Work Time B. It may be most effective to cut up the texts from the Performance Task: Text List and display them around the classroom for students to read and select. As another option, consider strategically pairing students according to reading ability or home languages and giving them their own text lists to peruse. ▲ If there is a concern that students will argue over their selections, consider cutting up the texts and giving each student one or two texts, which they can read and trade with partners until they locate one that they like.

- Set a purpose and plan for sifting through the many readings by asking students what about the American Indian boarding school experience they most want to convey to the audience. Prompt students to look for that particular element as they are reading and selecting a text to share.

- Because the texts for the recording describe experiences of students who attended American Indian boarding schools, some of the content may be upsetting for students to read aloud. Encourage students to continue examining available texts until they find something that they are moved by and also feel comfortable reading aloud.

- Leverage local resources by reaching out to a nearby historical society or, if available, Indian reservation to provide information about Native Americans who lived in the area. For maximum impact, arrange for a guest contributor from such an organization to record their own contribution to the audio museum.

- To support ELLs, this lesson prepares students for the performance task of Lesson 13. First, an entrance ticket invites students to paraphrase the instructions for the performance task, giving ELLs a chance to self-assess their own understanding of the task and allowing an opportunity for teacher intervention, as needed. Then, students carefully analyze a model performance task recording, familiarizing themselves with the Performance Task Recording Planner and with the expectations for the recording.

- ELLs may find it challenging to select an appropriate text from the Performance Task Recording: Text List. Available texts vary in terms of language complexity, and it may be challenging for some ELLs to quickly gauge whether a text is at their level. Consider screening the texts ahead of time and providing students a shorter list to select from or annotating the pieces with brief descriptions. This may help students select appropriate texts more quickly.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.4, 6.I.B.5, 6.I.B.7, 6.I.B.8, and 6.I.B.12.

Assessment Guidance

- In this lesson, students select texts, which they will record themselves reading aloud during the End of Unit 3 Assessment of Lesson 12. Students may be confused about the relationship between the end of unit assessment and the performance task of Lesson 13—students will develop and refine their recordings as part of the end of unit assessment, and then those same recordings will be featured in the Voices of American Indian Boarding Schools Audio Museum.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue to prepare for the performance task. They will participate in a Language Dive to examine a key sentence from the preface of the model recording. Then, they will write their own preface and reflection, which will frame their reading. In Lesson 12, as part of the end of unit assessment, students will record themselves reading aloud their preface, their selected text, and their reflection. These recordings will be featured during the audio museum performance task of Lesson 13.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Determine the way in which the model recording will be shared with students during Work Time A. Access the model recording via http://eled.org/6m3-modelperformancetask. Speakers or another external audio system can be used to project the model recording to the whole class. If adjustments to the model are desired or necessary, consider re-recording the model in your own voice and sharing this with students. This may also serve as a way to screen available technological options before determining what is best for students to use when developing their own recordings.

- Create a sign-up sheet, or some other recording form, to keep track of the texts students have selected during Work Time B. Some students may want to choose the same text; determine whether it is preferred for students to each have different texts or if it is OK that they repeat.

- Due to time constraints, students should be encouraged to make their text selection during Work Time B. Provide computers or tablets for students to move on to the next step—gathering some brief biographical details about the author of their selected text to include in the Preface: Background and Context section of the Performance Task Recording Planner. Consider gathering this information in advance and giving it to students in bulleted format for them to write in their own words.

- Review the student tasks and example answers to get familiar with what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Prepare copies of handouts for students, including entrance ticket (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time A: The model recording may be accessed via http://eled.org/6m3-modelperformancetask.

- Work Time B: Set up computers or tablets with access to the internet for students who are ready to begin gathering brief biographical context for their chosen performance task reading.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 10**. Students will also need the **Audio Museum: Performance Task directions** and the **Performance Task Recording Planner** in order to complete the entrance ticket. Display the **Performance Task anchor chart** for reference as well.

- Invite students to share their paraphrasing of the performance task directions. Clarify any misconceptions or confusion. Remind students they have already used the recording application at the end of Unit 2 when they practiced recording their letters to Possum.

- Request that students update the steps they wrote for their entrance ticket based on the clarifications provided, and then display these in a prominent location for students to reference as they move forward.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar to or the same as previous lessons. Invite students to choose a habit of character focus for themselves for this lesson.

Work Time

A. Analyze a Model Recording – SL.6.2 (20 minutes)

- Focus students on the Performance Task Recording Planner.

- Draw student attention to the Preface: Background and Context section of the planner. Using a total participation technique, ask:

“What elements should be included in the prefaces we write?” (The prefaces we write should include: the name of the person who wrote the piece we selected, biographical information about that writer, some information about the American Indian boarding school that the writer attended, and general contextual information about the reading.)

“Based on the planner, what would you say is the purpose of the preface in this recording? Why is it important that we include a preface to our texts in our recordings?” (The purpose of the preface is to prepare the listener for what they are about to hear. Our texts will make more sense and be more impactful if the listener knows who wrote them, in what context, and under what conditions.)

- Draw student attention to the Reflection section of the planner. Using a total participation technique, ask:

“What elements should be included in the reflections we write?” (We should include why the piece is meaningful to me, why it’s important to share, what I learned about how to treat others from this piece, and what I took away and can apply to my life now.)

“What would you say is the purpose of the reflection in this recording? Why is it important that we include a reflection of our texts in our recordings?” (The purpose of the reflection is to explain why our text is an important one. Our recordings will be more impactful if the listener understands what they mean to us.)

- Tell students that they will now analyze a **Model Recording**, which has the same structure and format as the one they will create as part of their performance task.

- Distribute and display the **Analyze Model Performance Task Recording note-catcher**. Explain that as in Unit 1 when they listened to General Pratt’s speech and one of Zitkala-Sa’s entries, they will listen twice. The first time, they should listen for characteristics of effective presentation skills, checking off the characteristics at the top of the Analyze Model Recording note-catcher as they hear them. Then they will listen again and reflect on the content of the recording.

- Instruct students to form pairs. Play the model recording the first time. Allow students to discuss with their partner where they heard each of the characteristics of effective presentation and check these off on their note-catcher.

- Play the model recording a second time as pairs complete the reflection portion of the note-catcher. Allow them some time after the recording ends to complete their reflections.

- Reconvene the whole class and ask:

“What do you notice about the speaker’s presentation skills? (The pace was slow and clear; the volume was loud enough to understand; the pronunciation was clear enough to be understood; the language was appropriate to the task.)

- Invite students to share their responses to the reflection section of the note-catcher. Refer to the **Analyze Model Performance Task Recording note-catcher (example for teacher reference).**

- Distribute the **Model Performance Task Recording Planner**. Ask pairs to review the planner and add to or revise their responses on the reflection section of the Analyze Model Recording note-catcher.

- Turn and Talk:

“What changes did you make to your note-catcher after reading the presentation on the planner? How did hearing and reading the presentation help build your understanding of the information?” (Answers will vary, but may include: I added more biographical information about the writer.)

“How does what you heard in the recording compare to what you see in the model planner?” (The wording in the recording is the same as in the planner.)

- Tell students that, in the following lesson, they will use this planner to plan their own recordings.

Work Time

B. Select a Text – RL.6.10, RI.6.10 (15 minutes)

- Tell students that they will now select the texts to use for their performance task recording.

- Ask students to retrieve the **Performance Task Recording: Text List**. Students should have at least read through the different text options. Some students may have already chosen which text they want to focus on for the performance task. Explain that some students may end up choosing the same text.

- Remind students that they should be choosing their texts carefully and thoughtfully. If there is not sufficient class time for them to make a selection that they feel good about, they can continue to review and select their texts as homework. If students select their texts before the end of Work Time B, invite them to begin gathering some brief biographical details about the author by conducting research on a **computer or tablet**. Draw students’ attention back to the Model Performance Task Recording Planner for examples of the type of context they should be providing.

For Lighter Support

- During the model performance task recording analysis of Work Time B, invite students who need lighter support to explore the idea of speaking pace. Students, in pairs, can read aloud short passages from the anchor text *Two Roads* to each other as quickly as they can. Then, ask them to read other passages as slowly as possible. Students can reflect with their partners about the effect of pace on intelligibility of their speech.

For Heavier Support

- During the model performance task recording analysis of Work Time B, invite students who need heavier support to explore the idea of speaking pace. If feasible and productive, use a software program to artificially slow down or speed up the speaker’s pace in the model recording. Provide sentence starters for students to describe the impact that each version of the recording has on their listening. For example:

- When the speaker speaks very quickly, I \_\_\_.

- When the speaker speaks very slowly, I \_\_\_.

- When I speak my home language, I usually speak \_\_\_.

- When I speak in English, I usually speak \_\_\_.

- One way to improve my speaking pace in English is to \_\_\_.

Closing and Assessment

A. Peer Share – SL.6.1 (5 minutes)

- Direct students to form triads and share the texts they have selected for the performance task recording. If students worked with partners during Work Time B, they should work with different classmates for this Peer Share. Each student in the triad should plan to address the following three questions during the peer share:

- Which text did you select?

- Why did you choose it?

- What is something that stands out to you right away about the text, its author, or its context?

- Once triads are done sharing their answers to these questions, field any new questions. Clarify that, in the next lesson, students will write a preface and reflection to frame their selected piece for the recording. A Language Dive will help them better understand the purpose and structure of a key sentence in the preface. They will also participate in the final Independent Research Reading share of the module.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from the preface of the model performance task recording. Consider providing ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. To reinforce work with SL.6.4, invite students who need lighter support to record themselves reading aloud the Language Dive sentence. Students can reflect on their recording and note their volume, pace, and pronunciation. Then, they can produce a second recording with small adjustments to their volume, pace, and pronunciation that improve overall intelligibility.

For Heavier Support

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from the model performance task recording. Consider providing ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. To reinforce work with SL.6.4, invite students who need heavier support to record themselves reading aloud the Language Dive sentence. They can also ask a friend, family member, or teacher to read aloud and record the Language Dive sentence as well. Students can reflect on the similarities and differences across the volume, pace, and pronunciation of the two recordings.

Homework

A. Select a Text and Provide Context

- Students continue to review and then select a text for the performance task recording. Students should also begin adding to the Preface: Background and Context section of the Performance Task Recording Planner.
