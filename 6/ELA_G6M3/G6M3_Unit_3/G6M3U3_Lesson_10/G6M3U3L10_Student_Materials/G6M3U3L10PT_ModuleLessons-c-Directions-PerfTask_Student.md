**Name:** **Date:**

Throughout this module, you have been learning about American Indian boarding schools. Despite their legacy and impact, these schools have been neglected in traditional narratives of American history. To honor those who experienced this injustice, you will create an “Audio Museum” exhibit called Voices of American Indian Boarding Schools. This audio museum is meant to amplify the voices of the survivors of the boarding schools.

**What Is an Audio Museum?**

Just what it sounds like: a museum of audio recordings! Usually, when we visit museums, we use our eyes to look at art or dioramas or other visual displays. In the Voices of American Indian Boarding Schools exhibit, we will use our ears.

**Before the Audio Museum**

First, you will select a text (a poem, personal narrative, etc.) written by a survivor of the boarding schools. This text should mean something to you; it should be impactful.

Using the Performance Task Recording Planner, you will write a preface for the text that introduces it and provides necessary context. You will also write a reflection that explains why the text is meaningful.

You will record yourself reading your preface, text, and reflection aloud. You will act as the voice of its author and create space for the author’s words to be shared with a broader audience.

**During the Audio Museum**

Then, we as a class will host the Voices of American Indian Boarding Schools exhibit. Each of you will have a “listening station” where classmates and visitors can listen to your recordings and learn more about the experiences of students at American Indian boarding schools.

You will also listen to the recordings of your classmates during this time. You will answer reflection questions about at least three classmates’ recordings on a note-catcher.

After the audio museum, we will have a discussion as a whole class. We will talk about and reflect on the connections between the performance task and the module overall.

Through our work before and during the audio museum, we can help make sure that these powerful stories about American Indian boarding schools are never forgotten.
