<p><strong>Cal has a premonition that something bad will happen.</strong></p></td>

<li><p><strong>Cal has a history of premonitions, and he trusts them.</strong></p></li>

<td><p>Evidence</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pop told Cal months ago that the campaign would be dangerous.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>The veterans aren’t being treated well: “Some are calling them Reds, saying they should be shot. Some marchers have been beaten and jailed” (263).</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>The group of veterans is “a real army” (267); Pop told Cal “you are not ready yet to be part of any army” (94).</strong></p></li>

<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Reasoning</p>
<p><strong>Cal sometimes has premonitions where he vividly imagines things that could happen soon in the future. He has one of these premonitions about Pop. In that vision, he imagines Pop being shot during the campaign. Cal will be so worried about Pop if he doesn’t go try to help him.</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Reasoning</p>
<p><strong>The reason why Cal did not go with Pop to DC to begin with was because Pop said that it would be too dangerous for him. Circumstances haven’t changed, which means that it would still be too dangerous. Cal has even read in the newspaper that some people marching in the campaign have gotten hurt or sent to jail. It’s still too dangerous for a kid.</strong></p></td>

<td><p>Evidence</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Deacon believes that Cal should listen to his premonition: “My granddad . . . told me that seeing that way can be more of a warning than a prophecy. Letting you know what might happen, not what has to happen” (282); Deacon knew that Cal was going to have a premonition before it even happened.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deacon had a premonition, too.</strong></p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Cal says to himself that he won’t run away “because of my promise to him to stick it out till he either sends for me or shows up to get me” (245).</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cal wants to do what Pop says: “I will do my best to make you proud of me” (232).</strong></p></li>

</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Reasoning</p>
<p><strong>Deacon tells Cal that premonitions can show what might happen. This means that Cal might be able to stop this from happening. Also, Deacon had a premonition, too. He knew about Cal’s premonition before it even happened. Cal should believe what Deacon says.</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Reasoning</p>
<p><strong>Cal has promised Pop that he will stay at Challagi and wait for Pop to come get him after the campaign is over. Pop cares about Cal’s best interests, and Cal should continue to trust him and his decisions.</strong></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Reason</p>
<p><strong>Cal does not want to be at Challagi.</strong></p></td>

<p><strong>Cal is doing well at Challagi.</strong></p></td>

<td><p>Evidence</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Cal wonders how long he is going to be stuck at Challagi—“how long am I going to be here?” (258).</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>He worries that Pop will not get him—“is he ever going to come back for me?” (268).</strong></p></li>
</ul></td>
<td><p>Evidence</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Cal is making friends for the first time in his life, like Possum: “such a true friend—my first real friend” (283), as well as Little Coon and Deacon; “I feel like I belong to our gang” (253).</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exploring his Creek identity: “Maybe I’m not totally Indian, but I’m not the same as I was before. I’m seeing things another way” (253).</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Getting an education and learning new things: “I have done just about every possible job a boy can do” (260), such as shoe and harness, power plant maintenance and plumbing, printing, painting, masonry, electric wiring.</strong></p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Reasoning</p>
<p><strong>Cal never wanted to be at Challagi, but he went anyway. Now, even though he made good friends, he still does not want to be there. He wants to be with Pop. Cal gave Challagi a good try. If he is still unhappy there, it’s okay that he leaves.</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Reasoning</p>
<p><strong>Despite the harsh conditions of the school, Cal is finding a lot of benefits. He is socializing with kids his own age and making lots of friends. He is also learning many useful skills.</strong></p></td>

<tr class="even">

<li><p><strong>Pop reminds Cal that he will return—“Meanwhile, son, hang in there. With luck I may be able to come and get you at the end of the school term” (268).</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pop sends a letter to Superintendent Morrell and asks permission for Cal to stay at Challagi.</strong></p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Reasoning</p>
<p><strong>Pop and Cal are very close. They have no other family members. It is clear that Cal misses Pop a lot because of how much he thinks about him and how anxiously he awaits Pop’s letters. Cal will be much happier if he is with Pop.</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Reasoning</p>
<p><strong>Pop still wants Cal to wait for him, safely and patiently, at Challagi. In a letter to Cal, Pop reminds him that he will return for him as soon as the campaign is over. He wants Cal to be patient. In another letter, to Superintendent Morrell, Pop requests that Cal be allowed to stay at Challagi over the summer.</strong></p></td>
