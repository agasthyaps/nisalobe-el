**Directions:** As you enter class, read the learning targets. Next, read through the Model Literary Argument Evidence note-catcher.

Read the claim statement at the bottom of the note-catcher. Based on what you read, why do you believe the author of the model essay chose this claim? Explain your reasoning.

Sample student response: The claim that Pop should not bring Cal to Washington, DC with him has more evidence. This means that this claim is stronger. The author chose this claim because the author wants to choose the strongest position to defend.
