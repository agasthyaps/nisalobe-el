Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.6.8 – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they trace the argument and the main claim statement presented in the Model Literary Argument Evidence note-catcher.

- RL.6.1 – Work Time A: Students collect text evidence on their Literary Argument Evidence note-catchers to support their claims in their collaborative literary argument essays.

- W.6.1b – Work Time A: Students develop the main claims in their collaborative essays and locate relevant evidence in the text to support their claims.

- W.6.9a – Work Time A: Students collect textual evidence to inform their analysis of the text and support the reasons presented in their collaborative literary argument essays.

- RL.6.1 – Work Time B: Students incorporate textual evidence into their Literary Argument Writing Plan graphic organizers to support the reasons presented in their essays.

- RL.6.3 – Work Time B: Students use information about the plot of *Two Roads* and Cal’s character development to help develop their essays.

- W.6.1a – Work Time B: Students plan their collaborative essays, using their Literary Argument Writing Plan graphic organizers to introduce their main claim and organize their reasons and evidence.

- W.6.1b – Work Time B: On their Literary Argument Writing Plan graphic organizers, students support the claims of their collaborative essays with clear reasons and relevant evidence.

- W.6.4 – Work Time B: Students work with their partners to plan a clear and coherent literary argument essay, whose organization is appropriate to task, purpose, and audience.

- W.6.5 – Work Time B: With support from their partners, students plan and develop their collaborative essays.

- SL.6.1 – Closing and Assessment A: Students participate in a Peer Share discussion, offering stars and steps to support their classmates’ writing.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to contribute to a better world, using their strengths when working with a partner to give and receive feedback on their plans.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Some students may not need the level of scaffolding provided in this lesson. Release them to work independently if they are ready to begin filling in the evidence note-catcher and writing planner without additional support.

- Challenge students to incorporate evidence from some of the other sources they read during this module, such as the Meriam Report. Guide students to meaningfully tie evidence from these sources into their argument.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students analyzed the structure of the model essay using the Painted Essay® template. In this lesson, students will begin collecting evidence for their own collaborative literary argument essay, then begin filling in a writing planner with their partner.

Support All Students

- Note that there is a differentiated version of the Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 2 used in Opening A in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- The Collaborative Literary Argument Essay requires a considerable amount of focused pairwork across many lessons. Make strategic grouping choices to ensure that all students, including ELLs, are supported in their pairs. Pairing students with high and low language proficiencies together may be a useful scaffolding approach; however, make sure that differences in language ability are not so stark that one student entirely dominates the evidence-gathering and writing planning process. ▲

- Some students may feel more prepared than others to contribute to the writing planners with a partner. Emphasize that planning writing is a process and collaboration is mutually beneficial. Remind students that they can continue to complete their planners at home if they were unable to complete the entire task during Work Time B.

- Completing the Collaborative Literary Argument Evidence note-catcher could take longer than 20 minutes. Encourage students to adopt good research practices (e.g., always including page numbers, using shorthand, color-coding with markers or highlighters) to make their evidence-gathering more efficient. Additionally, help students with time-management by setting a timer for 10 minutes and reminding students to divide their time evenly between both sides of the note-catcher. Partners could also assign themselves each one side of the note-catcher to complete and then share their responses with each other after several minutes of independent work.

- Encourage students to represent evidence on their note-catchers in a way that works for them. If available, allow students to use materials like markers of different colors or sticky notes to organize their ideas.

- Beyond easing the cognitive load of producing the essay, the writing planner also allows students to plot the structure of their essays and, later, monitor their progress toward writing goals.

- To support ELLs, this lesson models the process of collecting information on a note-catcher, adapting this information for a writing planner, and then finally, producing an essay based on the planner. By working with the note-catcher and planner for the literary argument essay, students can practice these steps before applying them to the planning of their own collaborative essays later in the lesson. Taking the time to understand the relationship across these materials and how they inform one another (1) clarifies expectations for ELLs as they prepare and produce their own writing and (2) highlights the nature of writing as an iterative, multistep process (i.e., one in which learning is incremental and perfection is not expected).

- ELLs may find it challenging to collaboratively plan an essay during Work Time B, even though they completed similar tasks in Modules 1 and 2. Take the time to pair students very strategically, taking into consideration English-language proficiency, writing abilities, and general rapport. Help students develop collaborative strategies that work for them and their partners (e.g., negotiating ideas aloud before writing them independently; writing independently first and then comparing notes and adding or modifying note-catchers as needed; designating alternating “scribes” to take notes as the other student shares ideas aloud, etc.).

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.4, 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.7, 6.I.C.10, 6.I.C.11, 6.I.C.12, 6.II.A.1, 6.II.A.2, 6.II.B.5, 6.II.C.6, and 6.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- Writing partners will divide the work on the Collaborative Literary Argument Evidence note-catcher, each choosing one position for which they will find reasons and evidence. Students may feel frustrated if, after spending time filling in their note-catcher, their position is not chosen when determining a claim for their collaborative essay. Ensure students that their work has not gone wasted; thinking about all sides of an issue helps a writer to anticipate counterclaims, thus strengthening the reasoning they will need to better defend their claim.

- Ensure that students understand how the note-catcher leads into the writing planner and then the essay. Students should see writing as a process beginning with gathering information, organizing that information, then, finally, presenting the information in a composition.

- Consider using the Grade 6 Writing Process Checklist to assess students’ writing abilities in Work Time B (see the Tools page: http://eled.org/tools).

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will use their completed writing planner to continue working on their collaborative essay, focusing specifically on drafting the introduction.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Strategically form writing partnerships for the collaborative writing process. Keep in mind that these partners will be working together for several lessons. Consider also if triads rather than pairs is a better option for the collaborative writing task.

- Review the content in the Model Literary Argument Evidence note-catcher, Model Literary Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer, and Model Literary Argument Essay in preparation for guiding students to see how each reflects the others.

- Much of the information students will record on the writing planner will already have been gathered on the evidence note-catcher. Determine whether students will be required to recopy their evidence and reasoning into the Proof Paragraphs section of the writing planner, or if they can simply make a note on the writing planner referring back to the evidence note-catcher for the pertinent info. For some students, the step of copying it over to their writing planner is a helpful support; for others, it may be redundant.

- Review the student tasks and example answers to get familiar with what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Prepare copies of handouts for students, including entrance ticket (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RI.6.8 (5 minutes)

- Distribute the **Model Literary Argument Evidence note-catcher** and **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 2** or the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 2** ▲. Follow the same routine as previous lessons to review Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 2. Refer to the **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 2 (example for teacher reference)** for possible responses.

- Explain that the author of the Model Literary Argument Evidence note-catcher decided on the claim: Pop should not bring Cal to Washington DC with him. Focus students on the column of reasons supporting this claim.

- Turn and Talk:

“Read through each of the reasons for Position 2, and their corresponding evidence and reasoning. Which two reasons should the author include in the essay? Why would you choose these?”

- If productive, use strategic combinations of Conversation Cues to help students listen to one another and and expand the conversation. ▲ For example:

- “Who can tell us what your classmate said in your own words?” (Goal 2)

- “Who can explain why your classmate came up with that response?” (Goal 4)

- “Can you say more about that?” (Goal 1)

- “Who can add on to what your classmate said?” (Goal 4)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar to or the same as previous lessons. Invite students to choose a habit of character focus for themselves for this lesson.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- During Opening A, invite students who need heavier support to use the Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 2 ▲. This resource features sentence starters to support student comprehension and reduce the amount of writing students are expected to produce.

Work Time

A. Collect Evidence and Make Claim – RL.6.3, W.6.1 (20 minutes)

- Distribute the **Collaborative Literary Argument Evidence note-catcher**. Explain that this note-catcher is to help them collect and analyze evidence for a practice essay which they will plan and write in collaboration with a partner.

- Draw students’ attention to the focus question on the note-catcher, and call on a student to read it aloud:

- “Should Cal leave Challagi Indian Industrial School to find Pop?”

- Remind students that, since they have finished reading the novel, they already know that Cal does decide to leave. However, the purpose of this activity is to practice gathering evidence, making a claim, and composing an argument essay. Although they already know how the narrative turns out, encourage students to imagine other possibilities as they consider the focus question.

- Read the two column headings and the labels in the section below. Remind students that “reasons” refers to the reasons why Cal should or should not leave school to find Pop, “evidence” is the textual evidence that supports each reason, and “reasoning” is the elaboration that explains how the evidence supports the reason.

- Move students into their writing partnerships. Direct partners to each pick one position and focus on gathering reasons and evidence for just their assigned position.

- Encourage students to reference the anchor text ***Two Roads***, and any other note-catchers and anchor charts from previous units to support their work.

- As students work, circulate to push their thinking, provide support, and answer questions as needed. Refer to the **Collaborative Literary Argument Evidence note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** as needed.

- With two minutes remaining, refocus students. Referring back to the entrance ticket, explain that it is time to evaluate all of their evidence and make a claim, just as the author of the Model Literary Argument Evidence note-catcher did.

- Direct students to decide with their partner which position they can best argue and write a claim statement at the bottom of the note-catcher.

- If partners struggle to pick a position, direct them back to their entrance ticket and use the same logic used there to evaluate their own note-catchers.

Work Time

B. Group Practice: Plan a Literary Argument Essay – W.6.1, W.6.5 (15 minutes)

- Distribute and display the **Model Literary Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer**. Direct students to place the Model Literary Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer side-by-side with the Model Literary Argument Evidence note-catcher. Distribute highlighters. Distribute **green, yellow, and blue highlighters**.

- Direct students to use their green highlighter to highlight the claim on both the Model Literary Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer and the Model Literary Argument Evidence note-catcher.

- Direct students to use their yellow highlighter to highlight the reason, evidence, and reasoning included under Proof Paragraph 1 on the Model Literary Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer and then find and highlight the same on the Model Literary Argument Evidence note-catcher.

- Direct students to use their blue highlighter to highlight the reason, evidence, and reasoning included under Proof Paragraph 2 on the Model Literary Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer and then find and highlight the same on the Model Literary Argument Evidence note-catcher.

- Distribute the **Collaborative Literary Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer**. Explain that students should make the same connections between their evidence note-catcher and the writing planner as they did with the model.

- Remind students that they have used a similar tool in previous modules, and that much of the information they will record on this planner, they have already found when they were filling in the evidence note-catcher. For some students, the step of copying it over to their writing planner is a helpful support; for others, it may be redundant. Clarify the requirements for students based on their needs.

- Ensure that students understand their task before releasing them to begin working.

- Circulate and monitor, using the **Collaborative Literary Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- With one minute remaining, refocus students’ attention. Explain that if they were unable to complete the writing planner during this time, they will need to complete it for homework in preparation for drafting the introduction in the next lesson. If needed, direct students to assign responsibility within their partnerships for completing the planner for any remaining paragraphs.

- Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target, using a checking for understanding. Scan student responses and make a note of students who might need support. Check in with them moving forward.

Closing and Assessment

A. Peer Share: Writing Planners – W.6.1, SL.6.1 (5 minutes)

- Direct partnerships to join another pair, and share their in-progress argument writing planners for feedback. Each partnership will give one star and one step to help the other pair improve their planner.

- Explain that feedback is often best presented in the form of a question that guides the presenter to elaborate on the topic and add more details.

- Post and read aloud the following sentence frames:

- “Can you say more about . . . ?”

- “Will you explain what you mean by . . . ?”

- “I found myself wondering . . . ?”

- Direct students to use at least one of the sentence frames when giving feedback to the other partnership. Invite students to begin.

- Once groups are done sharing, field any new questions about the specifics of the writing planner.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

For Lighter Support

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using the main claim from the Model Literary Argument Essay. Consider providing ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Invite students who need lighter support to choose one of the following tasks to complete in preparation for the Language Dive:

- Rearrange the two clauses of the sentence, appropriately adjusting punctuation, capitalization, and other language as needed.

- Add the word *because* to the end of the sentence and add a reason.

- Write down three qualities of the sentence that make it an effective main claim.

For Heavier Support

- In the next lesson, students will participate in a Language Dive using the main claim from the Model Literary Argument Essay. Consider providing ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Invite students who need heavier support to choose one of the following tasks to complete in preparation for the Language Dive:

- Replace the words *although* and *sad* with synonyms without disrupting the meaning of the sentence.

- Write down one question about the sentence that could be asked during a Language Dive.

- Separate the sentence into two simpler sentences.

Homework

A. Plan a Collaborative Literary Argument Essay

- Students work to complete their assigned section of the Collaborative Literary Argument Writing Plan graphic organizer.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their **independent reading journal**.
