Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.6.1 – Work Time A: Students participate in the Voices of American Indian Boarding Schools Audio Museum event. They answer questions about their classmate’s performance task recordings, using evidence from the recording to support their analysis.

- RI.6.6 – Work Time A: Students analyze the point of view and purpose of their classmates’ prefaces, selected texts, and reflections.

- SL.6.2 – Work Time A: Students listen to their classmates’ performance task recordings. They review the key ideas expressed in the recordings and demonstrate understanding on their audio museum: Responses and Reflections note-catchers.

- SL.6.1 – Closing and Assessment A: Students engage in a discussion to reflect upon and draw connections between the performance task and the module overall, and synthesize and celebrate learning.

- L.6.6 – Closing and Assessment A: Students use appropriate academic language during a class discussion.

- In this lesson, the habit of character focus is on working to become an ethical person. Students show respect and compassion when they listen to and reflect upon the recordings of their classmates during the audio museum. Through this performance task, students contribute to a better world by sharing their learning with a larger community.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- One aim of this performance task is to help students make heard and known the stories of students who attended American Indian boarding schools. To heighten the impact of students’ work and broaden the audience who will benefit from the students’ work, consider making the recordings available as a resource for other students (i.e., by providing copies of recordings in the school library or sharing them with a local historical organization).

- Students who excel at graphic design could be tasked with creating promotional materials for the audio museum, such as fliers, posters, and programs. Allow students to experiment with a free online, design tool, such as Canva, to create these materials.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- This performance task is a culminating celebration of learning across Module 3. In Unit 1, students built their background knowledge of American Indian boarding schools by reading supplemental texts that highlighted the experiences of former students. For the performance task, students independently selected excerpts from similar texts to share in a recording during the audio museum. In Unit 2, students practiced using recording equipment to record themselves reading aloud their narrative letters; students prepare and present more developed and polished recordings as part of the performance task. The module reflection that concludes the lesson invites students to draw connections among the performance task, the anchor text, and the module overall.

Support All Students

- Some students may feel nervous imagining others listen to their recordings; this anxiety may be felt especially by ELLs, for whom it may feel especially threatening to imagine that their language is being evaluated, even if just privately and implicitly. Validate students’ feelings and concerns, if they come up. Take time to guide students through the questions on the Performance Task: Audio Museum Responses and Reflections handout to reinforce that performance task is not an assessment; the questions on the handout invite listeners’ responses to the content, but do not ask for listeners to critique the recordings themselves. ▲

- If ELLs need extra support as they listen to their classmates’ recordings, invite them to listen to recordings multiple times at the same listening station. This repetition is beneficial to ELLs, who are more likely to comprehend the recordings if they hear them more than once. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson centers around a culminating performance task intended to celebrate and synthesize students’ learning. During the Voices of American Indian Boarding Schools Audio Museum, students share with classmates and visitors the recordings they have developed across Lessons 10–12. The design of the audio museum is especially supportive of ELLs. Rather than asking students to participate in live presentations of their selected texts, which can be nerve-wracking for students who need heavier English-language support, the audio museum features recordings that students had multiple lessons to prepare, create, reflect upon, and refine.

- ELLs may find it challenging to interpret the texts recorded by their classmates during the audio museum. For ELLs that need heavier support during listening activities, comprehending recordings that are not accompanied by body language or facial expressions can be difficult. Remind them that the purpose of the audio museum is not necessarily to understand every word heard, but instead, to recognize and appreciate the impact of the personal stories of students of American Indian boarding schools.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.2, 6.I.A.4, 6.I.B.5, 6.I.B.7, 6.II.B.8, 6.II.A.1, and 6.II.C.6.

Assessment Guidance

- The performance tasks at the end of every module are neither formative nor summative assessments. They are not formative since they come at the end of the module, concluding students’ learning about the module topic and the literacy skills they have built over eight or nine weeks. However, they are also not summative because they are heavily scaffolded to help students create high-quality work, and so are not a strong measure of what students can do independently. For these reasons, we do not recommend analyzing performance tasks with the same lens used to analyze assessments. Look at students’ performance tasks through the lens of the attributes of high-quality student work (authenticity, complexity, craftsmanship).

Down the Road

- This lesson concludes Module 3. In Module 4, students explore the topic of space science and examine the scientific and social contributions of “hidden figures” in the field, whose stories are often untold in historical accounts of key scientific events.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare the equipment needed for guests to listen to the recordings. Arrange the museum “exhibit” area to allow for guests to freely move to each listening station. Set up any visuals or other artifacts that will be featured at each student’s listening station.

- Determine how students will visit their peers’ listening stations during the audio museum. If it is only feasible to have one listener at each station at a time (e.g., there is a single pair of headphones available at each station), consider inviting students to start at their own listening stations, and then move from station to station clockwise. If multiple listeners can be supported at each station (e.g., there are QR codes available that allow students to listen to recordings on their own phones), consider inviting students to move among stations in strategically assigned home-language pairs for additional support. ▲

- As needed, review the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol from the Classroom Protocols document located on the Tools page (http://eled.org/tools).

- Review the student tasks and example answers to get familiar with what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Prepare copies of handouts for students (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time A: Prepare the equipment needed for guests to listen to the recordings. Arrange the museum “exhibit” area to allow for guests to freely move to each listening station. Set up any visuals or other artifacts that will be featured at each student’s listening station.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar to or the same as previous lessons.

- Focus students on the **Performance Task anchor chart** and remind them of where this work has all been leading. Remind students that in this lesson they will participate in an audio museum and a culminating discussion to share, synthesize, and celebrate their learning across the module.

- Focus students on the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**. Invite students to Turn and Talk to an elbow partner and share good ways to demonstrate *respect* during the audio museum.

- Direct students to their assigned listening stations. Instruct students to set up their audio so that it can be heard by visitors. If students developed visuals or printed QR codes, those can be displayed at this time.

Work Time

A. Participate in Audio Museum – SL.6.2 (30 minutes)

- Distribute the **Performance Task Audio Museum Responses and Reflections note-catcher** handout. Read the directions aloud to the students. Clarify any questions students may have. Students will complete the handout as they visit their classmate’s listening stations.

- Welcome any additional guests who may have arrived to participate in the audio museum. Invite students and guests to begin listening to the recordings presented at listening stations around the classroom.

- Circulate around the room. Support students and guests at listening stations as necessary.

- After the allotted time for the exhibition has expired, invite audience members to join in a show of appreciation for all the presenters. Invite students to join in a gesture of appreciation for all the audience members. Say goodbye to the guests.

- Give students specific, positive feedback on their participation in the audio museum (e.g., “I heard a lot of you assisting the guests in accessing your recording and then elaborating on what it meant to you and what you have learned.”).

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- During the audio museum of Work Time A, invite students who need heavier support to refer to their Performance Task Recording: Text Lists from Lessons 8–9 while listening to their classmate’s recordings. After listening to the preface, they can locate the recorded text on the reference sheet and follow along as the speaker reads.

Closing and Assessment

A. Module Reflection – SL.6.1 (10 minutes)

- Ensure students understand the directions for back-to-back and face-to-face. (Refer to the Classroom Protocols document for the full version of the protocol.) Use the **Module Reflection: Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face (for teacher reference)** to guide students through the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol.

- Circulate and monitor student responses during the protocol. After completing the protocol, refocus whole group. Invite students to share any particular meaningful insights that arose during the culminating reflection. Congratulate students on successfully completing the performance task and Module 3.
