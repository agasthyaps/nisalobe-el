Voices of Native American Boarding Schools Audio Museum Performance Task

Create a museum exhibit made up of audio recordings using narratives by students of American Indian boarding schools.

**Steps**

1.  Select a text (a poem, personal narrative, etc.) written by a survivor of the boarding schools.

2.  Write a preface for the text that introduces it and provides context.

3.  Write a reflection that explains why the text is meaningful.

4.  Record yourself reading your preface, text, and reflection aloud using proper and respectful intonation, volume, and pacing.

5.  Review and re-record your reading, polishing it to perfection!

6.  Design a listening station for guests to visit and listen to your recording.

7.  Welcome guests to the audio museum! Listen to the recordings of your classmates, and answer questions about three classmates’ recordings on a note-catcher.

8.  Engage in a whole class discussion about the connections between the performance task and the module overall.

**Purpose**

Through our work before and during the audio museum, we can help make sure that these powerful stories about American Indian boarding schools are exposed to a wider audience.
