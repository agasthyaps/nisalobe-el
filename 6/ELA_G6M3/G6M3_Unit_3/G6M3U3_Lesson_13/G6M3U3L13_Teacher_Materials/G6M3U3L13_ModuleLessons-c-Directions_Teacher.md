Module Reflection:  
Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face

(For Teacher Reference)

Students will reflect on the performance task and its connections to the module by engaging in the Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face protocol. The purpose of this particular protocol is to share information and gain multiple perspectives through partner interaction.

Consider displaying the questions as they are asked to aid comprehension.

- Position partners back-to-back.

- Ask one question from the list below. Repeat the question to aid listening comprehension.

- Allow time for students to think before giving the signal for students to turn front-to-front with their partner.

- Remind students to listen carefully as each partner shares.

- Give the signal for students to return to the back-to-back position.

- Repeat for each of the questions listed below.

1.  Briefly describe one memorable narrative that you heard in a classmate’s recording today. What made it memorable?

2.  How did it make you feel to hear multiple pieces about American Indian boarding schools read aloud during the audio museum today? Be specific and give examples.

3.  How do you think Cal, Pop, or Possum might have felt if they had attended the audio museum and heard our recordings? Explain your answer.

4.  How did participating in the audio museum help you better understand the module topic overall?

5.  What else can we as individuals, as a class, or as a community do to make sure that the voices of American Indian boarding schools are shared with a broader audience?
