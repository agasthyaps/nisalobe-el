Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- SL.6.1b – Work Time A: Students generate discussion norms for the next lesson’s text-based discussion. This exercise requires that students review and understand the rules for a collegial discussion.

- RL.6.1 – Work Time B: Students prepare for a text-based discussion by completing a note-catcher that requires them to use textual evidence to support their inferences and their analysis of what the text says explicitly.

- RL.6.3 – Work Time B: Students use a note-catcher to track how Percy responds to challenges in *The Lightning Thief* and what his responses reveal about his character.

- SL.6.1a – Closing and Assessment A: Students provide peer feedback on one another’s Prepare for Text-Based Discussion: *The Lightning Thief*, Chapters 1–12 note-catchers in preparation for the next lesson’s text-based discussion.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Offer a mini lesson on citing text evidence with parenthetical documentation for students who are ready for an advanced writing technique.

- Press students to use a thesaurus as they fill in their Text-Based Discussion note-catcher. Under the final column, challenge students to find increasingly sophisticated synonyms to describe Percy’s characteristics.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons students have closely read through chapter 11 of *The Lightning Thief*, found the gist, determined the meaning of unfamiliar words and phrases, and analyzed how Percy has responded to challenges. In this lesson, students collect their thinking about how Percy has responded to challenges in preparation for the End of Unit 1 Assessment.

Support All Students

- Note there is a differentiated version of the Prepare for Text-Based Discussion: *The Lightning Thief*, Chapters 1–12 note-catcher used in Work Time B in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Students may need additional support working independently to prepare for the text-based discussion. Work in small groups with students who may find this challenging. ▲

- Remind students of previous conversations around the way that Percy faces challenges. Compile a chart with the responses from those prior discussions for students to refer back to during Work Time A.

- Encourage students to make personal connections during the discussion of facing challenges. Ask how students respond to challenges and what this reveals about them before applying this same thinking to Percy.

- Break up the heavy cognitive work in this lesson by incorporating a movement activity. Use a protocol like Back-to-Back and Face-to-Face during the Closing and Assessment to give students an opportunity to move around.

- To support ELLs, this lesson cultivates academic speaking skills, prepares students for the text-based discussion of the End of Unit 1 Assessment, and provides choices for students to work together or independently, depending on how much support they feel they need.

- ELLs may find it challenging to prepare for the text-based discussion. Remind them that today’s lesson is designed to make them feel as ready as possible for this assessment.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.3, 6.I.A.4, and 6.I.C.11a.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ note-catchers as they work and after the lesson to ensure that they are fully prepared for the discussion.

Down the Road

- In the next two lessons, students will synthesize their prior learning to engage in a text-based discussion, the End of Unit 1 Assessment.

- During Unit 2, students continue reading the novel, focusing on Percy’s character and themes in comparison to the Greek myths to which they’ve been introduced through the novel. They also view clips from the film version of *The Lightning Thief* to compare the experience of reading versus viewing the story.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RL.6.3 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 14**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Generate Discussion Norms – SL.6.1b (5 minutes)

- Remind students of the practice Socratic Seminar they participated in during Lesson 13. Refocus students on the Discussion Norms anchor chart they began in that lesson.

- Create a chart with two columns at the bottom of the **Discussion Norms anchor chart**, with one labeled “Cue” and the other labeled “Response.”

- Ask:

“How did either the group or you encourage someone else to clarify when you didn’t understand? What questions can you ask when you don’t understand what someone is saying?”

“How did you find out more about the ideas of others? What questions can you ask when you want to find out more?”

- As students share, capture their responses in the Response column at the bottom of the Discussion Norms anchor chart. Refer to the **Discussion Norms anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Ask:

“How can you respond when you are asked to clarify or to elaborate on an idea?”

- As students share out, capture their responses in the Response column at the bottom of the Discussion Norms anchor chart. Refer to the Discussion Norms anchor chart (example for teacher reference) as necessary.

- Explain that they’ll continue to prepare for the discussion in this lesson, and they’ll continue to practice and build their understanding about effective discussion throughout the module.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- Introduce a mini lesson or provide resources that help students identify appropriate language for turn-taking. Common phrases like, “I see your point, and I’d like to add \_\_\_\_\_” or “I agree because \_\_\_\_\_” will help ease the cognitive demands of a class discussion.

Work Time

B. Prepare for a Text-Based Discussion – RL.6.3 (25 minutes)

- Distribute and display the **Prepare for Text-Based Discussion: *The Lightning Thief***, **Chapters 1–12 note-catcher** or **Prepare for Text-Based Discussion: *The Lightning Thief***, **Chapters 1–12 note-catcher** ▲.

- Read, reread, and rephrase the prompt at the top of the note-catcher aloud for the group:

“How does Percy respond to challenges? What can we infer about his character?”

- Tell students that in this lesson, they gather evidence from *The Lightning Thief* in preparation for discussing this prompt as part of the End of Unit 1 Assessment. Ask them to retrieve their copies of ***The Lightning Thief***, their gist statements, and their **vocabulary logs**.

- If productive, invite students to reflect on the text-based discussion question and ask clarifying questions before digging into the text for evidence. ▲

- Tell students they have the option of working alone or with a partner to complete their note-catchers. Emphasize that as this contains a personal response, students may wish to do this alone, but invite those who want to work with someone to move to a certain area of the room to pair up with someone else who wants to work with a partner. Invite students to verbally “complete” the note-catcher in home language groupings. They can then focus on writing notes in their home language or English, or making sketches as placeholders, and finally discussing in English. ▲

- Direct students’ attention to the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**. Focus students on empathy and respect, and remind them to attend to these habits of character as they work in their groups. Invite students to begin working.

- Circulate to support students in completing their Prepare for Text-Based Discussion: *The Lightning Thief*, Chapters 1–12 note-catcher. Refer to **Prepare for Text-Based Discussion: *The Lightning Thief***, **Chapters 1–12 note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** as needed.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Closing and Assessment

A. Peer Feedback – SL.6.1a (10 minutes)

- Invite students to pair up and share their Prepare for Text-Based Discussion: *The Lightning Thief*, Chapters 1–12 note-catcher, making additions and revising as necessary after seeing what their peer has done.

- Direct students’ attention to the Discussion Norms anchor chart they created in Lesson 13. Ask students to share with their partners the one norm they think will be the easiest for them during tomorrow’s discussion and the one that will be the most difficult. Invite them to work together to generate ideas about how to do better with the more difficult norms. If time allows, ask a few pairs to share their ideas. Use this sharing to start the next lesson before their discussion.

For Lighter Support

- Provide students with a list of guiding questions they can use to generate feedback for their peers on the Prepare for a Text-Based Discussion note-catcher

For Heavier Support

- Provide students with a short checklist and/or sentence frames that they can use to generate feedback for their peers on the Prepare for a Text-Based Discussion note-catcher

Homework

A. Preread Anchor Text

- Students should preread chapter 12 of *The Lightning Thief*, paying careful attention to pages 188–196, in preparation for the End of Unit 1 Assessment.
