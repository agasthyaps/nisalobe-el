**Directions:** Use your text and the gist statements you have written for each chapter to complete the chart below and prepare for discussion.

**How does Percy respond to challenges? What can we infer about his character?**

1.  Choose three of the challenges Percy has faced so far. For each, record Percy’s response to the challenge in the form of the choices he makes. Finally, reflect on what Percy’s response might reveal about his character. Record your thinking in the chart below. (RL.6.1, RL.6.3)
