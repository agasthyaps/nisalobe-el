<p><strong>Percy didn’t have time to respond when the hound attacked, so he was bitten.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Percy is stunned when Annabeth begins to figure out who his father is, and when he is claimed by his father and everyone bows.</strong></p></td>

<p><strong>Percy is seemingly at the mercy of the creatures and events at Camp Half-Blood.</strong></p>
<p>Percy still doesn’t fully believe the magnitude of what’s happened and who his father is. He is feeling overwhelmed and still confused.</p></td>
