Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- This lesson is comprised of two lessons, for a total of 90 minutes, that end Unit 1. If it isn’t possible to facilitate this lesson over a continuous 90-minute time period, ensure that in breaking up the lesson, the learning targets are reviewed in both lessons.

- RL.6.1 – Work Time A: Students read the next chapter of the text and find the gist. Students also unpack unfamiliar vocabulary and answer comprehension questions using inferences and evidence from text.

- Work Time B: Students complete the End of Unit 1 Assessment, in which they participate in a group discussion about how Percy responds to and changes as a result of the events during the first half of the novel and answer short response questions requiring them to quote accurately from the text and to determine key events from the first half of the novel. To hear all students discuss, create two groups and provide 20 minutes for each group’s discussion. When students are not involved in the discussions, they should complete Part II of the assessment independently. (RL.6.1, RL.6.3, SL.6.1a, SL.6.1b)

- SL.6.1b – Closing and Assessment A: Students reflect on their learning using the Track Progress: Collaborative Discussion recording form and following rules for collegial discussions. This exercise is meant to provide students time to formally keep track of and reflect on their own learning. This self-reflection supports metacognition and pride in work and learning.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Some students may be ready to read the chapter and prepare for the End of Unit 1 Assessment without direction. Release them to this independence if they are ready for it.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students prepared for this assessment by completing the Text-Based Discussion note-catcher with evidence of how Percy responds to and changes as a result of the events of the first half of the novel. In the assessment, they discuss their ideas about what readers can learn about Percy’s character by how he responds to the struggles he has faced and also consider which events so far in the novel were most significant.

Support All Students

- As before, continue to be mindful about the issues and characterizations noted previously that may be sensitive for students or with which some students may connect personally or deeply. Monitor students, and determine if there are issues surfacing that need to be discussed in more detail as a whole group, in smaller groups, or independently. Be aware that reflections may be personal, and students are not required to share them.

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment.

- Some students may require more than the time allotted to complete the assessment.

- To support ELLs, this lesson gives students an opportunity to consolidate and demonstrate their content and language knowledge in a text-based discussion built on their preparation and practice in previous lessons. Students also have an opportunity to track and celebrate their successes.

- ELLs may find it challenging or intimidating to participate in the discussion beyond reading directly from their note-catchers. Encourage them to use the resources available to them (e.g., the Discussion Norms anchor chart, Conversation Cues) to clarify and/or elaborate upon their classmates’ comments. Additionally, the practice of self-assessment may be new for some students. Be patient and affirming. Model examples and ask guiding questions.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.3, 6.I.A.4, and 6.I.C.11a.

Assessment Guidance

- End of Unit 1 Assessment: Text-Based Discussion: *The Lightning Thief*, Chapters 1–12 (for students) and End of Unit 1 Assessment: Teacher Scoring Materials are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback to students on this assessment, use the Collaborative Discussion checklist (see Assessment Overview and Resources) to help complete the student Track Progress recording form. Make notes in the appropriate column for each criterion in a different color from student responses. There is also space provided to respond to student comments.

- In this assessment, students track progress toward anchor standard SL.1: *Prepare for and participate effectively in a range of conversations and collaborations with diverse partners, building on others’ ideas and expressing my own clearly and persuasively.* Specifically, students are working on substandards a and b, being prepared and using evidence from the text to support ideas and follow discussion norms.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students begin Unit 2, during which they continue reading excerpts from the novel, focusing on Percy’s character and themes in comparison to the Greek myths to which they’ve been introduced through the novel.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Ensure Mid-Unit 1 Assessments with feedback are available for each student at tables.

- Review the student tasks and example answers to become familiar with what students are required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Review the Socratic Seminar protocol.

- Prepare:

- End of Unit 1 Assessment (see Assessment Overview and Resources), and prepare the room for the Socratic Seminar discussion.

- Track Progress folder for each student. This is a folder with seven tabs, one for each type of Track Progress sheet students will complete: Collaborative Discussion; Informative Writing; Narrative Writing; Opinion Writing; Reading, Understanding and Explaining New Texts; and Research. Students will keep their Track Progress forms in this folder to refer to the relevant form before completing an assessment.

- Determine two student groups for the text-based discussion, as well as the order in which groups discuss. Post this information in a clearly visible location.

- Preread chapter 12 in *The Lightning Thief* to identify words or plot points that may challenge students.

- Prepare copies of handouts for students, including entrance ticket (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time A: Students may add to their Text-Based Discussion note-catcher

- using a word-processing tool—for example, a Google Doc;

- or in a word-processing document—for example, a Google Doc—using speech-to-text facilities activated on devices or using an app or software such as http://eled.org/0103.

- Closing and Assessment A: Students may create their Track Progress folders and form in an online format with a folder for each form

- using a word-processing tool—for example, a Google Doc;

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Return Mid-Unit Assessments (10 minutes)

- As students enter the classroom, distribute **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lessons 15–16**, and allow time for students to record their responses using their **Mid-Unit 1 Assessments with feedback**.

- Circulate as students review their feedback, and offer guidance and support as necessary.

- Once all students are ready, invite them to share their “stars” and “steps” with a partner. Remind students that everyone is working toward individual goals and that learning is about continued growth and development.

Opening

B. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 12 Excerpt – RL.6.1 (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Read aloud the selected excerpt, using **Text Guide: *The Lightning Thief*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Refer to the following resources as appropriate to support this section of the lesson: **Gist recording chart (example for teacher reference)**, **vocabulary logs**, **chapter synopsis**, and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Excerpt: Starting at page 190 “‘How are we going to get into the Underworld?’ I asked him” and ending at page 194 “‘ . . . Wake! the dead whispered. Wake!’”

- Gist: The trio returns a lost dog to get the reward money and buy a train ticket west.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- Recognize that students have come across many new words over the course of Unit 1. If there is extra time, encourage students to revisit and review the words in their vocabulary logs, brainstorming strategies for retention and opportunities for productive use.

Work Time

B. End of Unit 1 Assessment: Text-Based Discussion: *The Lightning Thief*, Chapters 1–12 (45 minutes)

- Review the learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can use evidence from the text to support my ideas during a text-based discussion.”

“I can follow discussion norms to have an effective text-based discussion.”

- Distribute **End of Unit 1 Assessment: Text-Based Discussion: *The Lightning Thief***, **Chapters 1–12**.

- Read aloud the directions for each part of the assessment as students silently follow along. Read, reread, and rephrase. Answer clarifying questions.

- Tell students that while they wait to participate in the discussion, they should complete Part II of the assessment independently and without talking. Remind them that this is an assessment. Display a “map” of the assessment. Example:

- Two parts:

- Part I: Collaborative discussion with small group

- Part II: Answer short response questions

- Focus students on all of the characteristics on the Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart: respect, compassion, and empathy in preparation for the discussion, and integrity in preparation for working independently on Part II of the assessment. Review what each characteristic looks like and sounds like.

- Focus students on the **Discussion Norms anchor chart**, specifically on the cues and responses. Remind them that a discussion is not just about saying what they want to say and then they are done. Effective participation is about listening to others and asking and answering questions to be completely clear about what others are saying and to clarify their own points.

- Ensure all students understand the assessment directions. Answer their questions, refraining from supplying answers to the assessment questions themselves.

- Direct students to retrieve their copies of ***The Lightning Thief*** and their completed **Prepare for Text-Based Discussion: *The Lightning Thief***, **Chapters 1–12 note-catcher**. Invite students to begin working on the assessment.

- One by one, call out groups to work in a discussion area away from other students so as not to disrupt them from working on Part II of the assessment. Allocate each group 20 minutes and facilitate a Socratic Seminar discussion in each of the 20-minute blocks.

- Invite the remaining students to begin working on Part II of the assessment.

- If productive, use a Goal 1 Conversation Cue to encourage students to expand their responses to the text-dependent questions by giving examples:

“Can you say more about that?”

“Can you give an example?”

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

- This is a baseline assessment—not all students have practiced a discussion yet, so this is to help determine where they are and what they need to work on.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- Be thoughtful about creating groups for the text-based discussion. It may be most helpful and appropriate to bring together students with a wide range of language abilities into one group; or, alternatively, allow ELLs who need heavier support to work together, to improve confidence and allow more equal contributions. Group strategically according to students’ needs.

Closing and Assessment

A. Track Progress – SL.6.1 (15 minutes)

- Give students specific positive feedback on their completion of the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment (e.g., “I was pleased to see a lot of you referring back to your texts to find details”).

- Distribute **Track Progress: Collaborative Discussion** and **Track Progress folders**. Tell students that successful learners keep track of and reflect on their own learning and that they will complete a form like this after most of their assessments.

- Select volunteers to read aloud each criterion for the whole group. After hearing each one read aloud, invite students to Turn and Talk with an elbow partner:

“What does that criterion mean, in your own words?” (Responses will vary.)

- Read the directions aloud for students, and answer clarifying questions. Explain the scale and what each number represents. They should give themselves a 3 if they think they have achieved that criterion in their reading of new texts, a 4 if they think they have done even more than the criterion asks, a 2 if they think they are nearly there but not quite, and a 1 if they think they still have a lot of work to do.

- Distribute sticky notes. Tell students to use these to identify evidence in their work from the unit of their progress toward each criterion.

- Tell students the sticky notes are for them to find evidence of the following criteria:

- SL.6.1a: Come to discussions prepared, having read or studied required material; explicitly draw on that preparation by referring to evidence on the topic, text, or issue to probe and reflect on ideas under discussion.

- SL.6.1b: Follow rules for collegial discussions, set specific goals and deadlines, and define individual roles as needed.

- Guide students through completing question 1 of the Track Progress form. If this is the first time students have completed this form, they may not be able to answer this question. In this situation, tell students to leave it blank, and explain that the next time they fill out the same form, they should be able to answer this question. If students completed these forms in Grade 5, they may look back to their Grade 5 forms.

- Point out the Teacher Response section under question 2. Tell students that later, they will read each student’s reflection and respond with feedback.

- Direction students’ attention to question 3 on the form, and select a volunteer to read it aloud for the group:

“How can I improve next time?”

- Invite students to reflect on their own or with a partner on how they can improve on this skill in the future. Select volunteers to share with the group.

- Invite students to record their thinking in the appropriate spot on the Track Progress form.

- Invite students to place the form in their Track Progress folder, and collect students’ folders.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- Accept a wide variety of responses on the Track Progress recording form (e.g., *visuals*, *keywords*, *translations into students’ home languages*).

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read independently for 20 minutes and select a prompt to respond to in their independent reading journals.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students should preread chapter 13 of *The Lightning Thief* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.
