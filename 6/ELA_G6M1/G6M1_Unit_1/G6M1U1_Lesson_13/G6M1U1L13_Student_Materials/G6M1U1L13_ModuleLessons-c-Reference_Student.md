Synopsis: *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 11

**Name:** **Date:**

- Percy, Grover, and Annabeth emerge from the woods and see Aunty Em’s Garden Gnome Emporium.

- Annabeth and Percy’s hunger drive them forward because Aunty Em’s is emitting the smell of hamburgers, but Grover is hesitant and untrusting of the place.

- Despite being served much-needed food, Annabeth is also convinced they should leave.

- Aunty Em persuades Percy to allow her to take a picture of them, and Aunty Em leads them into the yard with all of the statues.

- Annabeth becomes sure that Aunty Em means them harm, so Annabeth puts on her cap and pushes Grover and Percy to the ground.

- Everybody finally realizes that Aunty Em is actually Medusa, a monster with snakes for hair who can turn people into stone with her eyes.

- Grover uses the flying shoes to attack Medusa from the sky. Annabeth uses her invisibility to be a menace.

- Annabeth tells Percy to cut off her head, and Percy succeeds. Percy mails Medusa’s head to the gods at Mount Olympus.
