Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RL.6.4 – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket that requires interpreting the meaning of a word as it is used in *The Lightning Thief*.

- L.6.4 – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket that requires applying strategies to determine the meaning of an unknown word.

- SL.6.1 – Work Time A: Students engage in a Think-Pair-Share, which requires them to compose their thoughts before engaging in collaborative discourse.

- RL.6.6 – Work Time B: Students are introduced to point of view. Please note the definition of point of view provided in the Point of View anchor chart and how it encompasses the idea of perspective. Also note that, at this stage, students are not analyzing how point of view is developed. This will happen in the next lesson. Students also engage in their first QuickWrite, identifying the narrator’s point of view in the first chapter and practicing using text evidence to support their response. Throughout the modules, students write routinely using QuickWrites—sometimes during class, sometimes as a part of their homework.

- The activity students complete as they arrive in the classroom is to prepare them to create the Strategies to Answer Selected Response Questions anchor chart. As a class, they capture strategies on an anchor chart for reference in future lessons and assessments.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Students who are already familiar with first and third person points of view could be tasked with exploring other terms related to point of view (third person omniscient, third person limited).

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students read a synopsis and excerpt from the first chapter of *The Lightning Thief* and distinguished the difference between academic and domain-specific vocabulary. Throughout the unit, students continue to read the novel carefully and expand their vocabulary by categorizing new words and deciphering unfamiliar vocabulary using a variety of strategies.

- As students continue reading, they deepen their appreciation of the novel by analyzing how the narrator’s point of view is established and developed.

Support All Students

- Note there is a differentiated version of the entrance ticket used in Opening A in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- The lesson is written for the chapter 2 excerpt to be a read-aloud, but it can be organized in different ways to meet students’ needs. For example, students could read the chapter in pairs or triads, taking turns to read, or they could read with a smaller group of students who need additional support. ▲

- If students read in small groups, ensure that the noise level is controlled enough that students are able to hear and focus on the text.

- Some students may benefit from having paragraph frames as a scaffold for QuickWrites. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson introduces students to the concept of point of view in preparation for the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment and provides students with clear definitions of new terms via a detailed Point of View anchor chart.

- ELLs may find it challenging to apply their developing understanding of point of view to chapters 1 and 2 of the text. Allow students flexibility in their approach to QuickWrite 1. Accept bulleted responses, mental maps, and other representations of ideas. Work with them over time to translate these ideas into more fully developed, coherent responses.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.7, and 6.I.C.10b.

Assessment Guidance

- Monitor students as they analyze how the author illustrates Percy’s point of view toward Mr. Brunner in preparation for the QuickWrite: Point of View: *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 1. Preselect several pieces of relevant text evidence to guide struggling students.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue reading from *The Lightning Thief*, finding the gist of chapter 3. They continue to identify unfamiliar vocabulary, and analyze how the author develops point of view in preparation for the mid-unit assessment.

- The Strategies to Answer Selected Response Questions anchor chart introduced in this lesson is referred to throughout the module and the school year as students answer selected response questions in text-dependent questions and assessments.

- The Point of View anchor chart introduced in this lesson is referred to throughout the module.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.6.4 (5 minutes)

- As students enter the classroom, distribute **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 3** or optional **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 3** ▲, and allow time for students to record their responses.

- Turn and Talk:

“Which word best defines the word *vaporized* in the excerpt given from chapter 1 of *The Lightning Thief*?” (destroyed)

“What strategy did you use to determine your answer?” (Responses will vary, but may include: using context clues, drawing on prior knowledge, replacing each option into the sentence.)

- Direct students’ attention to the posted learning targets, and select a volunteer to read them aloud:

“I can identify strategies to answer selected response questions.”

“I can find the gist of chapter 2 of *The Lightning Thief*.”

“I can explain Percy’s point of view toward Mr. Brunner in chapter 1 of *The Lightning Thief*.”

- Present the learning targets in writing, orally, and accompanied by symbols, and then check for understanding by giving students time both to write or sketch and to orally paraphrase these targets. ▲

- Focus students on the word *strategies* and the phrase *point of view*. Use total participation techniques to select students to share what they think they mean, and, if they don’t know the meaning, share the strategies they could use to determine the meaning (context, affixes and roots, dictionary).

- If productive, use a Goal 1 Conversation Cue to encourage students to expand their ideas about the phrase *point of view* by giving examples.

“Can you give an example?”

- With student support, record the meanings of the word and phrase on the **academic word wall** with translations in students’ home languages (*strategies* – a plan of action or policy designed to achieve a major or overall aim; *point of view* – In narrative texts, the narrator’s position in relation to the story being told. It shows the opinion or feelings of the characters involved in a situation. Point of view is the way the author allows the reader to “hear” and “see” what is happening.). Write synonyms or sketch a visual above each key term to scaffold students’ understanding. ▲

- Invite students to record these words in their **vocabulary logs**.

- Turn and Talk:

“What do you think you will be doing in this lesson based on all three learning targets?” (reading the second chapter of the novel and focusing on point of view)

“Why are we doing this? How is it meaningful to you? How will it help you to be successful?” (It is important to consider an event or idea from another person’s perspective, or point of view.)

Opening

B. Strategies to Answer Selected Response Questions (5 minutes)

- Direct students’ attention to the relevant learning target, and select a volunteer to read it aloud:

“I can identify strategies to answer selected response questions.”

- Point to the term *selected response*. Remind students that the questions they answered with multiple options in the warm-up activity and in their Unit 1, Lesson 2 homework are called selected response, or multiple choice, questions. Using **equity sticks**, select volunteers to share strategies they used to answer the selected response questions in their homework.

- As students share out, capture their responses on the **Strategies to Answer Selected Response Questions anchor chart**. Refer to **Strategies to Answer Selected Response Questions anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Collect and review the answers to the other questions from **Homework: Lesson 2: Plot Review: *The Lightning Thief***, **Chapter 1** from the Unit 1, Lesson 2 Homework.

Work Time

A. Read *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 2 Excerpt – SL.6.1 (15 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can find the gist of chapter 2 of *The Lightning Thief*.”

- Invite students to retrieve their copy of ***The Lightning Thief*** and reread the gist they recorded for chapter 1.

- Read aloud the selected excerpt, using **Text Guide: *The Lightning Thief*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. As you read, students follow along, reading silently. Note that while students may read in small groups or individually in future lessons, students will benefit from this initial introduction to the text as a whole class.

- Excerpt: Chapter 2, starting at page 16 “I was used to the occasional weird experience . . . ” and ending at page 21 “ . . . They thought I was in some kind of danger.”

- During reading, invite students to add any unfamiliar words to their vocabulary logs. Add any new words to the academic word wall and **domain-specific word wall** as applicable, and invite students to add translations in native languages.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What is the gist? What is this chapter mostly about?” Refer to the **Gist Record: *The Lightning Thief*** **anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** for guidance. (Responses will vary, but may include: Percy hears Mr. Brunner and Grover talking about him in secret; Percy is expelled from Yancy Academy; Percy sees three old ladies snip a cord of yarn.)

- Invite a student to paraphrase the key points in more comprehensible language for those who need heavier support. ▲

- Model recording gist (key words, not full sentences) on a **sticky note**, and invite students to do the same, sticking them at the front of the chapter for quick reference.

- Use the **Synopsis: *The Lightning Thief***, **Chapter 2** as needed to review and note key details for the entire chapter.

- Give students 1 minute to silently reflect on the text. Encourage them to consider how the chapter made them feel. They can write or sketch, or just sit and think.

- Direct students’ attention to the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**, and review respect, compassion, and empathy as needed before inviting students to share their reflections if they choose.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time A, prepare sticky notes with written words or drawings based on the gist of different sections of the text. Students can match the gist represented on the sticky notes with each section of the text.

Work Time

B. Analyze Point of View: *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 1 – RL.6.6 (15 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can explain Percy’s point of view toward Mr. Brunner in chapter 1 of *The Lightning Thief*.”

- Turn and Talk:

“What do you already know about the term *point of view*?” (Student responses will vary, but may include what was discussed and posted on the word wall during Opening A: the narrator’s position in relation to the story being told. It shows the opinions or feelings of the characters involved in a situation. Point of view is the way the author allows the reader to “hear” and “see” what is happening.)

- Draw students’ attention to the posted **Point of View anchor chart**, and invite students to choral read the definition together.

- Allow students to share any previous knowledge or familiarity with point of view. Update correct definitions or examples on the anchor chart. Use misconceptions to guide further instruction.

- See **Point of View anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**.

- Invite students to turn to page 2 and to read along silently. Read aloud the excerpt beginning at, “But Mr. Brunner, our Latin teacher, was leading this trip, so I had hopes” and ending at “ . . . I wouldn’t get in trouble.”

- Turn and Talk:

“From what point of view is this novel is written? How do you know?” (first person, because the narrator says ‘I’)

“Who is the narrator? Who is talking? How do you know?” (Percy, because he tells the story from his point of view)

- Display and distribute **QuickWrite: Point of View: *The Lightning Thief***, **Chapter 1** and invite students to read the directions and prompt aloud chorally:

“From reading this excerpt, what is Percy’s point of view toward Mr. Brunner?”

- Using the directions on the student handout, ensure students understand the parameters of a QuickWrite. Invite them to work in pairs on their QuickWrite, and tell students that this is a first attempt at answering a question like this, so they don’t need to worry about getting everything right; this exercise is to see what they notice.

- Circulate to monitor and guide students. Pay attention to common misconceptions, and take note of a student who has composed an exemplary response.

- After 5 minutes, invite students to share out their ideas with the whole group. Refer to the **QuickWrite: Point of View: *The Lightning Thief***, **Chapter 1 (example for teacher reference)**.

- Direct students to make one edit to their QuickWrite based on the discussion (e.g., adding more text evidence, removing irrelevant information).

For Lighter Support

- The amount of new information regarding point of view may be overwhelming to some ELLs. Teach them to use active reading strategies to better locate important information in the Point of View anchor chart of Work Time B. These strategies may include:

- Highlighting key words

- Representing or summarizing key ideas in the margins using words or drawings

- Repurposing or reorganizing the information into a small chart or graphic organizer

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time B, teach students to use active reading strategies to better understand the information in the chart. These strategies may include:

- Underlining or circling unknown words

- Writing short questions (or simply question marks next to parts that seem unclear)

- Adding translations of key words in the margin

Closing and Assessment

A. Reflect on Learning Targets (5 minutes)

- Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the learning targets, using a checking for understanding technique—for example, Thumb-O-Meter—for each. Scan student responses, and make a note of students who might need support. Check in with them moving forward.

Homework

A. Determine Unfamiliar Vocabulary

- Students complete **Homework: Unfamiliar Vocabulary: *The Lightning Thief***, **Chapter 2**.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students should preread chapter 3 in *The Lightning Thief* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.
