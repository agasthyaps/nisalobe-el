Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- L.4.1f – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they correct a fragment from *The Lightning Thief* and turn it into a complete sentence. This builds on the activity in Lesson 9. Students briefly review this activity during Work Time B before they complete the text-dependent questions.

- RL.6.1 – Work Time A: Students complete day 2 of a two-day Language Dive (day 1 occurs as part of Lesson 9), using evidence to support their analysis of what the sentence says. See the Tools Page (http://eled.org/tools) for additional information regarding a consistent Language Dive routine. Students then apply their understanding of word connotations to chapter 8 for homework, through both open-ended and selected response questions. Please refer to Homework: Lesson 10: Language Dive Practice: Word Connotation: *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 8 (answers for teacher reference).

- L.6.4 – Work Time A: During the Language Dive, students apply strategies to determine the meanings of unknown words in a sentence from *The Lightning Thief*.

- L.6.5 – Work Time A: During the Language Dive, students analyze connotations and denotations of the words *sullen* and *depressed*.

- RL.6.1 – Work Time B: Students read the next chapter of the text and find the gist. Students also unpack unfamiliar vocabulary and answer comprehension questions using inferences and evidence from text.

- RL.6.3 – Work Time B: After students finish reading, they are invited to discuss the challenges that Percy faced in chapter 8, describe his responses to those challenges, and speculate about connections between his actions and his character. Students then revisit these comments during Closing and Assessment A.

- RL.6.4 – Closing and Assessment A: Students respond to a QuickWrite prompt and analyze the impact of the author’s word choice on the meaning of the text.

- RL.6.6 – Closing and Assessment A: Students respond to a QuickWrite prompt and explain how the author develops Percy’s point of view toward Mr. Brunner (Chiron).

- In this lesson, students continue to focus on becoming ethical people by exhibiting empathy and respect for their classmates as they work together and for their classmates’ responses to the reading.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Build on students’ understanding of connotation by also introducing the term *denotation*. Examine advertisements and song lyrics, and label the connotation of words (positive, negative, or neutral). Discuss why the authors chose those words and what effect the connotation has on eliciting a particular emotion from the audience.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students have closely read through chapter 7 of *The Lightning Thief*, found the gist, determined the meanings of unfamiliar words and phrases, and analyzed point of view and language use. In this lesson, students continue to read from the novel and expand their thinking about point of view toward Mr. Brunner/Chiron and language use as well as how Percy has responded to challenges, in preparation for the Mid-Unit 1 and End of Unit 1 Assessments.

Support All Students

- Note there is a differentiated version of QuickWrite: Point of View: *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 8 used in Closing and Assessment A in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- As before, continue to be mindful about issues and characterizations that may be sensitive for students or with which some students may connect personally or deeply. In addition to the issues that have been noted previously, there is another mention of nymphs running from heartsick gods which has some suggestion of unwanted advances or sexual harassment.

- After reading this chapter of the text for the gist, ensure that students have time to reflect. Monitor students and determine if there are issues surfacing that need to be discussed in more detail as a whole group, in smaller groups, or independently. Be aware that reflections may be personal, and students are not required to share them.

- Students may need additional support with the reading of the chapter. As during previous lessons in which reading takes place, provide students with a number of options for reading (small group, pairs, individual), sometimes allowing them to decide and sometimes deciding for them, taking into account their strengths, needs, and interests and grouping deliberately as needed. ▲ No matter what options are chosen, also be mindful about variety, being sure to change the routine to maintain engagement and to support students effectively.

- Students may need additional support with determining the gist, working through unfamiliar vocabulary, and answering text-dependent questions. Again, use thoughtful pairing, and consider which groups might need more constant support. ▲

- Students who would benefit from fluency practice should be encouraged and supported during Work Time B to read with a partner or small group. ▲

- To support ELLs, in this lesson students complete a Language Dive that targets their understanding of connotation and denotation. This lesson also features an agenda with familiar activities to reduce ambiguity and improve students’ confidence.

- ELLs may find it challenging to learn connotations, which are mostly acquired through exposure and frequency. It may be difficult to explain why a word has a particular connotation beyond pointing out that some words sound more “right” than others. Encourage students to commit new connotations to memory, and remind them that learning connotations can be a long process.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.B.6a, 6.I.B.8, and 6.II.A.1.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ QuickWrites as they work to identify common issues with identifying point of view and how it is developed. Use these common issues as teaching points in the whole group share-out.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students continue in their anchor text, reading from chapter 9 for gist and unfamiliar vocabulary and then completing the mid-unit assessment.

- For the rest of Unit 1, students continue to read excerpts from chapters of *The Lightning Thief*, determining gist, recording unfamiliar vocabulary, and continuing to examine point of view and use of language. During Unit 2, students read Greek stories introduced in the novel and view clips from the film version of *The Lightning Thief* to compare the experience of reading versus viewing the story.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.4.1f (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 10**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

- If productive, to illustrate the meaning of *connotation*, provide examples of words with similar denotations and distinct connotations (e.g., *home* vs. *residence*; *lazy* vs. *laid-back*; *confident* vs. *arrogant*). ▲

Work Time

A. Language Dive: *The Lightning Thief*, Page 96 – L.6.5c (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can use differences among word connotations to determine meaning in *The Lightning Thief*.”

- Tell students they will now participate in day 2 of a two-day a Language Dive to examine how differences among word connotations help us determine meaning.

- Reread aloud page 96 of ***The Lightning Thief***.

- Focus students on the sentence:

“I thought about some of the kids I’d seen in the Hermes cabin, teenagers who looked sullen and depressed, as if they were waiting for a call that would never come” (96).

- Use the **Language Dive Guide: *The Lightning Thief***, **Page 96 (for teacher reference)** and the **Language Dive: *The Lightning Thief***, **Page 96 sentence chunk strips** to guide students through day 2 of the Language Dive conversation about the sentence. Display and ask students to retrieve their copies the **Language Dive: *The Lightning Thief***, **Page 96 note-catcher**.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- The supports in this lesson are similar to the supports in Lesson 9, as the tasks and/or focus of these lessons are similar. Based on student performance in Lesson 9, release students from some of the supports applied in those lessons to foster independence and to assess student progress.

- Prior to Work Time A, invite a more proficient student to recall and report the focus and findings of the previous lesson’s Language Dive.

For Heavier Support

- To support student comprehension of the Language Dive, provide students with examples of uses of the focus vocabulary *sullen* and *depressed* in other contexts.

Work Time

B. Read *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 8 Excerpt – RL.6.3 (20 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Read aloud the selected excerpt, using **Text Guide: *The Lightning Thief*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Refer to the following resources as appropriate to support this section of the lesson: **Gist Record: *The Lightning Thief*** **anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**, **vocabulary logs**, **chapter synopsis**, and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Excerpt: Starting at page 107 “The next few days I settled into a routine that felt almost normal . . . ” and ending at page 109 “ . . . Why couldn’t my dad, whoever he was, make a phone appear?”; and starting at page 119 “It was a warm, sticky night . . . ” and ending at page 126 “ . . . Son of the Sea-God.”

- Gist: During a camp-wide game of Capture the Flag, Percy gets attacked by a dog, then the water heals him.

- Tell students to think about the challenge Percy faces in this chapter, and his response to that challenge.

- Ask:

“What challenge does Percy face in chapter 8?” (playing capture the flag; being attacked by a hellhound; being claimed by his father, Poseidon)

“What is his response to that challenge?” (Percy gets upset that he seems to have a small role in capture the flag. When confronted by Clarisse and the other Ares kids, he tries but isn’t very successful in fending them off, and, in fact, gets injured. But again, by surprise, he is able to best Clarisse, which enables his team to win. Percy doesn’t have time to respond when the hound attacks, so he is bitten. Percy is stunned when he is claimed by his father and everyone bows.)

“What might that reveal about this character?” (Percy wants to feel like he was being a useful part of the team, but he doesn’t fully trust his fellow campers, even Annabeth. Percy is seemingly at the mercy of the creatures and events at Camp Half-Blood. Percy still doesn’t fully believe the magnitude of what’s happened and who his father is. He is feeling overwhelmed and still confused.)

“In what ways did the characters demonstrate or not demonstrate a habit of character in this chapter?” (The teams demonstrate collaboration when they work together to capture the flag.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Closing and Assessment

A. QuickWrite: Point of View: *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 8 – RL.6.6 (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can explain how the author develops Percy’s point of view toward Mr. Brunner in *The Lightning Thief*.”

- Refocus the whole group.

- Distribute and display **QuickWrite: Point of View: *The Lightning Thief***, **Chapter 8** or **QuickWrite: Point of View: *The Lightning Thief***, **Chapter 8** ▲. Read aloud the prompt, and remind students to write whatever comes into their heads in response to the prompt.

- Remind students that whenever they write a sentence, it must contain a subject and a predicate and express a complete thought. Tell students to keep this in mind as they write their QuickWrites.

- Circulate to support students as they write.

- See **QuickWrite: Point of View: *The Lightning Thief***, **Chapter 8 (example for teacher reference)**.

- After 5 minutes, refocus the whole group. Select students to share with the whole group. As students share, update the **Point of View anchor chart**. See **Point of View anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- If a clear error recurs in students’ QuickWrites, show students a few examples of the error in context. Allow them to hone their attention to error by working in pairs to locate the error and brainstorm how it could be fixed.

For Heavier Support

N/A

Homework

A. Analyze Connotation

- Students complete **Homework: Language Dive Practice: Connotation: *The Lightning Thief***, **Chapter 8**.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students should preread chapter 9 of *The Lightning Thief* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.
