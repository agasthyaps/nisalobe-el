**Directions:** Answer the following questions, using evidence from the text to support your ideas.

1.  Carefully read these two sentences:

“Instantly, I felt better. Strength **surged** back into my arms. The sword didn’t feel so awkward” (110).

Instantly, I felt better. Strength **returned** back into my arms. The sword didn’t feel so awkward.

The words in bold have very similar meanings. How does the author’s choice to use the word **surged** affect the reader’s understanding of the first sentence? (RL.6.4, L.6.5c)

2.  It implies that the strength in Percy’s arms came back like an ocean wave.

3.  It emphasizes that the strength in Percy’s arms came back quickly.

4.  It implies that the strength in Percy’s arms came back like a trickling faucet.

5.  It emphasizes that the strength in Percy’s arms came back unexpectedly.

6.  Carefully read these two sets of sentences:

“Grover had scampered to the top like a mountain goat, but the lava had almost gotten me. My shirt had smoking holes in it. The hairs had been **singed** off my forearms” (111).

Grover had scampered to the top like a mountain goat, but the lava had almost gotten me. My shirt had smoking holes in it. The hairs had been **burned** off my forearms.

The words in bold have very similar meanings. How does the author’s choice to use the word **singed** affect our understanding of the first set of sentences? (RL.6.4, L.6.5c)

7.  It implies that the lava caused Percy serious injury.

8.  It emphasizes that the lava started a dangerous fire.

9.  It implies that the lava slowly melted Percy’s clothing and hair.
