Sample student response: Percy’s respect for Chiron has deepened since chapter 6.  
The author develops Percy’s point of view toward Chiron in chapter 7 by having Chiron save his life and showing Percy’s reaction to this event. He uses words and phrases like, “cascade of thwacking sounds, like forty pieces of paper being ripped one after the other,” “by some miracle,” and “turned me into a hundred pounds of delicatessen meat” to illustrate the risk that Chiron took to save Percy. This action demonstrates how Chiron feels about Percy. When Percy realizes that Chiron cares for him, his point of view changes again because previously Percy was convinced that Mr. Brunner (Chiron) had lost faith in him.
