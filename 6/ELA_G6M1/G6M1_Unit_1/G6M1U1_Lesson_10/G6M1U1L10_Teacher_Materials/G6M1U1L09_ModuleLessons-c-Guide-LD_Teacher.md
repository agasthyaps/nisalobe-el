(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

“I thought about some of the kids I’d seen in the Hermes cabin, teenagers who looked sullen and depressed, **as if** they were waiting for a call that would never come.” (from page 96 of *The Lightning Thief* by Rick Riordan)

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps to address the daily learning target and L.6.5b and L.6.5c by inviting students to analyze relationships among words and determine the connotations of words in a sentence.

- Supporting Standards: RL.6.1, RL.6.4, L.6.4, SL.6.1.

- Guiding Question: The sentence helps students respond to the guiding question (**Why have stories from Greek mythology remained popular?**) by illustrating that mythological figures can be presented as relatable characters, making them feel more relevant to contemporary readers.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses the conjunction **as if** to introduce a simile and features rich vocabulary and synonyms. Invite students to discuss each chunk briefly, but encourage extended conversation and practice with the focus structure: as if.

- Practice and Transfer: After discussing the focus structure, students practice using it to discuss something in their lives. Students transfer their understanding of the meaning and structure of this sentence when analyzing relationships across words and ideas in *The Lightning Thief* and during the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment.

- Delivery: The chunks are presented out of order to provide context for the reason presented in the final chunk, allowing for better understanding and discussion. This Language Dive should be delivered over two days in Lessons 9 and 10. Day 1 will focus on the phrase **as if**, and day 2 will focus on determining the connotations of words with similar denotations.

**Time**

Allocate 10 minutes for Day 1 and 15 minutes for Day 2.

Throughout the Language Dive

Encourage rich conversation among students about the meaning of each of the sentence chunk strips, what the academic phrases within each chunk mean, and how they relate to the sentence and the text overall. Monitor and guide conversation with total participation techniques and Conversation Cues.

After asking questions, provide students up to 1 minute of think time to reflect, depending on the complexity of the question. Alternatively, invite partners to discuss, providing an allocated time for each student.

Record and display students’ responses next to or underneath the target language for visual reference.

Although students should briefly discuss all chunks in each Language Dive sentence, invite them to slow down during one chunk, called the focus structure, to investigate and practice a particularly compelling language structure.

Where possible, consider placing sketches, pictures, or illustrations above key nouns and verbs in the chunks after discussing their meanings. This allows students to quickly access the content of each chunk as they work with the structures in the sentence as a whole.

For translation work, invite students to use their online or paper translation dictionary if necessary. Invite students to add new vocabulary to their vocabulary logs.

Note: Some responses to questions in the Language Dive indicate only that “Responses will vary.” “Responses will vary” is intended to suggest that students should be encouraged to grapple with questions and ideas, develop interest and participation, and not be immediately steered toward “correct” responses. Indeed, even where correct responses are provided, consider continuing to invite a culture of inquiry and grappling.

**Key**

Launch

- Welcome students to their second Grade 6 Language Dive. Display the term **Language Dive**.

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partner. Ask:

“Based on your first Language Dive, what do you think a Language Dive is?” (Responses will vary.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- If productive, cue students to clarify the conversation by confirming what they mean. If necessary, prompt students’ responses with sentence frames: “Yes, you’ve got it” or “No, sorry, that’s not what I mean. What I mean is \_\_\_\_\_.” Ask:

“So, do you mean \_\_\_\_\_?” (Responses will vary.)

- Confirm or amend, and display students’ ideas.

Deconstruct

- Remind students about the first step in the Deconstruct stage:

“When we do a Language Dive, first we read the sentence. We talk about what we think it means and how it might help us understand our guiding question.”

- Invite students to put their finger by this sentence from *The Lightning Thief* on their note-catchers: **“I thought about some of the kids I’d seen in the Hermes cabin, teenagers who looked sullen and depressed, <u>as if</u> they were waiting for a call that would never come.”**

- Read aloud the sentence twice, and then ask students to take turns reading the sentence aloud with their partners.

- Ask:

“What does this sentence mean to you?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“How does this sentence add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

they were waiting for a call that would never come.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following sentence chunk strip: **they were waiting for a call that would never come.**

- Ask:

“This is the first chunk we are going to analyze. But is this where the sentence begins?” (No, this is the last part of the sentence.)

“Why do you think we are starting with the last chunk first?” (Responses will vary, but may include: because it helps our understanding, because it reduces distractions, because it is more challenging/interesting.)

“Look at the full sentence on your note-catcher. Who are ‘they’ in this chunk? What group of people is this chunk referring to?” (the kids/teenagers in the Hermes cabin)

- Ask:

“What do you think it feels like to wait for a call that will never come?” (Responses will vary, but may include: it feels sad, lonely, disappointing.)

- Remind students that movement and acting out can help them figure out the meanings of the sentences and chunks.

- Ask:

“Can you show me with your face and body how it looks to be waiting for a call that would never come?” (Responses will vary, but look for students to show expressions and movements that demonstrate disappointment, impatience, or sadness.)

- If students wish, they may also draw a quick sketch on their note-catchers that shows someone **waiting for a call that would never come**. 🖉

- Say:

“Let’s talk about the second chunk.”

as if

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **as if**

- Place this sentence strip just above the sentence strip of the previous chunk (**they were waiting for a call that would never come**), so students can see this part of the sentence in its entirety.

- Remind students that highlighting language can help them notice important structures and patterns.

- Underline as if in blue, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 🖉

- Ask:

“What does as if mean? What does it do in a sentence?” (introduces a simile, allows the writer to imagine more about how something looks or seems, shows a comparison)

“If the writer used as if, does it mean that the teenagers are actually waiting for a call? What are they waiting for?” (It’s not an actual call; it’s just some sort of sign or message; they are waiting for their god parents to claim them.)

- Point out that as if is a good structure for adding figurative language. Authors can use **as if** to introduce a creative comparison or simile.

- Remind students that considering synonyms (words that mean the same thing) can help them learn new words and structures. Ask:

“Can you think of other words or phrases that mean the same thing as as if?” (like; as though).

“What if we replaced the phrase as if with the word like? Would the meaning of the sentence change much?” (No, the meaning stays the same.)

“If they mean the same thing, why do you think the authors used the phrase as if instead of the word like?” (Responses will vary, but may include: because as if is more formal, more academic, more literary.)

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Tell students they will now practice the focus structure:

“You’ve played with this chunk and figured out the meaning. Now let’s use the structure in the sentence for our own speaking and writing.”

- Draw students’ attention to the three sentence frames on their note-catchers.

1.  Clarisse stared at me angrily, **as if** she \_\_\_\_\_.

2.  Annabeth \_\_\_\_\_, **as if** she had just looked into the eyes of a monster.

3.  Percy \_\_\_\_\_ **as if** \_\_\_\_\_.

- Point out that each sentence uses **as if** to connect different parts of a sentence. Explain that **as if** is a phrase that shows relationships across words and ideas (the relationship being a description, and a creative simile for that description).

- Say:

“Each of these sentence frames includes the phrase as if. This phrase will introduce a simile. In sentence 1, you can practice writing a simile. In sentence 2, you can practice interpreting a simile by describing what is happening in real life. In sentence 3, you can practice both parts. You have 2 minutes. In that time, you can choose to complete one, two, or all three of the sentences.” 🖉

- Remind students that using **as if** allows us to imagine and write about things that may not be real. Encourage creativity.

- After 2 minutes, invite responses, and write and display students’ ideas.

- Say:

“You did well figuring out what the first chunk means, and why it’s important. Tomorrow, we will dive into the other two chunks and then put the whole sentence back together.”

Launch Day 2

- Tell students this Language Dive is day 2 of a two-part Language Dive.

- Invite students to choral read the sentence from *The Lightning Thief* on their note-catcher: **I thought about some of the kids I’d seen in the Hermes cabin, teenagers who looked sullen and depressed, as if they were waiting for a call that would never come.**

- Say:

“You did well last time figuring out what the first two chunks mean, and why they’re important. Let’s talk about the third chunk.”

I thought about some of the kids I’d seen in the Hermes cabin,

Deconstruct

- Welcome students to day 2 of the second Grade 6 Language Dive. Remind them that today they will continue diving into the sentence whose two chunks they saw in the previous lesson.

- Say/ask:

“In our last lesson, we looked at two chunks of this sentence. Without looking at your note-catchers, work with your partner or triad to try to recreate the chunks we looked at last time. Can you remember them word for word?” (as if and they were waiting for a call that would never come)

- Display the following chunk, and read along with students: **I thought about some of the kids I’d seen in the Hermes cabin,**

- Ask:

“What does this chunk tell us?” (This chunk tells us what Percy is thinking about; it tells us to think about the kids in the Hermes cabin.)

- After inviting responses, consider writing and displaying students’ ideas.

- Say:

“Let’s talk about the fourth and final chunk.”

teenagers who looked sullen and depressed,

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **teenagers who looked sullen and depressed,**

- Ask students to open their copies of *The Lightning Thief* and put their finger on the Language Dive sentence on page 96 (about halfway down the page). Encourage students to assist one another in locating the sentence. Invite a volunteer to read aloud the short paragraph that comes before the Language Dive sentence: **“Annabeth ran her palm along the rail. ‘The gods are busy. They have a lot of kids and they don’t always . . . Well, sometimes they don’t care about us, Percy. They ignore us.’”**

- Say:

“Based on our Language Dive sentence, and the paragraph that comes before it, what do we know about these teenagers?” (They live in the Hermes cabin; they are the children of Hermes; the gods are busy and sometimes ignore their kids.)

- Underline sullen and depressed in red, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 🖉

- Ask:

“Does anyone know what depressed means?” (Responses will vary, but should include: sad, upset, low.)

“What about the word sullen? Does anyone know what this word means?” (Responses will vary, but should be similar to responses for depressed.)

- If students do not know what the word **sullen** means, say/ask:

“We know that depressed here means sad. It is a negative emotion. We also know that the teenagers look both depressed and sullen at the same time. Does this mean that sullen is a positive emotion, or another negative emotion, like depressed? (negative emotion; one cannot be both happy and sad at the same time.)

- Continue by saying:

“Sullen and depressed are synonyms, which means they have basically the same meaning.”

- Tell students that even synonyms have small differences in their meaning or in how they are used. Draw students’ attention to the two definitions on their note-catchers.

1.  **sullen** (adjective): describes a sad or angry person who does not want to talk or smile

2.  **depressed** (adjective): describes a very sad person

- Using a Conversation Cue to allow time to think and process language internally, say/ask:

“I’ll give you time to think about this with a partner. Talk with your partner about these two definitions. Do you think these words are exactly the same, or are they a little bit different? How are they different? You have 1 minute.” (Responses will vary, but may include: depressed is stronger; sullen can also mean angry; sullen may be more temporary or may affect one’s actions and behaviors.)

- Give students the option of sketching drawings on their note-catchers that show differences between the words **sullen** and **depressed**. 🖉

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- If productive, cue students to clarify their sentences by confirming what they mean: “So, do you mean \_\_\_\_\_?” (Responses will vary. Ensure that students are using the structure meaningfully.)

- Ask:

“If both of these words mean something like sad, why do you think the author didn’t just say ‘sad’ instead?” (Responses will vary, but may include: these words are stronger, they’re more precise/academic/formal.)

- Tell students that similar words may have different connotations. This means that they make someone feel or think of different things, even if the words have essentially the same meaning.

I thought about some of the kids I’d seen in the Hermes cabin, teenagers who looked sullen and depressed, as if they were waiting for a call that would never come.

Reconstruct

- Say:

“You did well figuring out what all of the chunks mean, and why they’re important.”

- Remind students they will now go from the Deconstruct to the Reconstruct stage:

“Now that you’ve played with the chunks, let’s put them all back together again into a sentence. And let’s see how playing with the chunks adds to our understanding of the meaning of the sentence and our guiding question. Let’s see how reconstructing helps us understand how English works.”

- Point to and read the entire sentence on display: **I thought about some of the kids I’d seen in the Hermes cabin, teenagers who looked sullen and depressed, <u>as if</u> they were waiting for a call that would never come.**

- Ask:

“What is the noun in this subject? What is the verb in this predicate?” (I; thought about some of the kids I’d seen in the Hermes cabin . . .)

“Why did the author add on to this predicate? How did they do it?” (The writer wanted to combine many ideas into one sentence. He used a series of phrases.)

“What if we remove this long predicate?” Experiment with removing the red chunks and rereading the sentence aloud: “I.” (It doesn’t make sense. The subject, everyone, isn’t doing anything. It needs the predicate.)

- Draw students’ attention to the chunks **I thought about some of the kids I’d seen in the Hermes cabin, and teenagers who looked sullen and depressed.** Ask:

“In these two chunks, are the words kids and teenagers referring to the same people, or different people? How do you know?” (same people)

“Why does the writer talk about the same group of people twice?” (to give more information about them)

- Draw students’ attention to the commas around the chunk **teenagers who looked sullen and depressed,** and point out that commas sometimes allow us to add short clauses that give more information about what we are writing about.

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- Ask:

“What other questions can we ask that will help us understand this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question, Why have stories from Greek mythology remained popular? (Responses will vary, but may be connected to the big idea that mythological stories remain relatable because they can be reimagined to fit different environments and time periods.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

Practice

- Say:

“You did well putting the chunks back together again and talking about how this Language Dive has added your understanding of the meaning of the sentence and the guiding question.”

- Remind students they will now go from the Reconstruct to the Practice stage: “You’ve played with the sentence and figured out the meaning. Now let’s start to use the language in the sentence for our own speaking and writing.”

- Draw students’ attention to the sentence frame on their note-catchers:

“The \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ looked \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, as if \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.”

noun phrase adjective adjective with a similar meaning simile

- Say:

“Use this frame to write a sentence in your own words with your triad.” 🖉

- If productive, cue students to clarify their sentences by confirming what they mean: “So, do you mean \_\_\_\_\_?” (Responses will vary. Ensure that students are using the structure meaningfully.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- Congratulate students on completing the Language Dive to better understand the meaning of this sentence, how it connects to the guiding question, and how to use it in their own speaking and writing.
