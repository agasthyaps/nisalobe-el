Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- L.6.4b – Opening A: Students are introduced to affixes through an entrance ticket. They use an affix list to help them deconstruct words from *The Lightning Thief* into smaller pieces (i.e., their prefixes, roots, and suffixes).

- RI.6.1 – Work Time B: Students build knowledge of Greek mythology and its relevance today by closely reading an informational text, “Why Ancient Greek Mythology Is Still Relevant Today,” and using textual evidence to support their analysis of the text. The Close Reading Guide lists the text excerpts, key questions to ask students, and instructional moves required. Continue to use discussion protocols (e.g., Think-Pair-Share, Conversation Cues, and total participation techniques) to engage all students in a collaborative discussion about the text. These close, attentive reading activities help students gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of the specific text, build word knowledge, build analytical reading skills, and foster perseverance and passion for deep reading of worthy texts.

- RI.6.2 – Work Time B: During the close read, students determine the central idea of the text and locate details that support the main idea(s) of each section of the text.

- RI.6.4 – Work Time B: During the close read, students determine the meanings of words and phrases as they are used in the informational text.

- L.6.4 – Work Time C: Students dig into a sentence from “Why Ancient Greek Mythology Is Still Relevant Today” through a Language Dive to determine the meanings of unknown words. They practice using a variety of strategies, including deriving meaning from context, breaking down a word into its root and affixes, and making preliminary determinations about a word’s meaning and then using a dictionary to verify their understanding of the word. A Language Dive empowers students to analyze, understand, and use the language of academic sentences, which often seems opaque to students. During a Language Dive, slow down for 10 minutes to have a conversation about the meaning, purpose, and structure of a compelling sentence from a complex text, or from a learning target, checklist, or rubric included in the curriculum. Following the engaging deconstruct-reconstruct-practice routine of the Language Dive, students play with the smallest “chunks” of the sentence, interpreting them, rearranging them, or using them to talk about their own lives. In this lesson, students focus on working to become effective learners by collaborating as they work in triads throughout the lesson.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Provide additional practice with the affix list, giving other words with common affixes for students to “translate.”

- The article used in the close read offers a strong and simple vehicle for introducing counter arguments, a technique used extensively throughout the piece to develop the central idea. Invite students to discuss the following questions with a partner or respond briefly in writing: *What is the author’s point of view about Greek myths? Support your response with a quote from the text. What does the author assume the reader’s point of view will be? What makes you think so? Support your response with quotes from the text. How does the author use the concerns a reader may have about reading Greek myths to develop the central idea of this article?* Invite students to find more specific examples of the influence of Greek mythology on North American culture than are referenced in the informational text or the novel.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lessons, students read from the first few chapters of the anchor text, *The Lightning Thief*. By engaging in a close read and a Language Dive of an informational text, students strengthen their critical thinking skills and better understand the purpose for reading *The Lightning Thief* and its relevance today.

Support All Students

- Note there is a differentiated version of the Close Read note-catcher used in Work Time B in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- During practice with affixes, put common base words and affixes on index cards; allow students to “build” words by manipulating the different word parts. ▲

- Students may find it challenging to complete the complex close read in the amount of time allotted. Focus on fewer sections. ▲

- Gather students who might need additional support during the close read in one place in the room to support them quickly and quietly as they closely read the text. ▲

- Students may need additional support with recording their answers on their note-catchers. Sit those students in a group together to support when necessary. ▲

- Display a world map and point out the location of Greece, the origin of Greek myths.

- This lesson supports ELLs by introducing an **affix list** that students can use to break down and interpret unknown vocabulary and by leading students through a close read of an informational text, which will help ELLs better understand how central ideas are developed in texts. The close read includes a gradual release of scaffolds across its three sections, increasing students’ independence in a supported way. Additionally, this lesson features the first Language Dive of Unit 1, which will hone ELLs’ attention to the structure, vocabulary, and content of a sentence selected from their informational text.

- ELLs may find it challenging to apply skills developed through the Language Dive to other texts that they read independently. To make metacognitive strategies transparent and to empower students to take leadership of their learning, invite them to respond to questions such as, “How did this help us learn new language?”, “How did you figure out what that word meant?”, and “What was useful for you in the discussion?” In addition, recognize that word formation can vary widely across languages; thus, the concept of affixes that change word form or meaning may be very new to some ELLs. Be sensitive to the extra time it may take to grasp the concepts of affixes, and, if possible, make additional resources available for student reference and support. Consider discussing how English affixes compare with students’ home language affixes.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.B.6a, 6.I.B.6c, and 6.II.A.1.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Close Reading note-catchers to ensure students understand how to determine a central idea.

- Review students’ Language Dive note-catcher to ensure students understand the strategies introduced in the Language Dive for interpreting unknown vocabulary. Also, make sure that students are effectively and correctly using the new vocabulary introduced in the Language Dive (e.g., *follies, hubris*) to complete the sentence frame of the Practice section and reflect on the guiding question, *What makes a myth?*

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students continue in their anchor text, reading from chapter 4 of *The Lightning Thief*, and continue to practice naming gist, identifying unfamiliar words, and examining point of view. Students also launch their independent research reading, so prepare these materials in advance.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.6.4b (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 5**. Distribute **affix lists** for reference.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“Using the breakdown of the word, what would you say the meaning of *mythology* is, in your own words?” (Student responses will vary, but may include the study of traditional stories.)

“What other words can you think of that contain *-ology*?” (Student responses will vary, but may include *biology*.)

“How might knowing the meanings of affixes and roots like *-ology* help you determine the meanings of other words?” (Now that we know *-ology* means the science or study of, we know any words ending in *-ology* mean science or study of.)

- Ensure this strategy is represented with the vocabulary strategies on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart**, and add any specific detail.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

- Visually present the word as *information + -al*, in order to help ELLs notice the affix. ▲

- With students, use the vocabulary strategies on the Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart to deconstruct the words *central idea* (the main point the author wants the reader to take away from reading the text) in the first learning target, and *summarize* (give a short and comprehensive statement of what has been previously stated) in the second learning target. Record on the **academic word wall** with translations in home languages, where appropriate ▲, and invite students to record words in their **vocabulary logs**.

For Lighter Support

- Provide students with opportunities for additional affix practice that raise their linguistic awareness, such as a worksheet that asks students to separate affixes into two categories: those that change meaning (e.g., *un-*, *a-*, *bi-*) and those that change part of speech (e.g., *-ism*, *-al*, *-ion*).

For Heavier Support

- As students consider the affixes and roots within the word *mythology*, invite them to reflect on word-formation patterns in their home languages. Do their home languages have prefixes and suffixes? How similar are they to the new affixes they are learning in English?

Work Time

A. Construct Anchor Charts (5 minutes)

- Focus students on the Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart, and ask:

“When reading the novel, what routines have we been following to help us better understand the text?” (Student responses will vary, but may include: finding the gist, determining the meaning of unfamiliar vocabulary, analyzing text in response to questions.)

- Update the Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart with student responses. See **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**.

- Direct students’ attention to the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**. Explain that it says at the top that effective learners are people who develop the mindsets and skills for success in college, career, and life.

- Read aloud the habit of character recorded:

“I collaborate: This means I can work well with others to accomplish a task or goal.”

- Turn and Talk:

“What does collaboration look like? What might you see when someone is collaborating?” (See **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart** \[example for teacher reference\]).

“What does collaboration sound like? What might you hear when someone is collaborating?” (See **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart** \[example for teacher reference\].)

- As students share, record their responses in the appropriate column on the Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart.

Work Time

B. Close Read: “Why Ancient Greek Mythology Is Still Relevant Today” – RI.6.2 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can determine a central idea of an informational text and how it is conveyed through details.”

“I can summarize an informational text.”

- Use the **Close Reading Guide: “Why Ancient Greek Mythology Is Still Relevant Today” (for teacher reference)** to set the purpose of the close read and to guide students through a close read of this excerpt. Refer to the guide for how to integrate the **Close Read note-catcher: “Why Ancient Greek Mythology Is Still Relevant Today”** or **Close Read note-catcher: “Why Ancient Greek Mythology Is Still Relevant Today” note-catcher**. ▲ Refer to **Close Read note-catcher: “Why Ancient Greek Mythology Is Still Relevant Today” (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- After the close read, focus students on the Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart again, and ask:

“When reading this text, what did we do to help us better understand the text?” (Student responses will vary, but may include: rereading the text, digging into it more deeply through questions paragraph by paragraph.)

- Update the Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart with student responses. See Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart (example for teacher reference).

- Congratulate students on their hard work persevering through the close read.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- For Work Time B, create a graphic organizer that invites students to explore discourse connections between the informational text and *The Lightning Thief* (e.g., differences in introductions of each text).

- To support students as they identify connections between the informational text and *The Lightning Thief,* give ELLs a short list of specific questions to answer with evidence from the text (e.g., *Which text has more figurative language? Which text has characters and a narrator? Which text describes the real world?*).

For Heavier Support

- If students struggle to generate immediate answers to the questions of the close read, group students into pairs or triads and assign each group two to three discussion questions. Then, regroup students to report their answers to one another. This will give students more time to examine and interpret the text and develop their responses.

- Copy selections from *The Lightning Thief* and the informational text of the close read, and display them side by side. Invite students to draw lines to show similarities in the language of the texts. Invite them to use contrasting colors to underline portions that are different. Invite students to use this resource when completing the QuickWrite of the following lesson, which asks them to identify connections across the texts.

Work Time

C. Language Dive: “Why Ancient Greek Mythology Is Still Relevant Today,” Paragraph 10 – L.6.4 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can determine the meaning of unfamiliar words and phrases in a text.”

- Tell students they will now participate in a Language Dive to improve their abilities to read closely, break down sentences, and learn new vocabulary words.

- Reread aloud paragraph 10 of **“Why Ancient Greek Mythology Is Still Relevant Today.”**

- Focus students on the sentence:

- “After all, a lot of these stories tell tales of how human follies, stupidity, and even hubris get people in trouble.”

- If productive, challenge students to generate questions about the sentence before asking the prepared questions (e.g., “What questions can we ask about this sentence? Let’s see if we can answer them together”). ▲

- Use the **Language Dive Guide: “Why Ancient Greek Mythology Is Still Relevant Today,” Paragraph 10** and the **Language Dive: “Why Ancient Greek Mythology Is Still Relevant Today,” Paragraph 10 sentence chunk strips** to guide students through a Language Dive conversation about the sentence. Distribute and display the **Language Dive: “Why Ancient Greek Mythology Is Still Relevant Today,” Paragraph 10 note-catcher**.

- See **Language Dive: “Why Ancient Greek Mythology Is Still Relevant Today,” Paragraph 10 note-catcher (example for teacher reference)**.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- For Work Time C, provide ELLs with the Language Dive sentence ahead of time. Provide guiding questions that students can consider on their own before breaking the sentence down with the class.

For Heavier Support

N/A

Closing and Assessment

A. Reflect on Academic Mindsets (5 minutes)

- Remind students that they reviewed the word *collaboration* in this lesson.

- Incorporate reflection on and awareness of the following academic mindset: “I belong in this community.”

- Turn and Talk:

“How does collaboration help you feel a sense of belonging in this classroom community?” (Possible responses: When my classmates listen to me and include me in discussions, I feel like I have a safe place in this classroom.)

“During this lesson, how did you help others to feel they belong in this community?” (Possible responses: I practiced active listening when others were speaking to show that I respected what they were saying.)

Homework

A. Connect Texts

- Students complete **Homework: QuickWrite: Connections between *The Lightning Thief*** **and “Why Ancient Greek Mythology Is Still Relevant Today.”**
