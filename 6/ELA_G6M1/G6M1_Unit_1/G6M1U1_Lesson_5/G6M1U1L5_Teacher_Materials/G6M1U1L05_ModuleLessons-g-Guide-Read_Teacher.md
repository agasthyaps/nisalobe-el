Close Reading Guide: “Why Ancient Greek Mythology Is Still Relevant Today”

(For Teacher Reference)

**Purpose and Notes**

- The purpose of this close read is for students to trace the way the author develops the central idea of the article.

- In this close read, students will focus only on selected sections of the text.

- Since this is the first experience in reading informational text this year, for the first two sections, students are given main idea and asked to identify key supporting details. This scaffold is removed in the last section.

- Although there is a lot of challenging vocabulary in this text, this close read focuses only on words needed to understand the main idea and details of each section. Support with definitions of additional words as needed for basic comprehension.

- The vocabulary questions in this close read have been designed to reinforce the strategies introduced in previous lessons. Encourage students to make these connections and to use a wide range of strategies to understand key words and phrases.

- Continue to use discussion protocols (e.g., Think-Pair-Share, Conversation Cues, and total participation techniques) to engage all students in collaborative discussion about the text.
