Language Dive Guide: “Why Ancient Greek Mythology Is Still Relevant Today,”  
Paragraph 10

L.6.4a, L.6.4b, L.6.4c, L.6.4d

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

**After all,** a lot of these stories tell tales of how human follies, stupidity, and even hubris get people in trouble. (from paragraph 10 of the informational text “Why Ancient Greek Mythology Is Still Relevant Today” by Geri Mlleff)

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence addresses the daily learning target and L.6.4a, L.6.4b, L.6.4c, and L.6.4d by allowing students to use strategies to discern the meanings of unknown words in the sentence.

- Supporting Standards: RI.6.1, RI.6.2, RI.6.4, SL.6.1.

- Guiding Question: The sentence helps students respond to the guiding question (**What is mythology?**) by discussing common themes that recur across myths.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it features academic vocabulary that may be challenging for students to interpret. Invite students to discuss each chunk briefly, but encourage extended conversation and practice with the focus structure: **after all**. Also, students will practice discerning the meaning of two unknown vocabulary items, **follies** and **hubris**, using context clues, part of speech information, and affixes before verifying with a dictionary.

- Practice and Transfer: After discussing the focus structure, students practice using it to discuss something in their lives. Students transfer their understanding of the meaning and structure of this sentence when determining meanings of unknown words in their informational and anchor texts and during the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment.

- Delivery: The chunks are presented out of order to provide context for the reason presented in the final chunk, allowing for better understanding and discussion.

**Time**

15 minutes

Throughout the Language Dive

Encourage rich conversation among students about the meaning of each of the sentence chunk strip, what the academic phrases within each chunk mean, and how they relate to the sentence and the text overall. Monitor and guide conversation with total participation techniques and Conversation Cues.

After asking questions, provide students up to 1 minute of think-time to reflect, depending on the complexity of the question. Alternatively, invite partners to discuss, providing an allocated time for each student.

Record and display student responses next to or underneath the target language for visual reference.

Although students should briefly discuss all chunks in each Language Dive sentence, invite them to slow down during one chunk, called the focus structure, to investigate and practice a particularly compelling language structure.

Where possible, place sketches, pictures, or illustrations above key nouns and verbs in the chunks after discussing their meanings. This allows students to quickly access the content of each chunk as they work with the structures in the sentence as a whole.

For translation work, invite students to use their online or paper translation dictionary if necessary. Invite students to add new vocabulary to their vocabulary logs.

Note: Some responses to questions in the Language Dive indicate only that “Responses will vary.” Like one the larger goals of Language Dives, “Responses will vary” is intended to suggest that students should be encouraged to grapple with questions and ideas, develop interest and participation, and not be immediately steered toward “correct” responses. Indeed, even where correct responses are provided, continue to invite a culture of inquiry and grappling.

**Key**

Red

Blue

Launch

- Welcome students to their first Grade 6 Language Dive. Display the term **Language Dive**.

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partner. Say:

“What do you think a Language Dive is?”/“Based on your first/second Language Dive, what do you think a Language Dive is?” (Responses will vary.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- If productive, cue students to clarify the conversation by confirming what they mean. If necessary, prompt students’ responses with sentence frames: “Yes, you’ve got it” or “No, sorry, that’s not what I mean. What I mean is \_\_\_\_\_.” Say:

“So, do you mean \_\_\_\_\_?” (Responses will vary.)

- Confirm or amend and display students’ ideas.

Deconstruct

- Tell students about the first step in the Deconstruct stage:

“When we do a Language Dive, first we read the sentence. We talk about what we think it means and how it might help us understand our guiding question.”

- Invite students to put their finger by this sentence from “Why Ancient Greek Mythology Is Still Relevant Today” on their note-catchers: **<u>After all,</u> a lot of these stories tell tales of how human follies, stupidity, and even hubris get people in trouble.**

- Say:

“What does this sentence mean to you?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“How does this sentence add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- Say:

“Next, we take the sentence apart, chunk by chunk. We figure out what each chunk means, and why it’s important. Let’s talk about the first chunk of this sentence.”

get people in trouble.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following sentence chunk strip: **get people in trouble.**

- Say:

“Does this chunk come at the beginning of the sentence? How do you know?” (no; because it ends with a period)

“Why might we start with the last chunk first?” (Responses will vary.)

- Remind students of some relevant goals of Language Dives: to improve critical thinking, to understand how different chunks in a sentence relate to one another, and to practice reconstructing sentences. Point out that varying the order of the chunks can be a useful way to meet these goals.

- Draw students’ attention back to the chunk, and ask:

“What does this chunk mean to you?” (Responses will vary.)

“What kind of things get people in trouble?” (Responses will vary.)

- If productive, cue students to expand the conversation by giving an example:

“Can you give an example?” (Responses will vary.)

- Say:

“Let’s talk about the second chunk.”

human follies, stupidity, and even hubris

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **human follies, stupidity, and even hubris**

- Tell students that highlighting language can help them notice important structures and patterns.

- Underline follies and hubris in blue, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 🖉

- Say:

“Does anyone know what these two words mean: follies or hubris?” (Accept, but do not verify student answers; students may remember the definition of hubris from the close read, but they are unlikely to know follies.)

- Remind students that it’s common to come across unknown words in the texts they are reading. Tell them that today they will be practicing a couple of strategies to figure out what the unknown words mean.

- Say:

“One good strategy for guessing the meaning of an unknown word is to look at the context. We know from the first chunk that these words describe things that get people in trouble. So we know that hubris and follies can get us in trouble. Does anyone know what the other word in this list means: stupidity?” (lack of intelligence; foolishness; the quality of being a stupid person)

“Do we usually think of stupidity as a positive or negative trait?” (negative)

“If stupidity is a negative trait, do you think the words follies and hubris are likely to describe positive traits, or other negative traits like stupidity? How do you know?” (They are likely to describe negative traits; we know because they are in a list and grouped together and because negative traits get us in trouble.)

- Say:

“We’ve just used context to learn a little more about the words follies and hubris. We know that they probably mean something negative.”

- Tell students that another strategy for figuring out unknown words is thinking about their part of speech.

- Say:

“What part of speech do you think the word stupidity is: a noun, verb, or adjective? How do you know?” (noun; because of the -ity affix, or because of prior knowledge)

- Encourage students to think about the affix **-ity** at the end of the word, which signifies that a word is a noun. Invite or provide additional examples of **-ity** nouns (e.g., *unity, cavity, ability*) so students can recognize a pattern.

- Say:

“Because follies and hubris are in the same list as stupidity, which is a noun, do you think that follies and hubris are likely to be nouns as well, or do you think they will be a different part of speech, like verbs or adjectives?” (They are likely to be nouns as well.)

- Say:

“Based on what we’ve inferred about the words follies and hubris, let’s try to make guesses about what they could mean.”

- Cue students to think and process this language internally. Say/ask:

“I’ll give you time to think about what follies and hubris might mean. Remember that they should be negative, and they should be nouns. You have one minute to guess the meanings of these words, and then we’ll check our guesses using a dictionary. Write or draw your guesses on your note-catcher.” 🖉 (Responses will vary, but look for students’ use of nouns that describe negative traits as guesses.)

- After inviting responses, write and display student ideas.

- Ask students to confirm the definitions using their dictionaries. These can be paper, online, translation, or learners’ dictionaries. Encourage students to compare findings with a partner.

- Say:

“According to the best definition in the dictionary, what are follies?” (foolish actions or ideas)

“And what is hubris?” (arrogance; excessive confidence/pride)

- Students should write these definitions on their note-catchers (and, if time allows, also in their vocabulary logs). Invite students to compare these dictionary definitions to their own preliminary guesses. Celebrate students’ abilities to make guesses and use dictionaries to learn new words.

- Say:

“Let’s talk about the third chunk.”

a lot of these stories tell tales

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **a lot of these stories tell tales**

- Say:

“What are ‘these stories’?” (myths)

“What does this chunk tell us about the guiding question, What is mythology?” (Responses may vary, but might clue: mythology is about stories called myths, some myths talk about the bad choices that people make.)

- After inviting responses, write and display student ideas.

- Say:

“Let’s talk about the fourth and final chunk.”

After all,

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **After all,**

- Say:

“Does anyone know what the phrase after all means?” (Responses will vary.)

- Tell students that **after all** can mean different things depending on how the phrase is used in context. Draw students’ attention to the two examples on their note-catcher. Invite a volunteer to read the two sentences aloud: (A) I know I said I would come to your party, but I can’t come **after all**; (B) We have plenty of time before the weekend to decide. **After all**, it’s only Monday.

- Using a Conversation Cue to allow time to think and process language internally, say:

“I’ll give you time to talk with your partner about sentences (A) and (B). What do you think are some of the differences in how these two after alls are used? Think about what they mean, where they are in the sentence, and anything else you notice. You have 1 minute. You can take notes or sketch pictures on your note-catcher if you want.” 🖉 (Verify and correct student answers: \[A\] means against what was expected and, here, it comes at the end of a sentence; \[B\] is used to emphasize or draw extra attention to something and it comes at the beginning of a sentence).

- Give students 1 minute to discuss answers. Invite student responses.

- Draw students’ attention back to the sentence chunk strips.

- Say:

“Based on context, what do you think after all means in this sentence?” (It is being used to emphasize or draw attention to the information of the sentence.)

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Tell students they will now practice using this structure: “You’ve played with this chunk and figured out the meaning. Now let’s use **after all** in a sentence for our own speaking and writing.”

- Display the following sentence frames:

1.  **Percy should have told someone sooner about Mrs. Dodds. After all, \_\_\_\_\_.**

2.  **Percy’s mother thought he would be safe at Yancy Academy, but \_\_\_\_\_ after all.**

- Point out that one of these sentence frames uses **after all** to mean against what was expected, and the other sentence frame uses **after all** to draw extra attention to something.

- Say:

“Use these frames to talk about Percy and chapter 3 of The Lightning Thief in your own words within your triad. You can also take notes on your note-catcher, if you wish.” 🖉

- Invite and display student responses.

After all, a lot of these stories tell tales of how human follies, stupidity, and even hubris get people in trouble.

Reconstruct

- Tell students they will now go from the Deconstruct to the Reconstruct stage:

“Now that you’ve played with the chunks, let’s put them all back together again into a sentence. And let’s see how playing with the chunks adds to our understanding of the meaning of the sentence and our guiding question. Let’s see how reconstructing helps us understand how English works.”

- Point to and read the entire sentence on display: **After all,** a lot of these stories tell tales of how human follies, stupidity, and even hubris get people in trouble.  
  Underline the subject, *a lot of these stories,* in blue, and underline the predicate, *tell tales of how human follies, stupidity, and even hubris get people in trouble,* in red.

- Ask students to look at the underlined words. Say:

“What do you notice about the words underlined in blue and red?” (The words in blue tell us what the sentence is about \[a lot of these stories\]; the words in red tell us what that thing does \[tell tales of how human follies, stupidity, and even hubris get people in trouble\].)

- If students are unfamiliar with subject and predicate, explain that the words underlined in blue are the subject, and the words underlined in red are the predicate.

- Say:

“Based on this example, what do you think a subject must have? What must a predicate have?” (A subject must have a noun or noun phrase; a predicate must have a verb or verb phrase.)

“What is the noun in this subject? What is the verb in this predicate?” (stories; tell)

- Tell students you will give them time to think and discuss with their partner. Ask, one question at a time:

“I wonder why the predicate is so long. Why did the writers add on to this predicate? How did they do it?” (The writers wanted to combine many ideas into one sentence. They used a series of phrases.)

“What if we remove this long predicate?” Experiment with removing the red chunks and rereading the sentence aloud: “After all, a lot of these stories.” (It doesn’t make sense. The subject, a lot of these stories, isn’t doing anything. It needs the predicate.)

“Can you figure out why we need to know about subjects and predicates in English?” (Most English sentences have a subject with a predicate. We almost always need to write a subject with a predicate in our sentences.)

- If productive, cue students to expand the conversation by giving an example:

“Can you give an example?” (Responses will vary.)

- After inviting responses, write and display student ideas.

- Say:

“What other questions can we ask that will help us understand this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question, What is mythology?” (Responses will vary.)

- After inviting responses, write and display student ideas.

Practice

- Say:

“You did well putting the chunks back together again and talking about how this Language Dive has added your understanding of the meaning of the sentence and the guiding question.”

- Tell students they will now go from the Reconstruct to the Practice stage:

“You’ve played with the sentence and figured out the meaning, and why it’s important to the guiding question. Now let’s start to use the language in the sentence for our own speaking and writing.”

- Display the sentence frame: **Human follies, stupidity, and hubris are common in mythology because** \_\_\_\_\_**.**

- Tell students you will give them time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use this frame to talk about the role of follies, stupidity, and hubris in mythology with your triad. You can take notes on your note-catcher, if you wish.” **🖉**

- If productive, cue students to clarify their sentences by confirming what they mean: “So, do you mean \_\_\_\_\_?” (Responses will vary. Ensure that students are using the structure meaningfully.)

- After inviting responses, write and display student ideas.

- Congratulate students on completing the Language Dive to better understand the meaning of this sentence, how it connects to the guiding question, and how to use it in their own speaking and writing.
