The article “Why Ancient Greek Mythology Is Still Relevant Today” explains that references to ancient Greek myths are still found today in movies, literature, and art. Greek myths are still popular because they teach lessons that still apply to people’s lives. Myths “had to have purpose and they had to impart knowledge.” Besides teaching important life lessons, Greek myths are filled with action that appeals to many readers. The message of the article connects to the novel, *The Lightning Thief,* because both demonstrate how Greek myths influence modern culture. In *The Lightning Thief*, Chiron points out that there is a statue of Prometheus in Rockefeller Center, Greek facades on important buildings, and even the eagle, an important American symbol, was originally the symbol of Zeus. Both texts argue that even though Greek myths are hundreds of years old, they still contain life lessons and exciting action, which makes them interesting even to a modern audience.
