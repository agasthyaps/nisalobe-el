Sample student response: *The Lightning Thief* by Rick Riordan teaches the theme, or message, that all people desire acceptance. Early in the novel, Percy, the main character, describes himself as “troubled’ and a “mental-case” because he has been diagnosed with dyslexia and ADHD. He has been expelled from a number of schools and is often the target of the bully, Nancy Bobofit. It is clear that Percy is lonely; he even sits away from the rest of his classmates during lunch on a field trip. His only friend is Grover, and Percy even attempts to ditch Grover after he is expelled from yet another school, Yancy Academy. Percy’s sadness and disappointment at not being able to fit in and make friends at school reflects the theme that everyone desires acceptance.
