**Directions:** As you enter class, read the learning targets. Next, complete the following.

Read this sentence from chapter 10 of *The Lightning Thief*:

“The Time of the Titans was the Fourth Age, sometimes called the Golden Age, which is definitely a **misnomer**” (155).

Use the affix list to break the word down into its affixes and root using this chart:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 14%" />
<col style="width: 43%" />
<col style="width: 41%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th></th>
<th>Word Parts and Meaning</th>
<th>Origin</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Prefix</p>
<p>(before the root)</p></td>
<td><strong><em>mis-</em> (wrong)</strong></td>
<td><strong>Middle English</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Root</td>
<td><strong><em>nom</em> (name)</strong></td>
<td><strong>Latin</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Suffix</p>
<p>(after the root)</p></td>
<td><strong><em>-er</em> (creates noun from verb)</strong></td>
<td><strong>Middle English</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Based on the affixes, write a definition of **misnomer** in your own words.
