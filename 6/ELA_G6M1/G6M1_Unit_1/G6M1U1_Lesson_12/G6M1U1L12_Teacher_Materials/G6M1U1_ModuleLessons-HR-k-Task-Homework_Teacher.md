What two pieces of evidence from the text helped you determine his point of view?

“Your mom married Gabe for you,” Grover told me (158).

“Your stepfather smells so repulsively human he could mask the presence of any demigod” (159).

“As soon as I took a whiff inside his Camaro, I knew: Gabe has been covering your scent for years” (159).  
“If you hadn’t lived with him every summer, you probably would’ve been found by monsters a long time ago” (159).

“Your mom stayed with him to protect you. She was a smart lady. She must’ve loved you a lot to put up with that guy—if that makes you feel any better” (159).
