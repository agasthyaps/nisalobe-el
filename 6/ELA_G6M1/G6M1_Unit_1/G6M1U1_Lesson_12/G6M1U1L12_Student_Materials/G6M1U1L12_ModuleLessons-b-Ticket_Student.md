Use the affix list to break the word down into its affixes and root using this chart:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 16%" />
<col style="width: 53%" />
<col style="width: 29%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th></th>
<th>Word Parts and Meaning</th>
<th>Origin</th>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Prefix</p>
<p>(before the root)</p></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Root</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
