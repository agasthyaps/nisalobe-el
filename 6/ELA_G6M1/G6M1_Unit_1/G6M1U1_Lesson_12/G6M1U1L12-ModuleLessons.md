Lesson Overview

Lesson Summary

This lesson acts as an introduction to the literacy concept of theme. Students will engage in a deeper dive of this concept in Unit 2. Their examination of the narrator’s point of view thus far in the novel should begin to reveal the themes, or messages, that the author believes are important.

Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- L.6.4b – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they break down an unfamiliar word from chapter 10 of *The Lightning Thief* into a recognizable prefix, root word, and suffix.

- RL.6.1 – Work Time A: Students read the next chapter of the text and find the gist. Students also unpack unfamiliar vocabulary and answer comprehension questions using inferences and evidence from text.

- RL.6.3 – Work Time A: After students finish reading, they are invited to discuss the challenges that Percy faced in chapter 10, describe his responses to those challenges, and speculate about connections between his actions and his character.

- RL.6.2 – Work Time B: Students participate in a movement activity to demonstrate understanding of theme as distinct from main ideas or topics. This lesson acts as an introduction to the literacy concept of theme. Students engage in a deeper dive of this concept in Unit 2. Their examination of the narrator’s point of view thus far in the novel should begin to reveal the themes, or messages, that the author believes are important.

- RL.6.1 – Closing and Assessment A: Students complete a QuickWrite that requires them to use textual evidence to support their analysis of theme in *The Lightning Thief*.

- RL.6.2 – Closing and Assessment A: Students analyze themes in *The Lightning Thief* through a QuickWrite.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Encourage students to identify the theme in several popular novels and movies. If some students are pre-taught about theme, they could aid in delivering this lesson by preparing visuals (posters, slideshows) in advance that illustrate examples of themes in well-known texts and movies.

- Students who have been introduced to the archetype of Hero’s Journey in a previous lesson may be tempted to label “Hero’s Journey” as a theme. Remind them that a theme is the message, or lesson, that an author reveals through a significant and repeated idea in a text.

- Invite students to analyze point of view in the chapter.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students completed the mid-unit assessment that focused on point of view. Students continue to analyze how the author develops the narrator’s point of view in future lessons. This lesson focuses on theme as an introduction to a more extensive examination of theme in Unit 2. Theme is often revealed through the narrator’s point of view, which students have practiced analyzing several times by this point in Unit 1.

Support All Students

- Note there is a differentiated version of the QuickWrite: Theme in *The Lightning Thief* used in Closing and Assessment A in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Students may need additional support discerning theme from topic. Remind students that the themes of a text are the statements or observations that an author is making about life. It is a message rooted in the text but relevant to a broader audience. The author reveals his or her opinion on a topic through a recurring theme in the text (e.g., “Good always triumphs over evil” is a theme; “Greek mythology” is a topic).

- To supplement class discussion on theme with a more visual component, capture ideas on a whiteboard or display posters with relevant information. Provide options also in the way students report identified themes (through written notes, pictures, orally, etc.). ▲

- At this point in the unit, students should be familiar with the reading routine. Facilitate opportunities for students to vary the routine of their in-class reading (e.g., encourage them to switch their reading partner(s) or read independently in a new part of the classroom).

- To support ELLs, this lesson offers opportunities for students to practice and reinforce skills introduced in earlier lessons (e.g., affix identification), and presents the idea of theme in a thoughtfully scaffolded way, preparing students for work with theme in Unit 2.

- ELLs may find it challenging to differentiate themes from topics or main ideas. Be prepared to provide additional examples and clarification as needed.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.B.6c and 6.I.B.7.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ gist statements and QuickWrites as they work to identify common issues. Use these common issues as teaching points in the whole group share-out.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will read from chapter 11 of *The Lightning Thief*. They will also generate discussion norms in preparation for the end of unit assessment, in which they engage in a Socratic Seminar focused on how Percy reveals his character through his actions.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Determine Unfamiliar Words – L.6.4b (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 12**.

- Ask:

“How did you use the **affix list** to determine the meaning of this unfamiliar word?”

- Remind students that recognizing the smaller parts of words to determine the definition of an unfamiliar word helps them to become more fluent readers.

- Record the meaning of the word on the **academic word wall** with translations in students’ home languages. ▲

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- During Opening A, rather than having students generate their own “translations” of *misnomer*, provide students with a short list from which to select the best answer. Each answer could include all three parts (“wrong,” “name,” and “having a characteristic”) but be phrased in different ways, exercising students’ ability to identify appropriate phrasing and syntax.

Opening

B. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

- With students, use the vocabulary strategies on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart** to deconstruct the word *theme* (the message, or lesson, that an author reveals through a significant and repeated idea in a text). Record on the **domain-specific word wall** with translations in home languages, where appropriate ▲, and invite students to record words in their **vocabulary logs**.

Work Time

A. Read *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 10 Excerpt – RL.6.3 (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Read aloud the selected excerpt, using **Text Guide: *The Lightning Thief*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Refer to the following resources as appropriate to support this section of the lesson: **Gist Record: *The Lightning Thief*** **anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**, vocabulary logs, **chapter synopsis**, and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Excerpts:

- Starting at page 149 “It didn’t take long for me to pack . . . ” and ending at page 153 “ . . . but this sword wouldn’t hurt them in any case”.

- Starting at page 160 “The rain kept coming down . . . ” and ending at page 167 “We plunged into the woods as the rain poured down, the bus in flames behind us, and nothing but darkness ahead.”

- Gist: Percy and his friends are attacked by the three Furies from the Underworld.

- Ask:

“What challenge does Percy face in chapter 10?” (The trio is attacked by the Furies on a bus.)

“What is his response to that challenge?” (Percy has a chance to escape using Annabeth’s invisibility cap, but he instead finds a way to save his friends. He jerks the wheel of the bus off the road and fights the Furies with his sword, Riptide.)

“What might that reveal about this character?” (This shows that Percy is loyal and self-sacrificing. He chooses his friends over his own self-preservation.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

B. Introduce Theme – RL.6.2 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can identify themes in *The Lightning Thief*.”

- Display and direct students’ attention to the **Determine Themes: *The Lightning Thief*** **anchor chart**. Remind students of the definition they determined for theme during Opening B of this lesson (the message, or lesson, that an author reveals through a significant and repeated idea in a text). Record this definition on the anchor chart. Refer to the **Determine Themes: *The Lightning Thief*** **anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** as needed. Tell students they will be adding to this anchor chart in Unit 2.

- Tell students that a good way to determine a theme in a literary text is to ask the question, “What does a character or the narrator learn?”

- Explain that students will now participate in a movement activity to demonstrate their understanding of theme as distinct from main ideas or topics. Review the directions for the movement activity.

- You will be handed a card with a statement on it.

- Moving safely about the room, find a partner and read your statement to your partner.

- After reading, explain if your statement is a theme or main idea, followed by an explanation for your thinking. Pause to allow your partner to agree or respectfully disagree and follow up with his/her thinking.

- Listen respectfully as your partner takes a turn reading his/her statement, sharing his/her label of main idea or theme, and providing an explanation.

- Exchange cards and move on, finding a new partner, and repeating the process with your new statement card.

- Review expectations for moving safely and quietly about the classroom. Model the process with a confident student before beginning the protocol. Distribute the **Theme vs. Main Idea Sorting Cards**, one for each student.

- Circulate and monitor as students engage in the movement activity. Challenge students to justify their thinking in detailed explanations, and clarify any misconceptions that may arise.

- Refocus the whole group. Invite students who are holding a theme card to post their card on a prepared display using **tape** or **thumbtacks**. Invite students holding a non-theme card to post their statement in a different area of a prepared display.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time B, provide a few short sentences that use the word *theme* in context. Build students’ inductive learning abilities by encouraging pairs to develop working definitions of *theme* based on the way it is used in each sentence.

For Heavier Support

- Annotate theme/main idea statements with small drawings that illustrate meaning. This support will help direct students’ mental energy toward the goal of this activity (differentiating theme from main idea), rather than meaning-making.

Closing and Assessment

A. QuickWrite: Theme in *The Lightning Thief* – RL.6.2 (5 minutes)

- Distribute and display **QuickWrite: Theme in *The Lightning Thief*** or **QuickWrite: Theme in *The Lightning Thief*** ▲. Allow students enough time to answer the given prompt.

- Praise students for showing perseverance as they learned a new concept (theme) and applied it to a new skill (QuickWrite).

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- Invite students to create sentence frames to support writing and speaking about theme. Encourage students who need heavier support to use the frames.

For Heavier Support

- Provide sentence frames to support writing and speaking about theme.

Homework

A. Analyze Point of View

- Students complete **Homework: Lesson 12: Point of View: *The Lightning Thief***, **Chapter 10**.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students should preread chapter 11 of *The Lightning Thief* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.
