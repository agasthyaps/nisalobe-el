Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- L.6.4 – Opening A: Students consult a dictionary to confirm the precise meaning of an unknown word in the text.

- Work Time A: Students complete the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment. The assessment invites students to use evidence from *The Lightning Thief* to support their analysis of what the text says, apply strategies to determine the meanings of unknown words as they are used in the text, answer questions about how the author develops Percy’s point of view toward another character, and interpret figurative language and word relationships in the text. (RL.6.1, RL.6.4, RL.6.6, L.6.4a, L.6.4c, L.6.4d, L.6.5, L.6.6)

- RL.6.6 – Closing and Assessment A: Students review point of view.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- In Work Time A, students may want to read the chapter silently and complete the mid-unit assessment without any instruction. Release them to this independence if they are ready for it.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the lessons leading up to this assessment, students have read the novel for gist and unfamiliar vocabulary and practiced analyzing language and point of view in *The Lightning Thief*. This lesson continues those routines in an assessment with the next chapter of the novel.

Support All Students

- As before, continue to be mindful about issues and characterizations that may be sensitive for students or with which some students may connect personally or deeply. In addition to the issues that have been noted previously, this chapter does include a mention of suicide and talk about the death of Percy’s mom’s parents in a car accident. Additionally, Percy is feeling isolated, alone, and further bullied when someone leaves an upsetting newspaper article for him to find.

- Students may need additional support with the reading of the chapter. As during previous lessons in which reading takes place, provide students with a number of options (small group, pairs, individual), sometimes allowing them to decide and sometimes deciding for them, taking into account their strengths, needs, and interests and grouping deliberately as needed. ▲ No matter what options are chosen, also be mindful about variety, being sure to change the routine to maintain engagement and to support students effectively.

- Some students may need the text read aloud before they work on the questions. Invite students who require this support to sit in a group away from the rest of the students, so as not to be distracting.

- Students who would benefit from fluency practice should be encouraged and supported during Work Time A to read with a partner or small group. ▲

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment.

- For some students, this assessment may require more than the 35 minutes allotted. Provide time over multiple days if necessary.

- To support ELLs, this lesson invites students to complete assessment tasks similar to the classroom tasks completed in Lessons 1–10.

- ELLs may find it challenging to independently complete the mid-unit assessment without scaffolding. Point out that the mid-unit assessment is similar to the activities they have successfully completed in class. Encourage students to do their best, and assure them that they will continue learning together after the assessment.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.B.6b and 6.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- Mid-Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Language and Point of View: *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 9 (student and teacher versions) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students continue in their anchor text, reading from chapter 10 of *The Lightning Thief* for gist and unfamiliar vocabulary, and then begin determining themes in *The Lightning Thief*, which sets the stage for continued work with theme in Unit 2.

- For the rest of Unit 1, students continue to read excerpts from chapters of *The Lightning Thief*, determining gist, recording unfamiliar vocabulary, and examining point of view and use of language. During Unit 2, students read Greek stories introduced in the novel and view clips from the film version of *The Lightning Thief* to compare the experience of reading versus viewing the story.

- Students’ Mid-Unit 1 Assessments will be returned in Lesson 15 with feedback.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.6.4 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 11**.

- Once all students have arrived, review the question and answer (*gruesome memento – a frightening souvenir or reminder*). Record on the **academic word wall** with translations in home languages, where appropriate ▲, and invite students to record words in their **vocabulary logs**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Mid-Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Language and Point of View: *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 9 (35 minutes)

- Distribute **Mid-Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Language and Point of View: *The Lightning Thief***, **Chapter 9**, and invite students to take out their copies of ***The Lightning Thief***.

- Tell students that for this assessment, they will independently read a new chapter in their anchor text. They will then answer questions to analyze language use and point of view.

- Read aloud the directions for each part of the assessment as students follow along, reading silently. Make sure students understand the assessment directions; paraphrase some instructions, if needed. ▲ Answer students’ questions, but refrain from supplying answers to the assessment questions themselves.

- Direct students’ attention to the following anchor charts:

- **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart**

- **Strategies to Answer Selected Response Questions anchor chart**

- **Point of View anchor chart**

- Remind students to refer to these anchor charts as they read the assessment text and answer the assessment questions.

- Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**. Explain that it says at the top that effective learners are people who develop the mindsets and skills for success in college, career, and life.

- Read aloud the habit of character recorded:

“I persevere. This means I challenge myself. When something is difficult or demanding, I keep trying and ask for help if I need it.”

- Invite students to Turn and Talk to their partner. Then cold call students to share:

“What does perseverance look like? What might you see when someone is persevering?” (See **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart \[example for teacher reference\]**.)

“What does perseverance sound like? What might you hear when someone is persevering?” (See **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart \[example for teacher reference\].)**

“Where have you seen examples of perseverance demonstrated in *The Lightning Thief*?” (Possible response: When Percy is attempting to find out what he is good at, he tries archery, racing, and wrestling before realizing he excelled at canoeing. He didn’t give up even when he was feeling frustrated.)

- As students share, record their responses in the appropriate column on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**.

- Record *perseverance* on the academic word wall. Invite students to add translations of the words in their home languages in a different color next to the target vocabulary. ▲

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence. Remind students that because they will be reading and answering questions independently for the assessment, they may need to practice perseverance.

- Invite students to begin the assessment.

- While they are taking the assessment, circulate to monitor and document their test-taking skills. Refer to **Synopsis: *The Lightning Thief***, **Chapter 9** as necessary, but do not share this handout with students to avoid compromising the integrity of the assessment.

- Give students specific, positive feedback on their completion of the End of Unit 1 Assessment. Refer to **Mid-Unit 1 Assessment: Analyze Language and Point of View: *The Lightning Thief***, **Chapter 9 (example for teacher reference)** to assess.

For Lighter Support

- To set themselves up for success for the mid-unit assessment, students need to generalize the skills that they learned from previous sessions. Before administering the assessment, activate their prior knowledge by recalling the learning targets from previous sessions and reflecting on the similar tasks that they have already completed.

For Heavier Support

- Before the mid-unit assessment, allow students to review the language they have written on the word walls or in their vocabulary logs.

- Underline key vocabulary in the mid-unit assessment directions, and read aloud together as a class to ensure that students understand each task included in the assessment.

- Display a “map” of the assessment to reference while explaining directions to the mid-unit assessment. This will reduce ambiguity and give students a clearer picture of what they can expect so that they can better allocate their time and attentional resources. Provide students with **colored pencils** or **highlighters** so that they can mark up the “map” as needed. Example:

**Part I**: Use strategies to interpret words and sentences in *The Lightning Thief*. These strategies include: interpreting word relationships, looking at context, using a dictionary, or breaking down a word into its affixes.

**Part II**: Reread pages from *The Lightning Thief*. Answer questions about how the author develops Percy’s point of view. Explain how Percy’s point of view toward Chiron has changed.

Closing and Assessment

A. Review Point of View – RL.6.6 (5 minutes)

- After 5 minutes, refocus the whole group. Focus students on the point of view questions on their assessments. Ask students to connect the learning represented on the Point of View anchor chart to the questions on the assessment. See **Point of View anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**.

- If productive, ask students to discuss which assessment task was easiest and which was the most difficult, and why. In future lessons and for homework, focus on the language skills that will help students address these assessment challenges. ▲

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Homework

A. Preread Anchor Text

- Students should preread chapter 10 of *The Lightning Thief* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.
