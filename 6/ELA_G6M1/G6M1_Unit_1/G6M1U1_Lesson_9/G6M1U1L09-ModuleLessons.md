Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- L.4.1f – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they correct a fragment from *The Lightning Thief* and turn it into a complete sentence, reviewing language standards taught in previous grades. These standards require continued attention in higher grades as they are applied to increasingly sophisticated writing and speaking. Students review the opening activity during Work Time B before they complete the text-dependent questions.

- L.6.5 – Work Time A: Students explore the function of *as if* as a more formal alternative to *like* to introduce similes in day 1 of a two-day Language Dive (day 2 occurs as part of Lesson 10). They also apply strategies to interpret the meanings of unknown words. See the Tools Page (http://eled.org/tools) for additional information regarding a consistent Language Dive routine. Students then apply their understanding of word relationships to chapter 7 for homework through both open-ended and selected response questions. Please refer to Homework: Language Dive Practice: Word Relationships: *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 7 (answers for teacher reference).

- RL.6.1 – Work Time B: Students read the next chapter of the text and find the gist. Students also unpack unfamiliar vocabulary and answer comprehension questions using inferences and evidence from text.

- RL.6.3 – Work Time B: After students finish reading, they discuss the challenges that Percy faced in chapter 7, describe his responses to those challenges, and speculate about connections between his actions and his character.

- RL.6.4 – Work Time C: When answering text-dependent questions, students determine the meanings of words and phrases as they are used in chapter 7 of *The Lightning Thief*.

- L.6.4 – Work Time C: Students respond to text-dependent questions, applying a variety of strategies to other unknown words in the text in order to discern their meanings.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Given the possible content issues mentioned in Support All Students, one possible idea for extension would be to further examine, unpack, and discuss the ways in which Riordan represents the female characters, varying physical and cognitive abilities, and social class. Additionally, balance the Western perspective by the inclusion of non-Western influence or to examine similar myths of non-Western cultures, like the *Ramayana*, for example.

- Invite students to identify Percy’s point of view toward different characters in chapter 7, for example Annabeth and Luke, and to explain how the author has developed this point of view.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students have read through chapter 6 of *The Lightning Thief*, found the gist, determined the meanings of unfamiliar words and phrases, and analyzed point of view and language use. In this lesson, students continue to read the novel and expand their thinking about point of view and language use as well as how Percy has responded to challenges in preparation for the Mid-Unit 1 and End of Unit 1 Assessments.

Support All Students

- Note there is a differentiated version of Text-Dependent Questions: *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 7 used in Work Time C in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Continue to be mindful about issues and characterizations that may be sensitive for students or with which some students may connect personally or deeply. In addition to the issues that have been noted previously, this chapter discusses the difficult relationships experienced between Percy, Annabeth, and Luke, and their parents, whether the immortal ones or the human ones.

- After reading this chapter of the text for the gist, ensure that students have time to reflect. Monitor students and determine if there are issues surfacing that need to be discussed in more detail as a whole group, in smaller groups, or independently. Be aware that reflections may be personal, and students are not required to share them.

- Students may need additional support with the reading of the chapter. Continue to provide students with a number of options for reading (small group, pairs, individual), sometimes allowing them to decide and sometimes deciding for them, taking into account their strengths, needs, and interests and grouping deliberately as needed. ▲ No matter what options are chosen, also be mindful about variety, being sure to change the routine to maintain engagement and to support students effectively.

- Students may need additional support with determining the gist, working through unfamiliar vocabulary, and answering text-dependent questions. Again, use thoughtful pairing, and consider which groups might need more constant support. ▲

- Students who would benefit from fluency practice should be encouraged and supported during Work Time B to read with a partner or small group. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson leads students through a Language Dive to accelerate linguistic growth and cultivate understanding of word relationships and continues to provide opportunities for scaffolded reading of a literary text. The Language Dive is divided across two lessons to allow students to deeply explore the content and structure of the sentence without overwhelming them.

- ELLs may find it challenging to begin a Language Dive with the last chunk first. Remind them of some relevant goals of Language Dives: to improve critical thinking, to understand how distinct chunks in a sentence relate to one another, and to practice reconstructing sentences. Point out that varying the order of the chunks can be a useful way to meet these goals.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.B.6a, and 6.II.A.1.

Assessment Guidance

- In Work Time B and Closing and Assessment A, review students’ answers to the text-dependent questions to identify common issues. Use these common issues as teaching points in the whole group share-out.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students engage in a Language Dive focused on word connotations and how those help to convey meaning. Students read from chapter 8 for gist and unfamiliar vocabulary, and then continue analyzing how Riordan conveys Percy’s point of view. This work will be assessed during Lesson 11 via the mid-unit assessment.

- For the rest of Unit 1, students continue to read chapters from *The Lightning Thief*, determining gist, recording unfamiliar vocabulary, and examining point of view and use of language. During Unit 2, students finish reading the novel, focusing on Percy’s character and themes in comparison to Greek myths to which they’ve been introduced through the novel.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.4.1f (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 9**.

- See **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 9 (for teacher reference)**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Language Dive: *The Lightning Thief*, Page 96 – L.6.5 (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can use word relationships to determine meaning in *The Lightning Thief*.”

- Tell students they will now participate in day 1 of a two-day Language Dive to examine how relationships between words help us determine meaning.

- Reread aloud page 96 of ***The Lightning Thief***.

- Focus students on the sentence:

“I thought about some of the kids I’d seen in the Hermes cabin, teenagers who looked sullen and depressed, as if they were waiting for a call that would never come” (96).

- Use the **Language Dive Guide: *The Lightning Thief***, **Page 96 (for teacher reference)** and the **Language Dive: *The Lightning Thief***, **Page 96 sentence chunk strips** to guide students through a Language Dive conversation about the sentence. Display and distribute the **Language Dive: *The Lightning Thief***, **Page 96 note-catcher** and **colored pencils**.

- See the **Language Dive: *The Lightning Thief***, **Page 96 note-catcher (example for teacher reference)**.

- During the Language Dive, continue to use Goal 1 Conversation Cues to gauge student comprehension, and encourage students to elaborate upon or clarify their responses. ▲

- Administer the Language Dive in small groups, and sit near students in need of most additional support. During the quick partner discussions embedded in the Language Dive, work directly with these students and monitor progress. ▲

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- To support student comprehension of the Language Dive in Work Time A, provide students with examples of uses of the focus structure *as if* in other contexts

Work Time

B. Read *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 7 Excerpt – RL.6.3 (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Read aloud the selected excerpt, using **Text Guide: *The Lightning Thief*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students continue to record the gist on sticky notes, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Refer to the following resources as appropriate to support this section of the lesson: **Gist Record: *The Lightning Thief*** **anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**, **vocabulary logs**, **chapter synopsis**, and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Excerpt: Starting at page 93 “Word of the bathroom incident spread immediately . . . ” and ending at page 100 “ . . . I left her on the pier, tracing her finger across the rail as if drawing a battle plan”; and starting at page 105 “When everybody had returned to their seats . . . ” and ending at page 106 “ . . . I wish I’d known how briefly I would get to enjoy my new home.”

- Gist: Percy settles into camp and gets to know Annabeth and Luke better.

- Ask:

“What challenge does Percy face in chapter 7?” (coming to terms with his father as a god)

“What is his response to that challenge?” (Percy is beginning to realize Annabeth may be telling the truth, but his emotions go back forth between wanting to believe that his father really loved his mother and is different from Annabeth’s to being angry and resentful that his father has been absent.)

“What might that reveal about this character?” (Percy feels lost and unsure about whom to trust and what to think about the information he’s trying to process.)

“In what ways did the characters demonstrate or not demonstrate a habit of character in this chapter?” (Possible response: Percy demonstrates empathy when Annabeth sadly explains that she has no contact with her immortal mother or her mortal father.)

Work Time

C. Complete Text-Dependent Questions: *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 7 – L.6.4 (10 minutes)

- Distribute **Text-Dependent Questions: *The Lightning Thief***, **Chapter 7** or **Text-Dependent Questions: *The Lightning Thief***, **Chapter 7** ▲.

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can determine the meanings of unfamiliar words and phrases in chapter 7 of *The Lightning Thief*.”

- Before inviting students to begin responding to the questions, briefly review the language question posted at the beginning of the lesson. Redirect them to the activity, and ask:

“What is a complete sentence?” (a group of words that contains a subject and a predicate and that expresses a complete thought)

“Why is this a fragment and not a complete sentence?” (because it does not contain a subject and a predicate)

“How might you turn this fragment into a sentence?” (Answers will vary, but should include a subject and predicate. E.g., “Percy and his friends were hanging out back at Cabin 11” or “Back at Cabin 11, everyone was talking.”)

- Remind students that whenever they write a sentence, it must contain a subject and a predicate and express a complete thought. Tell students to keep this in mind as they answer the text-dependent questions.

- Invite students to work in their reading triads to answer the questions. Circulate to support students as needed.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- Before Work Time C, if time allows, challenge students to generate their own text-dependent questions before reviewing those written for the lesson. This gives students an opportunity to practice syntax and demonstrate their comprehension and critical thinking.

For Heavier Support

N/A

Closing and Assessment

A. Review Text-Dependent Questions for Chapter 7 – L.6.4 (5 minutes)

- Invite students to share their responses to the text-dependent questions. Refer to **Text-Dependent Questions: *The Lightning Thief***, **Chapter 7 (answers for teacher reference)**.

- Use any common misconceptions or errors as whole group teaching points.

Homework

A. Determine Word Relationships

- Students complete **Homework: Lesson 9: Language Dive Practice: Word Relationships: *The Lightning Thief***, **Chapter 7**.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students should preread chapter 8 of *The Lightning Thief* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.
