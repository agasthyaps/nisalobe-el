Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- L.6.4a – Opening A: Students use contextual information from *The Lightning Thief* to determine the meaning of unknown vocabulary in the text.

- SL.6.1 – Work Time A: Students engage in a Think-Pair-Share, which requires them to compose their thoughts before engaging in collaborative discourse.

- RL.6.6 – Work Time B: Students use the Point of View anchor chart to analyze Percy’s point of view toward his teacher, Mr. Brunner. Students read excerpts from the text to examine how Percy feels about Mr. Brunner and track how Percy’s point of view develops and changes across chapters. Students participate in a Think-Pair-Share protocol to process and share their ideas.

- RL.6.6 – Closing and Assessment A: Students build on their understanding of point of view by identifying text evidence that reveals the narrator’s changing perspective. Students engage in a second QuickWrite, tracking the development of the narrator’s point of view toward one other character over the first two chapters, in preparation for the mid-unit assessment.

- In this lesson, the directions for routines that are repeated from previous lessons have been pared down and noted with “Repeated routine.” For the detailed outline of how to facilitate this part of the lesson, please refer back to previous lessons.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- To allow more time in class for in-depth discussions of the text, students should complete their initial reading of the chapter under focus for homework the night before.

- Challenge students to purposefully and strategically use the vocabulary they have been collecting in their vocabulary logs during the lesson discussion and in their written responses.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students read from the second chapter of *The Lightning Thief* and practiced their first QuickWrite, in which they determined the narrator’s point of view. Students are given a similar prompt for their second QuickWrite and build on their initial response by adding new information on how the narrator’s point of view has changed in chapter 2.

Support All Students

- Remind students that two of the learning targets in this lesson are the same as the previous lesson. Repetitive learning targets allow students multiple opportunities to practice a skill to achieve mastery.

- Students may be surprised, offended, confused, or upset by the difficult, sometimes verbally abusive relationship between Percy and his stepfather (i.e., calling Percy names, taking money from Percy, and demanding that Percy’s mother retrieve beer and food for him). Students may also react strongly to the description of the tragedies Percy’s mother has suffered (i.e., her parents died in a plane crash, her uncle died of cancer). Time for debriefing and reflection might help get these concerns out into the open so they can be addressed and tracked throughout the text.

- Note that chapter 3 of *The Lightning Thief* contains a significant amount of description; prepare visuals (e.g., images of a poker game, a ’78 Camaro, the beach at Montauk, a cyclops) to aid understanding, or encourage students to sketch what they are reading. ▲

- As with the previous lessons, consider how to organize the reading of *The Lightning Thief* in this lesson to meet the students’ needs. See recommendations in Lessons 2 and 3.

- To support ELLs, this lesson teaches strategies to decode unfamiliar vocabulary and facilitates supported activities for students to explore point of view. Discussion protocols, like Turn and Talk and Think-Pair-Share, as well as opportunities to read instructions aloud chorally, further support ELLs’ speaking abilities.

- ELLs may find it challenging to differentiate between unfamiliar vocabulary that is crucial for comprehension of the text and that which is less important and not worth the time to decipher. This is an important skill that ELLs will want to cultivate as they continue to add terms to their vocabulary logs across the module. Provide students with a few general questions they can use to determine which words they should focus on (e.g., Is the word unknown? Does the text use the word more than once? Without this word, is it impossible to understand the paragraph?).

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.B.6c, 6.I.B.7, and 6.I.C.12.

Assessment Guidance

- Monitor students as they analyze how the author develops Percy’s point of view toward Mr. Brunner in QuickWrite: Point of View: *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 2. Preselect several pieces of relevant text evidence to guide struggling students.

Down the Road

- Now that students have read a few chapters of *The Lightning Thief*, they may have questions about Greek mythology. In the next lesson, students build their knowledge of Greek mythology and its relevance today by reading an informational text on the topic and participating in a Language Dive.

- The Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart introduced in this lesson is referred to throughout this and all other modules. Students use the chart as a reference for reading narrative and informational texts, and strengthen their ability to read carefully and identify text details.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Strategies to Determine the Meaning of Unfamiliar Vocabulary – L.6.4a (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 4**.

- Using **equity sticks**, call on students to provide a definition or synonym for *funds* (money), and ask them to suggest the strategies they used to determine the meaning of the word. Listen for students to suggest context.

- See **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 4 (for teacher reference)**.

- Highlight the words *paychecks, money,* and *cash,* also in the posted excerpt. Ask:

“What do you notice about these words?” (They all have similar meanings and are related to money.)

“How do these words relate to the word *funds*?” (They mean the same thing and give clues to the meaning of the unfamiliar word.)

“How could you use these words help you to figure out the meaning of *funds*?”

- Add the strategy of using context clues to the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart**. Refer to **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** as necessary. Add *funds* to the **academic word wall**.

- Invite students to retrieve their **Unit 1 Lesson 3 homework, Unfamiliar Vocabulary: *The Lightning Thief***, **Chapter 2**, and select volunteers to share strategies they used to answer the unfamiliar vocabulary questions.

- As students share out, capture new strategies shared on the Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart. Refer to Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart (example for teacher reference) as necessary.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- If students do not understand many of the other words in the short passage of the entrance ticket (e.g., *paychecks*, *gambling*), they may feel unprepared or unable to complete the activity by determining the meaning of the word *funds*. Encourage students to use their dictionaries for now. Point out that efficient and thoughtful dictionary use is an important strategy for learning new words, and remind them that they will be also be learning other strategies during this unit.

Work Time

A. Read *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 3 Excerpt – SL.6.1 (15 minutes)

- Review the appropriate learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can find the gist of chapter 3 of *The Lightning Thief*.”

- Invite students to retrieve their copy of ***The Lightning Thief*** and reread the gist they recorded for chapter 2.

- Repeated routine: Read aloud the selected excerpt, using **Text Guide: *The Lightning Thief*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Refer to the following resources as appropriate to support this section of the lesson: **Gist Record: *The Lightning Thief*** **anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**, **vocabulary logs**, **chapter synopsis**, and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Excerpt: Chapter 3, starting on page 36 at “‘Thank you, Percy,’ my mom said. ‘Once we get to Montauk . . . ’” and ending at page 43 “ . . . Because where his feet should be, there were no feet. There were cloven hooves.”

- During reading, invite students to add any unfamiliar words to their vocabulary logs. Add any new words to the academic word wall and **domain-specific word wall** as applicable, and invite students to add translations in native languages. ▲

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What is the gist? What is this chapter mostly about?” (Responses will vary, but may include: Percy decapitates Medusa after she attacks him.)

- Invite a student to paraphrase the key points in more comprehensible language for those who need heavier support. ▲

- Model recording gist (key words, not full sentences) on a **sticky note**, and invite students to do the same, sticking them at the front of the chapter for quick reference.

Work Time

B. Analyze Point of View: *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 2 – RL.6.6 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can explain how the author develops Percy’s point of view toward Mr. Brunner in chapter 2 of *The Lightning Thief*.”

- Remind students of the **Point of View anchor chart**, and invite them to choral read the definition together. If needed, give students a minute to scan their Point of View anchor charts to remind themselves of relevant ideas and vocabulary. ▲

- Remind students that they began exploring point of view in *The Lightning Thief* in the previous lesson.

- Invite students to turn to page 2 and read along as the excerpt is read aloud, beginning at, “But Mr. Brunner, our Latin teacher, was leading this trip, so I had hopes” and ending at “ . . . I wouldn’t get in trouble.”

- Refer to the second column on the anchor chart. Turn and Talk:

“What was Percy’s point of view toward Mr. Brunner at this point in the novel?” (Percy likes Mr. Brunner as a person and a teacher and seems to admire him. He thinks that Mr. Brunner is “cool” because he tells stories and jokes and allows students to play games in class. Percy also thinks he’s a good teacher, as he says that Mr. Brunner is “the only teacher whose class didn’t put me to sleep.”)

- Focus students on the question in the final column, and invite them to read it aloud chorally:

“Development: How and why has Percy’s point of view changed? How does the author develop the point of view?”

- Think-Pair-Share:

“How do you know Percy’s point of view? How has the author conveyed this point of view? What is happening in this excerpt—thoughts, actions, speaking?” (through Percy’s thoughts)

“Which words and phrases help you to understand Percy’s point of view of Mr. Brunner in this excerpt?” (Student responses will vary, but may include: “cool,” “told stories and jokes,” “awesome,” “didn’t put me to sleep.”)

- Record student ideas in the Development column on the Point of View anchor chart. See **Point of View anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**.

- Invite students to turn to page 21 and read along as the excerpt is read aloud, beginning at, “The next afternoon . . . ,” and ending at, “But I was already gone.”

- Display and distribute the **QuickWrite: Point of View: *The Lightning Thief***, **Chapter 2**, and invite students to read the directions and prompt aloud chorally:

“From reading this excerpt, what is Percy’s point of view toward Mr. Brunner now?”

- Using the directions on the student handout, ensure students understand the parameters of a QuickWrite. Invite them to begin writing.

- Circulate to monitor and guide students. Pay attention to common misconceptions, and take note of a student who has composed an exemplary response.

- See **QuickWrite: Point of View: *The Lightning Thief***, **Chapter 2 (example for teacher reference)**.

- After 5 minutes, invite students to share out their ideas with the whole group. Listen for students to explain that Percy thinks Mr. Brunner is a hypocrite because, after telling him all year that he believes in him, he is now saying that he was destined to get kicked out. He is also disappointed with Mr. Brunner for saying Percy isn’t normal. Percy feels Mr. Brunner has let him down because he was Percy’s favorite teacher, yet now he is treating Percy poorly.

- If productive, use Goal 1 Conversation Cues to encourage students to clarify their ideas.

“So, do you mean \_\_\_\_\_?”

- Turn and Talk:

“How do you know Percy’s point of view? How has the author conveyed this point of view? What is happening in this excerpt—thoughts, actions, speaking?” (through Percy’s thoughts, speech, and actions)

“What does Percy leaving before Mr. Brunner had finished speaking tell you about what he thought of Mr. Brunner?” (Student responses will vary, but may include: he had lost respect for him.)

“Which words and phrases help you to understand Percy’s point of view toward Mr. Brunner in this excerpt?” (Student responses will vary, but may include: “embarrassed,” “favorite,” “telling me I couldn’t handle it,” ‘“believed in me,” “destined,” “kicked out,” “Thanks a lot, sir, for reminding me,” “already gone.”)

- Think-Pair-Share:

“How and why has Percy’s point of view toward Mr. Brunner changed in chapter 2?” (Student responses will vary, but may include: in chapter 1 Percy liked and admired Mr. Brunner; now he is disappointed in him and has lost respect for him.)

“How has the author developed Percy’s point of view in this chapter compared to the last?” (He has developed Percy’s point of view toward Mr. Brunner from positive to negative through Percy’s interpretation of what Mr. Brunner is saying to him.)

- Record student ideas in the Development column on the Point of View anchor chart. See Point of View anchor chart (example for teacher reference).

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time B, challenge ELLs who need lighter support to present their thinking about Percy’s point of view toward Mr. Brunner in multiple ways (e.g., *in prose, as well as in a bulleted outline or mental map*). Then, invite these students to share their thinking with ELLs who need heavier support and who may benefit from further explanation and/or visual support.

For Heavier Support

- The QuickWrite may be especially challenging for students with low writing ability. Emphasize that the QuickWrite is not meant to produce perfect writing; instead, it’s a tool for getting thoughts on paper quickly. If needed, invite ELLs who need heavier support to begin their QuickWrites with key words or phrases, rather than complete sentences.

Closing and Assessment

A. Reflect on Academic Mindsets (5 minutes)

- Incorporate reflection on and awareness of the following academic mindset: “I can succeed at this.”

- Ask:

“Reread the learning targets. With which do you think you are becoming successful? How do you know?” (Answers will vary.)

Homework

A. Determine Unfamiliar Vocabulary

- Students complete **Homework: Unfamiliar Vocabulary: *The Lightning Thief***, **Chapter 3**.
