Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 6

RL.6.4, L.6.4, W.6.10

(For Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, read the learning targets. Next, read the sentence from  
*The Lightning Thief*, and answer both questions.

“I saw a figure **lumbering** toward us on the shoulder of the road.” (48)

What does **lumbering** mean?

Answers will vary. Sample student response: moving in a heavy, clumsy way; the figure was not agile or light-footed, but awkward and hulking.

Do you think the narrator feels safe or in danger? Why?

Answers will vary. Sample student response: *lumbering* makes you think of something large and dangerous, and if the figure were running, it wouldn’t seem as scary.
