Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RL.6.4 – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket that requires identifying the meaning and connotation of a word as it is used in the text.

- RL.6.9 – Opening B: Students share and discuss their homework, which required that they compare and contrast literary (*The Lightning Thief*) and informational texts (“Why Ancient Greek Mythology Is Still Relevant Today”).

- RL.6.1 – Work Time A: Students read the next chapter of the text and find the gist. Students also unpack unfamiliar vocabulary and answer comprehension questions using inferences and evidence from text.

- L.6.4 – Closing and Assessment A: Students apply strategies for determining the meanings of unknown words to a homework assignment.

- In this lesson, students choose independent research reading texts. See Independent Reading Sample Plans (see the Tools page, http://eled.org/tools) for ideas on how to launch independent reading. If using already established routines for launching independent reading, in this lesson students choose a research reading text. The research reading that students complete for homework helps build both their vocabulary and knowledge pertaining to mythology, specifically its relevance today. By participating in this volume of reading over time, students develop a wide base of knowledge about the world and the words that help describe and make sense of it.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- The author uses figurative language extensively in chapter 4 of *The Lightning Thief*. Challenge students to find additional examples of similes and figures of speech beyond those studied by the whole class.

- To extend the discussion of relevance of Greek mythology, introduce students to the archetype of Hero’s Journey as detailed by Joseph Campbell. Invite them to chart the parts of *The Lightning Thief* that align to the Hero’s Journey so far.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students closely read an informational text about the relevance of Greek mythology and participated in a Language Dive. As students continue to read the novel, they gain more evidence to support the idea that Greek mythology is still relevant today.

Support All Students

- Chapter 4 of *The Lightning Thief* features a detailed scene in which Percy’s mother is captured and “dissolved” by a monster. Be alert and sensitive to the ways in which this scene may elicit student emotion.

- Within independent reading logs, provide sample sentence frames that students can use to record thoughts and ideas. Model a completed reading log as well to acquaint students with the end product of their independent reading. ▲

- Ensure that students are aware of the value and purpose of the independent research reading assignment. Provide students an opportunity to voice concerns about or identify possible challenges of the independent research reading assignment. Do so in a way that begets a response (e.g., instead of “Does anyone have any concerns about this assignment?” try “What are our concerns about this assignment?”).

- To support ELLs, this lesson continues to prioritize vocabulary development and prepares students to locate a research reading text that they will read independently. Independent research reading is meant to help students develop a deeper understanding of the topics they explore in class. This activity supports all students, but is especially useful for ELLs, as reading multiple texts on the same topic facilitates natural opportunities for students to encounter unfamiliar vocabulary words more than once, across texts. Repeated exposure to new words is critical for ELLs’ vocabulary development.

- ELLs may find it challenging to begin an independent research reading assignment, especially if they already feel overwhelmed by the amount of reading they complete in class. Encourage ELLs to select texts that are simpler than the texts they read in class, even if these feel “easy” for them. Engaging with simpler texts when reading independently both supports ELLs’ reading fluency and increases their confidence. Also, create opportunities for students to acknowledge and celebrate their developing reading abilities, evident through their completion of both literary and informational texts in class.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standard 6.I.C.10b.

Assessment Guidance

- Circulate and monitor as students share their QuickWrite: Connections between *The Lightning Thief* and “Why Ancient Greek Mythology Is Still Relevant Today.” Listen for common misconceptions, and address them with the whole class. Connect this QuickWrite back to the module guiding questions.

- The Accountable Research Reading assignment launched in this lesson continues throughout the rest of the module. Students read consistently each night for 20 minutes and answer a prompt of their choosing.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students continue in their anchor text, reading from chapter 5 of *The Lightning Thief* and analyzing how the author develops the narrator’s point of view.

- The independent reading journals introduced in this lesson are referred to throughout this and the subsequent modules. Students have an opportunity to share their research reading in Unit 2, Lesson 5.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RL.6.4 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 6**.

- See **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 6 (for teacher reference)**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

- With students, use the vocabulary strategies on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart** to deconstruct the phrase *research reading* (reading books on the topic to find out more information). Record on the **domain-specific word wall** with translations in home languages, where appropriate, and invite students to record words in their **vocabulary logs**.

Opening

B. Share QuickWrite – RL.6.9 (5 minutes)

- With an elbow partner, invite students to read aloud their **QuickWrite: Connections between *The Lightning Thief*** **and “Why Ancient Greek Mythology Is Still Relevant Today”** (from Unit 1 homework).

- Direct students to share one star (something the writer did well) and one step (something the writer could improve upon) with their partner. Remind students of the habits of character respect and empathy, as needed.

- If some ELLs are feeling uncertain about their performance on the homework, allow them to use their time with their partner to share questions, rather than insights. ▲

- Refer to the **QuickWrite: Connections between *The Lightning Thief*** **and “Why Ancient Greek Mythology Is Still Relevant Today” (example for teacher reference)** for guidance.

Work Time

A. Read *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 4 Excerpt – RL.6.1 (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Read aloud the selected excerpt, using the **Text Guide: *The Lightning Thief*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Refer to the following resources as appropriate to support this section of the lesson: **Gist Record: *The Lightning Thief*** **anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**, vocabulary logs, **chapter synopsis**, and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Excerpt: Chapter 4 starting at page 48 “‘Climb out the passenger’s side!’ my mother told me . . . ” and ending at page 56 “‘ . . . Silence, Annabeth,’ the man said. ‘He’s still conscious. Bring him inside.’”

- Gist: Percy kills the minotaur that killed his mother.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time A, encourage ELLs to try a new reading approach (e.g., *reading independently if they often read in groups or with support, reading silently if they often read aloud*), in order to improve their flexibility and independence as readers. Relatedly, if students usually read their anchor texts in a pair or group with classmates of a more advanced proficiency level, change partners so students are placed in pairs of similar proficiency.

For Heavier Support

N/A

Work Time

B. Launch Independent Research Reading (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can select a research reading text that I want to read.”

- Launch independent reading. There is a suggested independent reading launch in the **Independent Reading Sample Plans**. Urge students to choose a text before the end of the lesson.

- At the end of 5 minutes, distribute **independent reading journals**.

- Tell students they will use this journal to log their independent reading, both choice and research reading, and to answer reading prompts.

- Display the independent reading pages of the **Unit 1 Homework Resources (for families)**, and focus students on the information they need to record using the example on the same page.

- Model how to log independent reading without the prompt. Explain that they will log their research reading in the front of the book and choice reading in the back. Ensure that students understand the difference between independent research reading (topical texts) and choice reading (any texts they want to read).

- Explain that they will respond to a prompt for homework in the front of their journals, and show students where to find the prompts in the homework resources document.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time B, provide ELLs with a short list of websites they may want to use to locate an appropriate independent research reading text.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time B, provide ELLs with a short list of prescreened, level-appropriate options, with titles and short synopses, from which they can choose the text they want.

Closing and Assessment

A. Reflect on Habits of Character (5 minutes)

- Direct students’ attention to **the Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Read aloud the habit of character recorded:

“I behave with integrity: This means I do the right thing even when it is hard.”

- Turn and Talk:

“What does *integrity* mean, in your own words?” (Responses will vary.)

“What does integrity look like? What might you see when someone is showing integrity?” (Responses will vary.)

“What does integrity sound like? What might you hear when someone is showing integrity?” (Responses will vary.)

“How will you show integrity while working on your independent research reading?” (Responses will vary. Possible response: I will keep up with my reading, even though it won’t be checked every day.)

- As students share, record their responses in the appropriate column on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**. See **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**.

Homework

A. Determine Unfamiliar Vocabulary

- Students complete **Homework: Unfamiliar Vocabulary: *The Lightning Thief***, **Chapter 4**.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their independent reading journal.
