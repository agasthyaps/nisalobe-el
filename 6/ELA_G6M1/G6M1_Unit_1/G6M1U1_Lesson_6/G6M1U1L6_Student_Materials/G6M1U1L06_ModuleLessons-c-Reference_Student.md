Synopsis: *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 4

**Name:** **Date:**

- Sally, Grover, and Percy race along dark roads during a storm to escape whatever is chasing Percy. Grover quickly tries to fill Percy in, explaining that Mrs. Dodds was a monster and Grover has been assigned to protect Percy.

- The car swerves into a ditch. Sally pleads with Percy to run, but Percy stubbornly refuses to leave Sally and Grover, who was knocked unconscious by the car crash.

- Percy and Sally stumble uphill with Grover, trying to get to the property line of the camp, when Percy recognizes that it’s a minotaur chasing them.

- The minotaur charges. Percy and Sally manage to avoid the monster.

- The minotaur charges again, but this time it grabs ahold of Sally Jackson, squeezes her neck, and she disappears in a flash of golden light.

- Percy has a surge of furious energy, and he fights the minotaur. Percy rips off the minotaur’s horn and stabs it. The minotaur disintegrates.

- Percy grabs Grover and hauls him down the hill to the porch of a farmhouse in the valley of the hill.

- Percy collapses and, before losing consciousness, sees a man with a familiar face and a blond girl.
