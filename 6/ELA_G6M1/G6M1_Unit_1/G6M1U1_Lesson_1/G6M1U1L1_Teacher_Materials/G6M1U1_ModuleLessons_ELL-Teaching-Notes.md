Teaching Notes for Unit 1

Prioritize Lessons for Classrooms with Many English Language Learners

To prepare for the Unit 1 assessments, prioritize and expand instruction in Lesson 3, which introduces the topic of point of view and Lesson 4, which first teaches strategies for determining the meaning of unknown vocabulary. The Language Dives of Lessons 5, 9, and 10 support reading abilities for students at all proficiency levels though are particularly critical for ELLs, as these approaches accelerate language development through a close look at structure and vocabulary.

Language Dives

In Lesson 5, students are introduced to their first Language Dive, which invites them to interpret unknown academic words using a sentence from an informational text. A two-day Language Dive, with a sentence from *The Lightning Thief*, will take place over Lessons 9 and 10 and help students better understand word relationships and connotations. A Language Dive empowers students to analyze, understand, and use the language of academic sentences, which can often seem opaque to students. During a Language Dive, slow down for 10–20 minutes to examine the meaning, purpose, and structure of a compelling sentence from a complex text, model, learning target, checklist, or rubric included in the curriculum. This process invites students to unpack complex syntax, or “academic phrases,” as a way to build both literacy and habits of mind. Students then apply their understanding of language structure as they work toward the assessments and performance task. Through the Language Dive’s engaging Deconstruct-Reconstruct-Practice routine, students play with “chunks” of the sentence, interpreting them, rearranging them, and using them to talk about their own lives or lesson content. As a result of paying close attention to how language works, all students begin to acquire the necessary facility with academic English, and ELLs foster their overall language ability. A consistent Language Dive routine is critical in helping all students learn how to decipher complex sentences and write their own.

Most Language Dives implicitly address a wide range of Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening, and Language standards. Once comfortable with Language Dives, supplement the focus standards in a particular Language Dive with additional standards to meet their students’ needs. Note that the Rationale section of each Language Dive also identifies supporting standards that are explicitly addressed but are not the main focus of the Language Dive.

Note: Some responses to questions in the Language Dive indicate only that “Responses will vary.” Like one of the larger goals of Language Dives, “Responses will vary” is intended to suggest that students should be encouraged to grapple with questions and ideas, develop interest and participation, and not be immediately steered toward “correct” responses. Indeed, even when correct responses are provided, continue to invite a culture of inquiry and grappling.

Diversity and Inclusion

Investigate the routines, practices, rituals, beliefs, norms, and experiences that are important to ELLs and their families. Integrate this background into the classroom as students engage with texts. Consider the values and narratives embedded in class texts, and try to anticipate their relevance to ELLs. Note that *The Lightning Thief*, though a compelling and popular story, presents predominantly Western European and American perspectives. Acknowledgment in the text of the contributions of other non-Western civilizations and histories is limited. Be sensitive and alert to the ways in which explicit promotion of Western civilization and American culture within the text could feel alienating for some students. Additionally, the text interprets the protagonist’s diagnosed hyperactivity and reading difficulties as consequences of his being the son of a Greek god. Anticipate ways in which the characterization of these behavioral and academic needs could feel trivializing to students who face similar challenges. Challenge students to identify and interrogate the points of view and language of the author and narrator. Encourage and welcome critical questions, and guide students toward awareness and empathy. Foster inclusive action by creating space for students to express their feelings about sensitive issues or content embedded in the text(s), knowing that these discussions may help create equity, amplify student voices, or unearth trauma. Increase inclusivity by investigating myths from other cultures, particularly those from students’ home cultures, and share them with students. *The Lightning Thief* includes some Greek language; if any students are Greek speakers, invite them to be a voluntary language resource. Consult with a guidance counselor, school social worker, or ESL teacher for further investigation of diversity and inclusion.

Conversation Cues

Encourage productive and equitable conversation with Conversation Cues, which are questions to ask students that help achieve four goals:

- (Goal 1) encourage all students to talk and be understood;

- (Goal 2) listen carefully to one another and seek to understand;

- (Goal 3) deepen thinking; and

- (Goal 4) think with others to expand the conversation (adapted from Michaels, Sarah and O’Connor, Cathy*. Talk Science Primer*. TERC, 2012. http://inquiryproject.terc.edu/shared/pd/TalkScience_Primer.pdf. Based on Chapin, S., O’Connor, C., and Anderson, N. *Classroom Discussions: Using Math Talk to Help Students Learn, Grades K–6. Second Edition*. Math Solutions Publications, 2009).

Refer to the Tools Page (http://eled.org/tools) for the complete set of cues. Goal 1 Conversation Cues are introduced in Lesson 1, and suggestions for integrating Conversation Cues into instruction are presented across lessons. For ELLs, Conversation Cues are especially critical because they improve language processing abilities and increase engagement and participation.

Strategic Grouping

Students work in pairs and small groups to analyze texts and prepare for text-based discussions. While reading the anchor text in class, students can read independently, in pairs or small groups, or as a full class. In earlier lessons, match ELLs with a partner who has greater language proficiency. The conversations and reading support that occur as a result of such strategic pairing will greatly serve the language development of both partners. In later lessons, cultivate ELLs’ autonomy and flexibility by encouraging them to vary their reading habits.

Analyze Point of View

In Lesson 3, students will be introduced to the concept of point of view. In Lessons 4–10, in preparation for the mid-unit assessment of Lesson 11, students will develop and practice strategies to analyze the points of view of narrator and author. The Point of View anchor chart will help ELLs in navigating this work. Offer deeper support by creating an additional anchor chart that tracks the key traits and experiences of characters throughout the novel.

Compare Literary and Informational Texts

Over the course of Unit 1, students will read strategically selected excerpts of twelve chapters of *The Lightning Thief*. This literary text facilitates engaging exploration of narrator’s and author’s point(s) of view in Lessons 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, and 10, and of figurative language in Lessons 7 and 8. A close read of an informational text in Lesson 5 acquaints students with more academic prose and allows them to identify links across the content and language of both text types. Inclusion of both literary and informational texts facilitates student exposure to a range of grammar, discourse, and sociolinguistic structures, supporting the development of stronger, more confident readers with more versatile reading abilities.

Text-Based Discussions

For the end of unit assessment in Lessons 15–16, students will participate in a text-based discussion, during which they will have the opportunity to explore how the main character and narrator of *The Lightning Thief* has changed in response to events in the plot. In preparation for the discussion, students will, in Lesson 14, contribute collaboratively to a note-catcher that helps them organize and synthesize their ideas. This format is ideal for language development, as it invites students to orally negotiate their ideas with other students, pushing them to change their language to be more comprehensible.

Differentiated Note-Catchers

Differentiated note-catchers are available for ELLs and other students who would benefit from an increased level of support. These resources have been modified for the purposes of creating accessibility to content and concepts and supporting language development. Depending upon the task being carried out with a note-catcher, images, selected response options, answer banks, sentence frames, or model responses have been embedded to guide students’ thinking without compromising a focus on standards and the skills that students are developing and applying to meet them.

Celebration

Celebrate the courage, enthusiasm, diversity, and bilingual assets that ELLs bring to the classroom. Additionally, students can celebrate their successful attempts at communication and their ability to extend and enhance the discussions.
