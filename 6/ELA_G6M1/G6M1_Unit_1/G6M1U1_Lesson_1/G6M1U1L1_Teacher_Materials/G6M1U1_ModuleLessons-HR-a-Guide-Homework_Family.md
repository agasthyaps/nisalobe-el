![](media/image1.png) Guiding Questions and Big Ideas

What is mythology, and what is the value of studying mythology from other cultures?

- *A collection of stories featuring traditional figures that explain natural phenomena and convey the values of the culture*

- *Studying stories from other cultures introduces alternative perspectives and amplifies one’s worldview.*

Why have stories from Greek mythology remained popular?

- *They teach themes that are still relevant.*

- *They contain figures whose attributes are valued across time.*

- *They ask questions about the human condition.*

- *They remain relatable because they can be reimagined to fit different environments and time periods.*

How does point of view change with experience?

- *A narrator’s or character’s understanding of an experience changes depending on one’s point of view.*

- *Examining multiple points of view supports a more complex understanding of our own and others’ choices and beliefs.*

What will your student be doing at school?

This unit is designed to help students build knowledge about Greek mythology while simultaneously developing their ability to read a challenging text closely by analyzing the narrator’s point of view in the novel *Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief* by Rick Riordan. Students read this novel in conjunction with selected stories from Greek mythology and articles addressing the relevance and influence of these ancient stories today. Students will examine the author develops a character’s point of view over the course of a novel as well as how their own perspectives can evolve.

In the second half of the unit, students participate in a discussion about how the main character responds to challenges and what those reactions indicate about his character.

The Language standard that students focus on in this unit is determining or clarifying the meanings of unknown and multiple-meaning words by choosing flexibly from a range of strategies.

Working to become ethical people is the habit of character emphasized in this unit. These are the specific skills on which students will focus:

- I show respect. This means I appreciate the abilities, qualities, and achievements of others and treat myself, others, and the environment with care.

- I show empathy. This means I understand and share or take into account the feelings, situation, or attitude of others.

- I behave with integrity. This means I am honest and do the right thing, even when it’s difficult, because it is the right thing to do.

- I show compassion. This means I notice when others are sad or upset and try to help them.

How can you support your student at home?

Share traditional stories from your culture or heritage with your student. Ask your student about the lessons that these stories were meant to teach and how those messages might still be relevant today.

Explain how your personal point of view has changed since you were the age of your student.

Watch films and research on the internet with your student to find out more about Greek mythology. The novel your student is studying references a number of different mythological figures (e.g., heroes, gods and goddesses, monsters). Build background knowledge on this topic by discovering together the details of the figures named in the novel.

Ask your student to explain the difference between academic and domain-specific vocabulary and to offer you examples. Share some examples of domain-specific terms from your occupation or hobby with your student.

Read chapter books with your student and discuss how each chapter fits into the overall structure of the novel using the key below:

**Key**

- **exposition:** beginning of the story describing how things are before the action begins

- **rising action:** series of conflicts and crises in the story that builds towards the climax

- **climax:** the turning point, when something important happens that changes the direction of the story

- **falling action:** the action that happens after the climax and starts to guide the story toward the resolution

- **resolution:** the end of the story tying everything together

Unit 1: Homework

In Lessons 2–16, homework handouts focus on determining the meanings of unfamiliar words using context and reference materials, as well as answering text-dependent questions about the development of plot and characters from the anchor text, *Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief*. Time limitations do not allow for entire chapters of the novel to be read during class; students will be asked to preread a chapter for homework the night before it is studied in class. Reading from the anchor text will be balanced with research reading, which is used to deepen students’ background knowledge about the topic of the module.

**Research reading:** Your student is expected to independently research the topic of study in this module, Greek mythology, by reading topic-related books of his or her choice. Research reading will be assigned on evenings when students are not already reading the anchor text (explained above). Students will be expected to read for approximately 20 minutes <u>each da</u>y and respond to a prompt of choice in the <u>front</u> of the independent reading journal. These are usually books your student will bring home from school; however, they may be topic-related books chosen by the student at the public or home library. Prompts for independent reading can be found in the homework materials provided.

**Choice reading:** If your student would also like to independently read and respond to a book of free choice, he or she may use the <u>back</u> of the independent reading journal. Prompts for independent reading can be found in the homework materials provided.

Vocabulary Logs

Students record new vocabulary in vocabulary logs and mark academic vocabulary with a symbol, for example, a star:

- **Academic vocabulary:** words you might find in informational texts on many different topics. For example, the words *evidence* and *rationale* are words that could be found in books on any topic.

- **Domain-specific vocabulary:** words about a particular topic. For example, the words *tadpoles, frogspawn,* and *amphibian* are some that would be found on the topic of frogs.

Independent Reading

**Directions:** Remember to record responses to research reading in the front of your independent reading journal and responses to choice reading in the back. Try to choose a different prompt each time.

Record any new vocabulary in your vocabulary log. Underline vocabulary found during independent reading.

Record:

- Date

- Title and author of your reading book

- Pages you have read

- Prompt

- Response

Example:

<u>Date:</u> 10/13/2020

<u>Book Title and Author:</u> *The Lightning Thief* by Rick Riordan

<u>Pages Read:</u> 242–257

<u>Prompt:</u> How does Grover show characteristics of a hero?

<u>Response:</u> Grover can be described as a hero because he shows compassion. In chapter 16 of *The Lightning Thief*, the trio comes upon an animal transport to a zoo. The animals have been neglected; they are starving, dirty, thirsty, and sad. Grover shows compassion by speaking to them, calming them down, and freeing them from captivity. He even uses his powers as a satyr to give them a blessing, a “satyr’s sanctuary,” ensuring that they will find water, food, shade, and safety in the wild. Showing compassion for those who are less fortunate is a characteristic of heroes.

Consider using the following independent reading prompts.[^1]

- How does this text add to your understanding of one of the module guiding questions?

- How does (character) show characteristics of a hero?

- How does (character) change his or her point of view over the course of the plot?

- What strategy does (character) use to achieve success?

- How does (character) grow and change?

- If you were (character), what would you do differently?

- If the text contains a myth, what is the purpose of the myth?

- Which habits of character are demonstrated in the text? Explain.

- Which habits of character are <u>not</u> demonstrated in the text? Explain.

- Record two or three facts in your own words that you learned from the text.

- Summarize your research reading today in no more than five sentences.

- What theme is present in the text you read? Give text details that convey that theme.

- What questions do you have about the topic after reading?

- Choose one new word from your reading today and analyze it on a vocabulary square:

| Definition in your own words                  | Synonyms (words with the same meaning) |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Words with the same affix or root             | Sketch                                 |
| Translation in home language (if appropriate) |                                        |

Vocabulary

**Directions:** In the classroom, you have been recording words from your texts in your vocabulary log. Throughout this unit, you have been research reading topic-related books at home to build your knowledge of mythology and recording words in your independent reading journal.

Choose a word from your research reading or from a text you’ve read in class and add the word to your vocabulary log. Try to choose a different word to add and to practice a different vocabulary strategy each time. For each word, be sure to add the following:

1.  The definition, or meaning, of the word

<!-- -->

3.  The vocabulary strategy you used to figure out the meaning of the word

4.  A sketch or diagram that helps you to better understand the meaning of the word

Vocabulary Strategies

As a reminder, the vocabulary strategies we’ve been working on in class are:

- Context: read the sentence around the word.

- Look at the affixes for clues.

- Look at the root of the word for clues.

- Use a dictionary.

- Discuss the word with another person (after attempting some of the above strategies).

[^1]: Some of the prompts will not be appropriate for the text students are reading. Invite students to choose a prompt that works for the text they have just read.
