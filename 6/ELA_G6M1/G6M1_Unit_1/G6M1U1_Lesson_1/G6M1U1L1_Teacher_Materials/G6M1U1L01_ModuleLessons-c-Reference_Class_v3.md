“You shall go west, and face the god who has turned. You shall find what was stolen, and see it safely returned. You shall be betrayed by one who calls you a friend. And you shall fail to save what matters most in the end.” (141)

Riordan, Rick. *Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief*. Disney Press, 2005.

Resource 4

Athena was jealous of Medusa’s beauty and of Poseidon’s love for her. Envious and spiteful, Athena punished Medusa in a most terrible manner. Every wavy lock of Medusa’s beautiful hair was changed into a venomous snake. Her once gentle, loving eyes became bloodshot, furious orbs. Her rosy cheeks took on the greenish hue of death. Her smile, which had before caused all to love her, became a hideous grinning mask.  Too horrible for human eyes to bear, Medusa’s visage now caused all who looked upon her to turn to stone.

“Some might wonder what the point is to just passing down stories—stories that were made up and were in no way true but that was the beauty of Greek mythology in ancient times. They became the perfect way to impart lessons without being dull or boring.”
