Synopsis: *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 1

**Name:** **Date:**

- Percy Jackson is a twelve-year-old student at Yancy Academy, a private boarding school for troubled kids.

- Percy’s class, in addition to two teachers, Mr. Brunner and Mrs. Dodds, is taking a field trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art to look at ancient Greek and Roman artifacts.

- During lunch, Nancy dumps her lunch on Grover’s lap. The next moment, Nancy is sitting in the fountain screaming that Percy pushed her in.

- Mrs. Dodds appears out of nowhere and beckons Percy to follow her. Percy and Mrs. Dodds are alone in the gallery when she transforms into an evil winged creature.

- Suddenly Mr. Brunner appears and tosses a pen to Percy.

- Percy catches the pen, but the pen has changed into a sword.

- Mrs. Dodds attacks Percy. He swings the sword; it makes contact with Mrs. Dodds, and she vaporizes.

- Percy goes back outside and inquires about Mrs. Dodds to Grover and Mr. Brunner. Both insist they have no idea who Percy is talking about.
