Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- SL.6.1 – Work Time A: Students engage in a Think-Pair-Share, which requires them to compose their thoughts before engaging in collaborative discourse.

- L.6.4c – Work Time B: Students set up and begin to collect unfamiliar academic and domain-specific vocabulary in their vocabulary logs. Students use dictionaries to clarify the precise meaning and/or part of speech of words they have reviewed in the first two lessons.

- L.6.4d – Work Time B: Students practice inferring the meanings of unknown words before verifying their preliminary definitions with a dictionary.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become ethical people by showing respect and empathy as they share reflections on the guiding questions in Opening B. This is not mandatory—students share their reflections only if they want to do so. It is important to be sensitive to students’ and families’ feelings and experiences of myths and religious figures, and to acknowledge that these feelings and experiences may differ greatly. The main point students should understand by the end of this module is that a culture’s mythology teaches themes that are still relevant, contains figures whose attributes are valued across time, and asks questions about the human condition. The novel makes clear that the stories and figures of Greek mythology remain relatable because they can be reimagined to fit different environments and time periods.

- In these lessons, students will read excerpts of the anchor text rather than complete chapters to ensure sufficient time for students to think and respond to the text. If taking their texts home is an option, encourage students to preread the next chapter for homework. If there is extended time for language arts, reading the entire chapter in class might be an option. A synopsis is provided for each chapter to help support students’ understanding of the main events of a chapter and to fill in their knowledge when they are reading only an excerpt. It is important to understand and to convey to students that the synopsis is not the same thing as a summary of the text, which is a skill that will be built in this module and expanded upon in later modules.

- Consider reading aloud *The Lightning Thief* for these first lessons to ensure student comprehension, engagement, and enjoyment of the text. Once students build capacity, determine how they can take over responsibility for reading during class. Alternatives to read-alouds include: another fluent reader (including students or an audiobook) reads aloud to the whole class, small groups, triads, or pairs; individuals read silently; or a combination of any of these.

- Students are introduced to academic mindsets in the Closing and Assessment of this lesson. Academic mindsets refer to the motivational components that influence a student’s desire and will to engage in learning. Research shows that academic mindsets are a better predictor of student success than any other determining factor. Students will develop an understanding of all four as the module progresses. The Academic Mindsets are:

- I belong in this academic community.

- I can succeed at this.

- My ability and competence grow with my effort.

- This work has value for me.

- Consider making these into an anchor chart for easy reference.

- At the end of the lesson, distribute the Homework Resources, and review the format of the document and this lesson’s specific assignment with students.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- This unit is designed to focus on specific excerpts from the text during class so as to provide time for analysis. To cover the entire text, encourage students to read each chapter in its entirety outside of class time.

- Challenge students to create original sentences using their newly acquired vocabulary, while adding context clues to demonstrate their understanding of the definition.

- While looking up definitions, draw students’ attention to the etymology of the vocabulary, noting especially those words that include a Greek root.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students were introduced to the module topic by looking at resources in the Infer the Topic protocol. In this lesson, they formally begin to explore the topic by launching the novel *The Lightning Thief*.

Support All Students

- Note there are differentiated versions of the entrance ticket used in Opening A and the Academic and Domain-Specific Vocabulary form used in Work Time B in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Students may be surprised, offended, confused, or upset by the way Percy uses some terms to describe himself (e.g., “troubled,” “mental-case”), especially at the start of the novel before they have a sense of his personality, what he means by some of them (e.g., “half-blood”), and then sense that he is generally using them self-deprecatingly. Time for debriefing and reflection might help get these concerns out into the open so they can be addressed and tracked throughout the text.

- ELLs may have smaller English vocabularies and thus will encounter (and need to log) a higher number of unknown words. Due to limitations in vocabulary knowledge, ELLs may be less equipped to differentiate among unknown words that are critical for comprehension of the text and those that are less critical. To ensure that they are focusing on vocabulary items important for comprehension, provide ELLs a short list of “target” unknown words to discern their meanings, rather than expecting them to apply strategies to any unknown word they encounter. ▲

- Ensure that students can both see and hear the instructions throughout this lesson and all others.

- To support ELLs, this lesson cultivates an environment of empathy and respect for diverse perspectives through the Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart; equips students with strategies for describing the gist of their anchor text; offers strategic excerpts from the anchor text to better help students complete and comprehend reading in class; establishes a log that can help students investigate new vocabulary systematically; and introduces summaries for each chapter of *The Lightning Thief* that students can reference as needed.

- Although the chapter has been excerpted, ELLs may still find it challenging to read and identify the gist of chapter 1 of *The Lightning Thief* in the allotted time. Encourage students to read collaboratively with support from you or a more proficient classmate.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.B.6 and 6.I.C.10b.

Assessment Guidance

- Monitor students as they make their initial entries into their vocabulary logs, ensuring they are recording correct definitions and that they understand the difference between academic and domain-specific vocabulary. Assure students who are still confused that they will have plenty of future opportunities to gather more examples of each type of vocabulary.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue reading from *The Lightning Thief*, finding the gist of chapter 2, and thinking about how the author develops the point of view of the narrator.

- The vocabulary log introduced in this lesson will be referred to throughout the module.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare

- Vocabulary logs. The vocabulary log could be a notebook in which students glue the forms provided or a folder with several copies of the vocabulary forms clipped into the fasteners. Students will continue to use these logs throughout the year and will only need new ones when they have run out of space; however, to distinguish between the topics they study in each module, they will need to flag where one module ends and a new one begins. If logs are prepared for students in advance, time will not be used in the lesson for students to prepare them.

- Preread chapter 1 in *The Lightning Thief* to identify words or plot points that may challenge students.

- Prepare copies of handouts for students, including entrance ticket (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Closing and Assessment A: Vocabulary logs could be kept online, for example, on a Google Sheet.

- Work Time B: Allow students to use an online dictionary to look up their inferred definitions.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.6.10 (5 minutes)

- As students enter the classroom, distribute **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 2** or **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 2** ▲, and allow time for students to record their responses.

- Turn and Talk:

“What one word sticks out from the three learning targets as being the most important? Why?”

- Listen for a few exemplary responses to share with the whole class.

- Ask:

“What trends do you notice in your peers’ responses? Why might those same words be chosen repeatedly?” (Responses will vary, but will likely include: those are the words that best indicate what exactly we will be learning and what goals we will be working toward.)

- Direct students’ attention to the posted learning targets, and select a volunteer to read them aloud:

“I can show empathy and respect as I listen to my classmates.”

“I can find the gist of chapter 1 of *The Lightning Thief*.”

“I can determine the difference between academic and domain-specific vocabulary.”

- Focus students on the word *gist*. Use **equity sticks** to select students to share what they think it means. If they don’t know the meaning, share the strategies they could use to determine the meaning (context or dictionary). Support pronunciation by having students chorally repeat the word *gist*, and notice some of its sound properties (e.g., one syllable; a *-st* consonant cluster). ▲

- With students’ support, record the meaning of the word on the **academic word wall** with translations in students’ home languages (what the text is mostly about). Write synonyms or sketch a visual above each key term to scaffold students’ understanding. ▲

- Remind students that they did an in-depth discussion of the word *respect* in the previous lesson. Students may also point out the term *domain-specific*; explain that they will examine this term during Work Time C.

- Turn and Talk:

“What do you think you will be doing in this lesson based on these learning targets?” (reading the first chapter of the novel, determining what it is mostly about, and focusing on vocabulary)

“Why are we doing this? How is it meaningful to you? How will it help you to be successful?” (We will practice determining the most important parts of a new text and growing our vocabulary. These are skills we can use in all subject areas.)

Opening

B. Reflect on the Module Guiding Questions (5 minutes)

- Remind students that in the previous lesson they were introduced to the guiding questions for the module. Invite students to reread the **Module Guiding Questions anchor chart**.

- Explain that not all students will like Greek mythology or will have had positive experiences with religious references. Additionally, students may feel uncomfortable with the idea of Greek gods if acknowledgment of other deities goes against their religious beliefs. Create a safe space for students to express these views. Ensure students understand that it is okay to have different opinions.

- Remind students that for homework they were asked to reflect on what those guiding questions mean to them and how they feel about them. Sharing their reflections will be done in a respectful and empathetic environment.

- Focus students on the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Read aloud the habit of character recorded:

“I show empathy. This means I understand and I share or take into account the feelings, situation, or attitude of others.”

- Turn and Talk:

“Using the anchor chart as a guide, what does *empathy* mean, in your own words?” (thinking about how others might feel)

- Use the Think-Pair-Share protocol to discuss their ideas with a partner:

“What does *empathy* look like? What might you see when someone is showing *empathy* to someone else?”

“What does *empathy* sound like? What might you hear when someone is showing *empathy* to someone else?”

- See **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**.

- With empathy and respect in mind, invite any students who would like to do so to share their reflections with the whole group. This must be voluntary—if no one wants to share, that is okay.

Work Time

A. Read *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 1 Excerpt – SL.6.1 (20 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can find the gist of chapter 1 of *The Lightning Thief*.”

- Invite students to retrieve their copy of ***The Lightning Thief***, and remind them of what they thought the text might be about.

- Explain that students will read only excerpts from the anchor text rather than complete chapters to ensure sufficient time for students to think and respond to the text. Consider inviting students who would like to read the rest of the chapter to do so for homework. If there is extended time for language arts, reading the entire chapter might be an option.

- Read aloud the selected excerpt, using the **Text Guide: *The Lightning Thief*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. As you read, students follow along, reading silently. Note that while students may read in small groups or individually in future lessons, students will benefit from this initial introduction to the text as a whole class.

- Excerpt: Chapter 1 starting at page 8 “The class gathered on the front steps of the museum . . . ” and ending at page 15 “ . . . Are you feeling alright?”

- Think-Pair-Share:

“What is the gist? What is this chapter mostly about?” Refer to the **Gist Record: *The Lightning Thief*** **anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** for guidance. (Responses will vary, but may include: Percy is “troubled,” dyslexic, and a demigod. Percy’s math teacher turns into a winged monster and attacks him. His Latin teacher and a friend who saw the attack act as if nothing happened.)

- Invite a student to paraphrase the key points in more comprehensible language for those who need heavier support. ▲

- Model recording gist (key words, not full sentences) on a **sticky note**, and invite students to do the same, sticking them at the front of the chapter for quick reference. Students will also benefit from adding the chapter number and their initials on the sticky note for easier materials management.

- Remind students that their goal is to understand what the story is mostly about, and it is okay if there are parts they don’t quite understand yet.

- Use the **Synopsis: *The Lightning Thief***, **Chapter 1** to review and note key details for the entire chapter. This will help to complete students’ understanding of the events of this chapter, especially if they are not able to complete the reading of the full chapter.

- Give students 1 minute to silently reflect on the text. Encourage them to consider how the chapter made them feel. They can write or sketch, or just sit and think. If students need additional support, provide a few examples of possible feelings (e.g., confused, excited, curious) they may have experienced after reading from chapter 1. ELLs can then choose one of the feelings and draw it or write about it in more detail. ▲

- Direct students’ attention to the Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart, and review respect and empathy as needed before inviting students to share their reflections if they choose.

- Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target, using a checking for understanding technique—for example, Thumb-O-Meter. Scan student responses, and make a note of students who might need support. Check in with them moving forward.

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time A, challenge students to compare the gists they have written to the provided summaries of chapter 1. Encourage students to note differences in style and content. In pairs, students can speculate about the content of the chapter beyond the excerpts. This exercise will increase students’ engagement in their own reading and heighten the extent to which they notice difference.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time A, highlight key portions of chapter 1 or provide students with a few simple guiding questions (e.g., *Who is Percy Jackson? What does he do? Whom does he talk to?*). These supports will hone student attention to more important parts of the chapter.

Work Time

B. Launch Vocabulary Logs – L.6.4 (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can determine the difference between academic and domain-specific vocabulary.”

- Distribute **vocabulary logs** and several copies of the **Academic and Domain-Specific Vocabulary form** or **Academic and Domain-Specific Vocabulary form** ▲. Using **glue sticks**, direct students to add their vocabulary forms into their logs (see In Advance section).

- Invite students to read through the definitions of *academic vocabulary* and *domain-specific vocabulary* at the top of the vocabulary form.

- Invite students to record the words reviewed so far in the first two lessons (*infer, notice, wonder, respect, mythology, gist,* and *empathy*) in the first column of their vocabulary logs.

- Move students into partnerships. Model filling in the other three columns for the first word by recording a preliminary definition of the word based on context, then checking the answer in a **dictionary**. Invite students to add the remaining words to their vocabulary logs, working with their partners to complete all columns.

- Note that not all students will be able to complete the Translation column. Encourage native English speakers to record translations provided by their peers. ▲

- Direct students to distinguish between academic and domain-specific words by marking academic vocabulary with a star. Circulate to monitor for correct definitions and notations.

- Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning target, using a checking for understanding technique—for example, Thumb-O-Meter. Scan student responses, and make a note of students who might need support. Check in with them moving forward.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- Adapt work with the vocabulary log in Work Time B by adding other elements that may further help students develop their knowledge of a word. Examples may include:

- Pronunciation: How do you say this word?

- Forms of the word: What are the different forms of the word?

- Translation and cognate: What is the translation in your home language? Does the word look like a similar word in your home language?

- Synonyms and antonyms: What words have a similar meaning? What words have the opposite meaning?

- Collocations: What other words are commonly used with the word?

- Showing sentences: Where else have you read or heard this word? What does it mean in the new sentence? Provide students with answers to some of these questions for the new vocabulary words of Lesson 2 (e.g., *gist, empathy*), so that students have an example to work from.

Closing and Assessment

A. Reflect on Academic Mindsets (5 minutes)

- Remind students that they reviewed the words *empathy* and *respect* in this and the previous lesson.

- Incorporate reflection on and awareness of the following academic mindset: “I belong in this community.”

- Ask:

“How do empathy and respect help you feel a sense of belonging in this classroom community?” (Possible response: When my classmates listen to me and show they understand my feelings, I feel like I have a safe place in this classroom.)

“Why is it important that each of us feels we belong in this community?” (Possible response: We can’t learn if we don’t feel safe and comfortable.)

Homework

A. Review Plot

- Students complete **Homework: Plot Review: *The Lightning Thief***, **chapter 1**.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students should preread chapter 2 in *The Lightning Thief* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.
