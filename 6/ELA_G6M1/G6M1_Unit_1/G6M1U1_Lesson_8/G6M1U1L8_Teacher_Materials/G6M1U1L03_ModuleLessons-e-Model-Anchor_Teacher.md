<td><strong>Percy thinks Mr. Brunner is a hypocrite because after telling him all year that he believes in him, he is now saying that he was destined to get kicked out. He is also disappointed with Mr. Brunner for saying he isn’t normal. Percy feels Mr. Brunner has let him down because he was Percy’s favorite teacher; yet now he is treating him badly.</strong></td>

<td>chapter 5, page 66: “Chiron smiled at me sympathetically, the way he used to in Latin class, as if to let me know that no matter what my average was, I was his star student. He expected me to have the right answer.”</td>
<td><strong>Percy once again thinks positively of Mr. Brunner. He is reminded of the Mr. Brunner he used to know and has similar feelings toward him in this excerpt as he did in chapter 1.</strong></td>
<td><strong>In chapter 3 Percy thought Mr. Brunner was a hypocrite and was disappointed with Mr. Brunner for treating him badly; however, in chapter 5 Percy learns more about who Mr. Brunner really is, which changes his point of view toward Mr. Brunner back to how he used to think of him in chapter 1. The author develops Percy’s point of view toward Mr. Brunner in chapter 6 by revealing more about who Mr. Brunner really is to Percy. The specific words and phrases the author uses to let us know that Percy’s point of view has changed are, “smiled at me sympathetically,” “the way he used to.”</strong></td>

<td>chapter 6, pages 82–83: from “I kept walking . . .” to “. . . bowed respectfully.”</td>
<td><strong>Percy has a new respect for Mr. Brunner that he didn’t have before because of who Mr. Brunner is (a famous figure from Greek mythology).</strong></td>

Specifically, he uses words and phrases like, “Are you really . . .,” “smiled down at me,” and “stood and bowed respectfully.”</strong></td>

“. . . Chiron told her.”</td>
<td><strong>Percy’s respect for Chiron deepens as he is grateful to Chiron for saving his life and he is in awe of Chiron’s archery skills.</strong></td>
<td><strong>Percy’s respect for Chiron has deepened since chapter 6. The author develops Percy’s point of view toward Chiron in chapter 7 by having Chiron save his life. Specifically, he uses words and phrases, e.g., “cascade of thwacking sounds, like forty pieces of paper being ripped one after the other,” “by some miracle,” and “delicatessen meat.”</strong></td>

”. . . that’s the hard part, the details.”</td>
<td><strong>Percy thinks Chiron is tired and worried with the responsibility of protecting him.</strong></td>
<td><strong>Rather than seeing Chiron as strong as he did in the last chapter when he killed the hellhound to protect Percy, Percy is beginning to see how the responsibility of caring for and worrying about Percy is taking a toll on Chiron. The author develops Percy’s point of view through Percy’s observations of how Chiron looks. He says, “Chiron smiled at me, but he looked tired and strained,” and, “Chiron grimaced.”</strong></td>
