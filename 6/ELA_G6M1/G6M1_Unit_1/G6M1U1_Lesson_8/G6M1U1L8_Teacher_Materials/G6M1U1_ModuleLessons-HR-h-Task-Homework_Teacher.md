5.  Simile and Point of View

**Part A**

Which of the following best describes Percy’s point of view toward the other campers at Camp Half-Blood in excerpts 3 and 4 above?

6.  Percy feels welcomed by the other campers.

7.  Percy thinks the other campers will become his friends.

8.  <u>Percy thinks negatively about the other campers.</u>

9.  Percy feels threatened by the other campers.

**Part B**

How do the similes in excerpts 3 and 4 support your answer for part A and add to the reader’s understanding of how Percy feels?

The two similes have negative meanings. In one he compares the girls to pieces of garbage and in the other he thinks they are going to rob him. These descriptions make clear that Percy doesn’t seem to like the other campers, and he is very critical of them (“sullen,” “suspicious,” and “stupidly” also convey this). The similes reinforce that idea.

10. Simile and Vocabulary

“I watched the satyr playing his pipe. His music was causing lines of bugs to leave the strawberry patch in every direction, <u>like refugees **fleeing** a fire</u>. I wondered if Grover could work that kind of magic with music. I wondered if he was still inside the farmhouse, getting chewed out by Mr. D” (76).

What word best helps in understanding the meaning of **fleeing** in the simile in this excerpt?

11. causing

12. work

13. <u>leave</u>

14. playing
