(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Answer the following questions, using evidence from the text to support your ideas where appropriate.

1.  “Water shot out of the toilet, making an arc straight over my head, and the next thing I knew, I was **sprawled** on the bathroom tiles with Clarisse screaming behind me” (91).

“Outside, Clarisse and her friends were **sprawled** in the mud, and a bunch of other campers had gathered around to gawk” (92).

Use a print or online dictionary. Below, copy the meaning of the word **sprawled** as it is used in these two sentences from chapter 6. (L.6.4, L.6.5a)

Sample student response: The adjective *sprawled* means to be stretched or spread out in an unnatural or ungraceful manner.

2.  “Clarisse,” Annabeth sighed. “Why don’t you go polish your spear or something?”

“Sure, Miss Princess,” the big girl said. “So I can run you through with it Friday night.”

“Erre es korakas!” Annabeth said, which I somehow understood was Greek for ‘Go to the crows!’ though I had a feeling it was a worse curse than it sounded. “You don’t stand a chance.”

“We’ll **pulverize** you,” Clarisse said, but her eye twitched. Perhaps she wasn’t sure she could follow through on the threat. She turned toward me. “Who’s this little runt?” (89).

Complete the chart below to break up the word **pulverize** into a root and suffix. You may use your affix list and dictionary as resources. (L.6.4, L.6.5b)

|            |                                     |        |
|------------|-------------------------------------|--------|
|            | Word Part and Meaning               | Origin |
| **Root**   | ***pulver:* dust**                  | Latin  |
| **Suffix** | \-*ize*: to make/to cause to become |        |

Use what you know about these word parts to write a definition of **pulverize** in your own words, and explain its meaning as it is used in chapter 6.

Sample student response: *Pulverize* literally means make into dust. In the context of chapter 6, Clarisse is using it figuratively to mean that her team is going to beat Annabeth’s team in Capture the Flag.

3.  “It was a lot bigger than I realized–four stories tall, sky blue with white trim, **like an upscale seaside resort**” (75).

What does the figurative language in bold tell you about how the farmhouse looked to Percy? (RL.6.4, L.6.5a)

Sample student response: The bugs were leaving the strawberries very quickly and there were so many of them, they were moving in a long line.

4.  Underline the part of this sentence that best helps the reader understand what a “**caduceus**” looks like. (L.6.5b)

“Over the doorway was one of those doctor’s symbols, **a winged pole with two snakes wrapped around it.** What did they call it . . .? A **caduceus**.” (83)

10. How and why has Percy’s point of view changed since Mr. Brunner last appeared in the novel (chapter 5)? How has the author developed Percy’s point of view toward Mr. Brunner? Which words does he use? (RL.6.1) QuickWrite your response.

Sample student response: In chapter 5 Percy learns more about Mr. Brunner, but he still has questions; however, in chapter 6 he has those questions answered in a way that builds his respect for Mr. Brunner. The author develops Percy’s point of view toward  
Mr. Brunner in chapter 6 by revealing more about Mr. Brunner to Percy. Percy asks  
Mr. Brunner if he is really <u>the</u> Chiron, and he says the other campers “stood and bowed respectfully” to him.
