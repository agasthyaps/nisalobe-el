**Name:** **Date:**

**Directions:** Answer the following questions, using evidence from the text to support your ideas where appropriate.

1.  “Water shot out of the toilet, making an arc straight over my head, and the next thing I knew, I was **sprawled** on the bathroom tiles with Clarisse screaming behind me” (91).

“Outside, Clarisse and her friends were **sprawled** in the mud, and a bunch of other campers had gathered around to gawk” (92).

Use a print or online dictionary. Below, copy the meaning of the word **sprawled** as it is used in these two sentences from chapter 6. (L.6.4, L.6.5a)

2.  “Clarisse,” Annabeth sighed. “Why don’t you go polish your spear or something?”

“Sure, Miss Princess,” the big girl said. “So I can run you through with it Friday night.”

“Erre es korakas!” Annabeth said, which I somehow understood was Greek for ‘Go to the crows!’ though I had a feeling it was a worse curse than it sounded. “You don’t stand a chance.”

“We’ll **pulverize** you,” Clarisse said, but her eye twitched. Perhaps she wasn’t sure she could follow through on the threat. She turned toward me. “Who’s this little runt?” (89).

Complete the chart below to break up the word **pulverize** into a root and suffix. You may use your affix list and dictionary as resources. (L.6.4, L.6.5b)

|            |                       |        |
|------------|-----------------------|--------|
|            | Word Part and Meaning | Origin |
| **Root**   |                       |        |
| **Suffix** |                       |        |

Use what you know about these word parts to write a definition of **pulverize** in your own words, and explain its meaning as it is used in chapter 6.
