Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RL.6.6 – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they examine the way in which the author of *The Lightning Thief* has developed Percy’s point of view toward Mr. Brunner.

- RL.6.1 – Work Time A: Students read the next chapter of the text and find the gist. Students also unpack unfamiliar vocabulary and answer comprehension questions using inferences and evidence from text.

- RL.6.3 – Work Time A: Students answer questions about how Percy responds to challenges in the text and what this reveals about his character.

- RL.6.4 – Work Time B: Students answer text-dependent questions that require determining the figurative meanings of words as they are used in the text, focusing on the impact of word choice on meaning.

- RL.6.6 – Work Time B: Students answer additional questions about Percy’s changing point of view.

- L.6.4 – Work Time B: Students apply a variety of strategies to determine the meanings of unknown words in *The Lightning Thief*.

- L.6.5a – Work Time B: Students answer text-dependent questions about figurative language in the text.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Given the possible content issues mentioned in Support All Students, one possible idea for extension would be to further examine, unpack, and discuss the ways in which Riordan represents female characters, people of varying physical and cognitive abilities, and social class. Additionally, balance the Western perspective by the inclusion of non-Western influences or by examining similar myths of non-Western cultures—for example, the *Ramayana*.

- Invite students to identify other examples of figurative language in chapter 6 and to interpret the meanings.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In previous lessons, students read through chapter 5 of *The Lightning Thief*, found the gist, determined the meanings of unfamiliar words and phrases, and began work with point of view and figurative language. In this lesson, students continue to read the novel and expand their thinking about point of view as well as figurative language and how Percy has responded to challenges in preparation for the Mid-Unit 1 and End of Unit 1 Assessments.

Support All Students

- Note there are differentiated versions of the entrance ticket used in Opening A and the Text-Dependent Questions: *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 6 in the separate Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Continue to be mindful about issues and characterizations that may be sensitive for students or with which some students may connect personally or deeply. In addition to the text’s focus on and promotion of Western culture and the idea that the gods act in non-benevolent and even malevolent ways, chapter 6 contains discussion of the likely causes of Percy’s ADHD and dyslexia, respectively as “battlefield reflexes” and a brain “hardwired for Greek.” This perspective, of course, goes against the science and research about these real cognitive conditions, and this reasoning may have implications for students who may have either or both of these conditions and who are not children of gods or goddesses; they may wonder what this means about the causes of their ADHD or dyslexia. One line—”Of course your teachers want you medicated. Most of them are monsters” (88)—could be interpreted as a criticism of medication for treatment or as a suggestion that teachers are not advocates of students or of students with special needs. Of additional possible concern are the characterization of body size/image of Clarisse, the reference to “refugees fleeing a fire” (76), and the bullying episode itself. Use point of view as a way to remind students that the perspectives and experiences of characters may be distinct from ours or the author’s.

- Students may need additional support with the reading of the chapter. As during previous lessons in which reading takes place, provide students with a number of options for reading (small group, pairs, individual), sometimes allowing them to decide and sometimes deciding for them, taking into account their strengths, needs, and interests and grouping deliberately as needed. No matter what options are chosen, also be mindful about variety, being sure to change the routine to maintain engagement and to support students effectively. ▲

- Group students into triads strategically to read and answer text-dependent questions.

- Students may need additional support with determining the gist, working through unfamiliar vocabulary, and answering text-dependent questions. Again, use thoughtful pairing, and consider which groups might need more constant support. ▲

- Students who would benefit from fluency practice should be encouraged and supported during Work Time A to read with a partner or small group. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson facilitates opportunities for students to interpret figurative language (e.g., similes) derived from their anchor text, prompts deeper engagement with the text through text-dependent questions, and continues to exercise students’ abilities to describe gist and identify point of view.

- ELLs may find it challenging to differentiate figurative from literal meanings of unfamiliar words. Review any strategies discussed in the previous lesson, and remind students that this process is an ongoing one. Create opportunities to celebrate incremental successes.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1 and 6.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- In Work Time B, as students answer text-dependent questions, review students’ answers to identify common issues. Use these common issues as teaching points in the whole group share-out in Closing and Assessment A.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students engage in a Language Dive focused on word relationships and how those help to convey meaning. Students continue in their anchor text, reading from chapter 7, determining gist and unfamiliar vocabulary and then continuing to analyze how Riordan conveys Percy’s point of view. This work will be assessed during Lesson 11 via the mid-unit assessment.

- For the rest of Unit 1, students continue to read chapters from *The Lightning Thief*, determining gist, recording unfamiliar vocabulary, and examining point of view and use of language. During Unit 2, students finish reading the novel, focusing on Percy’s character and themes in comparison to Greek myths to which they’ve been introduced through the novel.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RL.6.6 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 8** or **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 8** ▲.

- See **Entrance Ticket: Unit 1, Lesson 8 (for teacher reference)**.

- Invite students to share their entrance ticket with an elbow partner. Based on responses, update the **Point of View anchor chart**. Refer to the **Point of View anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**.

- Ensure students recognize that as the story goes on and readers learn more about Mr. Brunner, Percy’s point of view of Mr. Brunner changes. At the beginning of the story, Percy thought Mr. Brunner was a cool, interesting teacher. Then he was disappointed with Mr. Brunner because of the way he interpreted Mr. Brunner’s words. Now he knows Mr. Brunner was actually trying to help him and keep him safe at the school, so he has a positive opinion of him again.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

Work Time

A. Read *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 6 Excerpt – RL.6.3 (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Read aloud the selected excerpt, using **Text Guide: *The Lightning Thief*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Refer to the following resources as appropriate to support this section of the lesson: **Gist Record: *The Lightning Thief*** **anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**, **vocabulary logs**, **chapter synopsis**, and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Excerpt: Starting at page 85 “When we were a few feet away, Annabeth said, ‘Jackson, you have to do better than that . . . ’” and ending at page 92 “‘ . . . I’m thinking,’ she said, ‘that I want you on my team for capture the flag.’”

- Gist: Percy is assigned to Cabin 11, which is for Hermes and the undetermined demigods.

- Ask:

“What challenges does Percy face in chapter 6?” (his identity as half-god; an encounter with Clarisse in the bathroom)

“What is his response to those challenges?” (Percy responds with disbelief when Annabeth explains that he is the son of a god. Percy is attacked by Clarisse yet somehow manages to get the best of her, much to his surprise.)

“What might that reveal about this character?” (Percy is skeptical and curious while also confused by what’s happening at this point in the text.)

“In what ways did the characters demonstrate or not demonstrate a habit of character in this chapter?” (Possible response: Clarisse did not demonstrate respect when she called Percy mean names and tried to beat him up.)

Work Time

B. Complete Text-Dependent Questions: *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 6 – RL.6.6 (15 minutes)

- Distribute and display **Text-Dependent Questions: *The Lightning Thief***, **Chapter 6** or **Text-Dependent Questions: *The Lightning Thief***, **Chapter 6** ▲. Remind students to refer to their **affix lists** as needed.

- Students work with their reading groups to respond to the text-dependent questions. They should be prepared to share their responses during the closing review. As students work, continue to circulate and support students as needed, pushing them back into the text for evidence to support their responses.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- After Work Time B, encourage ELLs to add new words from the text-dependent questions (e.g., *sprawled, pulverize*) to their **vocabulary logs**.

For Heavier Support

- For Work Time B, strategically determine reading groups so that groups include both more and less proficient ELLs. This will help less proficient ELLs maintain a reasonable pace as they complete the text-dependent questions.

Closing and Assessment

A. Review Text-Dependent Questions: *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 6 – RL.6.6 (10 minutes)

- Refocus the whole group.

- Briefly review each text-dependent question, and cold call students to share their responses with the whole group. Focus particularly on questions 3 and 6, as these questions might need further teaching or explanation, depending on student responses. Refer to the **Text-Dependent Questions: *The Lightning Thief***, **Chapter 6 (example for teacher reference)** as necessary, and update the Point of View anchor chart. Refer to the Point of View anchor chart (example for teacher reference).

- Ensure students recognize that as the story goes on and readers learn more about Mr. Brunner, Percy’s point of view of Mr. Brunner changes. At the beginning of the story, Percy thought Mr. Brunner was a cool, interesting teacher. Now he knows Mr. Brunner is actually Chiron, who was a famous figure in Greek mythology.

- If productive, use Goal 1 Conversation Cues encourage students to expand their responses to the text-dependent questions by giving examples.

“Can you say more about that?”

“Can you give an example?”

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- When completing the simile homework, students may be confused by the multiple meanings of the words *like* and *as*, and this may cause them to misidentify similes. If time allows, develop a short mini lesson or handout that reminds students of these multiple meanings and offers additional tips about what to look for when locating similes.

Homework

A. Identify Figurative Language

- Students complete **Homework: Simile: *The Lightning Thief***, **Chapter 6**.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students should preread chapter 7 in *The Lightning Thief* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.
