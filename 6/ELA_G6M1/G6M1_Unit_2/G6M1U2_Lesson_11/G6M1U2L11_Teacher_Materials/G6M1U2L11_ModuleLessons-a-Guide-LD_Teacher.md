Language Dive Guide: Compare and Contrast Model Essay, Conclusion and Reflection

W.6.2f

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

**<u>Perhaps the biggest similarity between the book and the movie is the feeling of strength and power both readers and viewers experience</u> as they make this fantastic journey <u>alongside Percy and his friends.</u>** (from the Unit 2 Compare and Contrast Model Essay, paragraph 4)

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps to address the daily learning target and W.6.2f by facilitating a deep investigation of a concluding statement in a model essay.

- Supporting Standards: SL.6.1.

- Guiding Question: The sentence helps respond to the guiding question (**Why have stories from Greek mythology remained popular?**) by highlighting the relatability of these stories for people who read or watch movies about them.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it playfully addresses the relationship between the reader and the characters in a text by talking about the “journey” they take together. The sentence also demonstrates the versatility of the word as, which here introduces a temporal relationship between events in the sentences. Invite students to discuss each chunk briefly, but encourage extended conversation and practice with the focus structure: **as they make this fantastic journey**.

- Practice and Transfer: After discussing the focus structure, students practice using it to discuss something in their lives. Students transfer their understanding of the meaning and structure of this sentence when reflecting on differences and similarities between the movie and book during in-class activities and during the End of Unit 2 Assessment.
