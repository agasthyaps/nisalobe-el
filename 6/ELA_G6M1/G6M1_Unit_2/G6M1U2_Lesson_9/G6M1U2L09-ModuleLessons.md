Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.6.2a – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they trade their essays’ focus statements with a partner and give and receive kind and helpful feedback.

- RL.6.1 – Work Time A: Students read the next chapter of the text and find the gist. Students also unpack unfamiliar vocabulary and answer comprehension questions using inferences and evidence from text.

- RL.6.1 – Work Time B: Students plan the first Proof Paragraph of their essays, using evidence from *The Lightning Thief* to support their ideas. Students will apply their learning from the Painted Essay® structure to describe the similarities between the novel and the film. Students will practice organizing the facts, concrete details, and examples into a coherent structure.

- RL.6.7 – Work Time B: Students plan the first Proof Paragraph of an essay in which they contrast the experience of reading a scene in a story with the experience of watching the same scene in a film.

- W.6.2b – Work Time B: Students develop the topic of their essays in their first Proof Paragraphs using relevant facts, concrete details, quotations, and examples.

- W.6.4 – Work Time B: Using the Compare and Contrast Model Essay as guidance, students organize a clear and coherent Proof Paragraph with attention to task, purpose, and audience.

- W.6.5 – Work Time B: Students receive some support as they strengthen their writing by thoughtfully planning the first Proof Paragraph of their essays.

- W.6.9a – Work Time B: Students apply Grade 6 Reading standards to literature by comparing and contrasting a video clip and its corresponding scene in the text.

- RL.6.7 – Closing and Assessment A: Students share their plans with a partner and give and receive feedback on the connections drawn across the text and film.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Use “brag tags” to identify students who are particularly good at different aspects of writing a Proof Paragraph, and allow them to conference with their classmates to give advice on their area of expertise.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lessons, students analyzed the structure of the model essay using the Painted Essay® template and planned their introductory paragraph. They build on those foundations in this lesson.

Support All Students

- Students may be confused or upset by the characterization of some characters in the novel as “gangbangers,” “bums,” and “street hawkers.” Time for debriefing and reflection might help get these concerns out into the open so they can be addressed and tracked throughout the text.

- In chapter 17, one line of *The Lightning Thief* (“‘There’s no such thing as a free lunch.’ That’s an ancient Greek saying that translated pretty well into American”) appears to conflate the English language with an American identity. Be aware of ways in which this embedded attitude could feel alienating to ELLs. Welcome any critical questions posed by students. ▲

- Students may need additional support while planning their Proof Paragraphs. Group those students for a guided discussion to find evidence to support their points. ▲

- Provide opportunities for students to interact and discuss what they want to include in their Proof Paragraphs before they begin planning independently.

- To support ELLs, this lesson offers scaffolded guidance as students plan Proof Paragraph 1 of their compare and contrast essays. This helps students organize their ideas through revisiting their Compare and Contrast Film and Text: *The Lightning Thief* note-catcher notes from Lesson 7.

- ELLs may find it challenging to begin developing ideas for these important Proof Paragraphs of their essays. Provide support, and remind them of the resources available to them, including their notes from Lesson 7, the Compare and Contrast Model Essay, the Painted Essay® template, and their peers. Also, reiterate the purpose of a planning stage as an important time to cultivate ideas; at this point, having all the right words to express those ideas is less critical.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.C.10, 6.I.C.11, and 6.II.C.1.

Assessment Guidance

- Use the Informative Writing checklist to assess students’ writing abilities in Work Time B.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will continue planning their compare and contrast essay, focusing on their second Proof Paragraph. They will also read from chapter 18 of *The Lightning Thief*.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Strategically decide how students will accomplish the reading for today’s class. Be mindful of and balance variety with students’ needs and their desire for choice while planning for the reading time during the lessons.

- Review the student tasks and example answers to get familiar with what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Preread chapter 17 in *The Lightning Thief* to identify words or plot points that may challenge students.

- Prepare copies of handouts for students, including entrance ticket (see Materials list).

- Cut up the Proof Paragraph 1 Strips in preparation for the activity in Work Time B.

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.6.2a (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 9**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

- Underline the phrase *Proof Paragraph*. Using a total participation technique, invite responses from the group:

“What is the purpose of Proof Paragraph 1?” (It explains Point 1 by giving evidence and examples.)

- Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**, and invite them to read the habits of character on the chart to themselves. Tell students to choose a habit to focus on as they work today.

Work Time

A. Read *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 17 Excerpt – RL.6.1 (20 minutes)

- Repeated Routine: Read aloud the selected excerpt, using **Text Guide: *The Lightning Thief*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Refer to the following resources as appropriate to support this section of the lesson: **Gist Record: *The Lightning Thief*** **anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**, **vocabulary logs**, **chapter synopsis**, and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Excerpt: starting at the beginning of the chapter on page 266 “It was Annabeth’s idea . . . ” and ending on page 274 “ . . . we turned our backs on the sea.”

- Gist: A Nereid, or “a spirit of the sea,” gives Percy three pearls to help him escape danger. Hiding in a waterbed store, the trio are trapped by Procrustes, aka “Crusty” the Stretcher, and manage to escape after cutting off his head.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- If any extra time remains in Work Time A, encourage students to scan their vocabulary logs and highlight any vocabulary words that they might want to include in their compare and contrast essays.

For Heavier Support

Work Time

B. Plan Proof Paragraph 1 – W.6.2b (15 minutes)

- Review the learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can compare and contrast what I see and hear when I read the text to what I perceive when I watch the same scene of the movie.”

“I can plan the first Proof Paragraph of a compare and contrast essay.”

- Move students into predetermined pairs.

- Distribute **yellow construction paper** and **Organize the Model: Proof Paragraph 1 strips**.

- Invite students to refer to their **Painted Essay® template** to remember where Proof Paragraph 1 fits in the structure of an informational piece.

- Remind students that the yellow paragraph is about similarities and the blue paragraph is about differences.

- Read aloud the introduction of the **Compare and Contrast Model Essay** again to remind students where the writer left off, before transitioning into the first Proof Paragraph.

- Post and review the following directions:

- Read and lay out the sentence strips on the yellow construction paper.

- Organize each set of strips logically as they would appear in Proof Paragraph 1. (Remind students that the paragraph should begin with a topic sentence, end with a concluding sentence, and include relevant evidence from the text.)

- Check your work against the Compare and Contrast Model Essay.

- Answer clarifying questions about what students will be doing in this activity. Model sorting displayed strips, if necessary.

- Invite students to begin working, and circulate to support them in reading and sorting the strips.

- Refocus whole group.

- Have students choral read Proof Paragraph 1. ▲

- For each sentence strip, ask:

“What is the purpose of this sentence or group of sentences?”

- Listen for students to notice that the topic sentence tells the readers that Proof Paragraph 1 is about the similarities, related evidence is grouped together and all relates back to the topic sentence, and the concluding sentence explains the significance of the points made in the paragraph.

- Invite students to help record the criteria for Proof Paragraph 1 on the **Criteria for an Effective Informative Essay anchor chart**. Refer to **Criteria for an Effective Informative Essay anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** as necessary. Point out that in a Proof Paragraph, the author provides evidence from the text and elaborates by explaining how the evidence he or she has chosen supports the focus statement.

- Invite students to retrieve and read their **Informative/Explanatory Writing Plan graphic organizer** started in the previous lesson to remind them of their focus statement and their ideas before planning their own Proof Paragraph 1.

- Invite students to refer to their **Compare and Contrast Film and Text: *The Lightning Thief*** **note-catcher**, Compare and Contrast Model Essay, the criteria on the Criteria for an Effective Informative Essay anchor chart, the **Informative Writing checklist**, and the **domain-specific word wall** to plan Proof Paragraph 1. Remind students that, at this time, they are only planning, not drafting, Proof Paragraph 1. If needed, model filling out this part of the Informative/Explanatory Writing Plan graphic organizer using the information in the **Annotated Compare and Contrast Model Essay (for teacher reference)**.

- Circulate to support students as they work and to identify common issues to use as whole group teaching points.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Heavier Support

- For ELLs and students who may need support planning their writing during Work Time B, model doing quick sketches within the graphic organizer as placeholders for information. Say:

“You can sketch first so that you don’t forget the information you want to add. Then you may go back later and write.”

- During Work Time B, think about ways to strategically group students to plan their Proof Paragraphs. Grouping ELLs by proficiency level and joining the low-proficiency students to support their progress and answer questions.

- Also, for students with little experience writing essays in English, allow them to draft their Proof Paragraph in their home language first before translating it into English. In the following lesson, release this scaffold by encouraging these students to produce a first draft of Proof Paragraph 2 in English.

Closing and Assessment

A. Pair Share – RL.6.7 (5 minutes)

- Invite students to join a partner sitting next to them to form a pair and share their organizers. Encourage them to press each other for evidence from the text and connections to their focus statement.

For Lighter Support

- If it seems productive to do so, use the Pair Share time as an opportunity for students to ask lingering questions.

For Heavier Support

N/A

Homework

A. Plan Proof Paragraph 1

- Students review and revise their plan for their second Proof Paragraph to make sure they are accurately contrasting the experiences of seeing the film and reading the novel. Remind students that, at this time, they are only planning, not drafting, their first Proof Paragraph.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students should preread chapter 18 in ***The Lightning Thief*** in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.
