Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Work Time B: Students complete the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment. The assessment invites students to read a new myth, “Prometheus,” and use evidence from the text to support their analysis of the text and its themes. Students also produce a summary of “Prometheus” that highlights its theme and most important details, and they compare its themes to those in a selection from *The Lightning Thief*. (RL.6.1, RL.6.2, RL.6.4, RL.6.9, RL.6.10, L.6.4)

- RL.6.1 – Closing and Assessment A: Students reflect on their learning using the Track Progress: Read, Understand, and Explain New Text recording form, which tracks their developing ability to read new texts and extract textual evidence to support their analysis of the text. This exercise is meant to provide them with time to formally keep track of and reflect on their own learning. This self-reflection supports metacognition and pride in work and learning.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- The Mid-Unit 2 Assessment naturally accommodates exceptional students by allowing more proficient writers to display their writing prowess.

- The story of Prometheus, featured in the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment, is similar to myths from other cultures, like the Native American story of Raven bringing fire to humans. Provide access to versions of similar myths and invite students to draw connections to these additional texts. ▲

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the first half of this unit, students read Greek myths referenced in *The Lightning Thief*, determining themes and key details from the texts, summarizing what they read, and comparing and contrasting the myths with the novel. This lesson continues those routines in an assessment.

Support All Students

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment.

- Some students may need the text read aloud before they work on the questions. Invite students who require this to sit in a group away from the rest of the students, so as not to be distracting.

- For some students, this assessment may require more than the 25 minutes allotted. Provide time over multiple days if necessary.

- Some students may require support with limiting distractions during the assessment (e.g., using sound-canceling headphones or dividers between workspaces). Similarly, some students may require variations in time for the assessment. Break the assessment into more manageable parts, and offer breaks at certain times. During the assessment, provide scaffolds that support executive function skills, self-regulation, and students’ abilities to monitor progress before and after the assessment (e.g., visual prompts, reminders, checklists, rubrics). ▲

- After the assessment, ask students to discuss which assessment task was easiest and which was most difficult, and why. In future lessons and for homework, focus on the language skills that will help students address these assessment challenges. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson invites students to complete assessment tasks similar to the classroom tasks practiced in Lessons 1–4. Note that the agenda calls for returning End of Unit 1 Assessments to students with feedback at the beginning of class. Depending on students’ assessment performance and general attitude, consider waiting until the end of class to distribute graded assessments so students are not overly anxious as they begin their mid-unit assessments.

- ELLs may find the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment challenging, as it is a big leap from heavily scaffolded classroom tasks. ELLs will be asked to independently apply cognitive and linguistic skills developed in Lessons 1–4. The assessment also requires that students read and summarize a page-long Greek myth that is new to them. Validate students’ concerns, but remind them of their hard work tackling similar tasks in previous lessons. Encourage students to do their best, and assure them that they will continue learning together after the assessment.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.B.6, 6.I.C.9, and 6.I.C.12.

Assessment Guidance

- Mid-Unit 2 Assessment: Compare and Contrast Themes in Literature (student and teacher versions) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback on this assessment, use the answer key and sample student responses (see Assessment Overview and Resources) to help complete students’ Track Progress recording form.

- In this assessment, students are tracking progress toward the following anchor standards:

- R.1: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.

- R.4: Interpret words and phrases as they are used in a text, including determining technical, connotative, and figurative meanings, and analyze how specific word choices shape meaning or tone.

- R.10: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Read and comprehend complex literary and informational texts independently and proficiently.

- L.4: Determine or clarify the meaning of unknown and multiple-meaning words and phrases by using context clues, analyzing meaningful word parts, and consulting general and specialized reference materials, as appropriate.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will begin preparing for the End of Unit 2 Assessment, in which they write an essay comparing and contrasting how a scene from the novel version of *The Lightning Thief* is depicted in the film version. They will study a model essay and be introduced to the Painted Essay® structure.

- Students’ Mid-Unit 2 Assessments will be returned in Lesson 12 with feedback.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Return End of Unit 1 Assessments (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 5**. Students will also need their **End of Unit 1 Assessment with feedback**.

Opening

B. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

- Remind students that they saw a version of the first learning target in the previous lesson, and review vocabulary: *compare* (similarities between two sources), *contrast* (differences between two sources), and *approach* (the choices an author or film director makes about conveying a story), as needed. ▲

Work Time

A. Mid-Unit 2 Assessment: Compare and Contrast Themes in Literature – RL.6.9 (25 minutes)

- Distribute **Mid-Unit 2 Assessment: Compare and Contrast Themes in Literature**, and invite students to take out their copies of ***The Lightning Thief***.

- Tell students that for this assessment, they will read a new Greek myth, “Prometheus.” They will then identify the main ideas and key details of the myth, summarize it, and finally, compare and contrast the themes in the myth with those in an excerpt from *The Lightning Thief*.

- Read aloud the directions for each part of the assessment as students follow along, reading silently. Make sure students understand the assessment directions; paraphrase some instructions, if needed. ▲ Answer students’ questions, but refrain from supplying answers to the assessment questions themselves.

- Direct students’ attention to the following anchor charts:

- **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart**

- **Strategies to Answer Selected Response Questions anchor chart**

- Remind students to refer to these anchor charts as they read the assessment text and answer the assessment questions.

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence. Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**, and review what perseverance looks and sounds like. Remind students that because they will be reading and answering questions independently for the assessment, they may need to practice perseverance.

- Invite students to begin the assessment.

- While they are taking the assessment, circulate to monitor and document their test-taking skills.

- Give students specific, positive feedback on their completion of the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment.

For Lighter Support

- After the assessment, ask students to discuss which assessment task was easiest and which was most difficult, and why. In future lessons and for homework, focus on the language skills that will help students address these assessment challenges.

For Heavier Support

- Display a “map” of the assessment to reference while explaining directions to the mid-unit assessment. This will reduce ambiguity and give students a clearer picture of what they can expect so that they can better allocate their time and attentional resources. Provide students with colored pencils or highlighters so that they can mark up the map as needed. Example:

Part I: Read a new myth.

- Guess a word’s meaning using context.

- Guess a word’s meaning using roots and affixes.

- Identify a theme.

- Identify what happens to show the theme.

- Write a summary.

Part II: Reread pages from *The Lightning Thief*.

- Identify a theme.

- Identify what happens to show the theme.

- Compare and contrast the myth and *The Lightning Thief*.

- When giving feedback on the summaries written during the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment, ELLs’ writing might contain a multitude of language errors. Focus only on one or two pervasive errors to avoid overwhelming the student. Prioritize attention to content-related and organizational/structural errors over sentence-level errors, unless these errors disrupt comprehension of the summary overall.

Closing and Assessment

A. Track Progress (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work in this section.

“I can independently read, understand, and explain the meaning of a new text.”

- Distribute **Track Progress folders**, **Track Progress: Read, Understand, and Explain New Text**, and **sticky notes**.

- Guide students through completing the recording form.

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their independent reading journal.
