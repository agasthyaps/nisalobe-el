(Answers for Teacher Reference)

**Part I**

**Directions:** Read the text, and answer the questions that follow.

**Prometheus**

Prometheus and his brother Epimethus were Titans trusted by Eros, God of Love, to give special gifts and abilities to the beasts, birds, and fishes of the world. They were also given the task of making a creature less great than the gods and the Titans, but higher in knowledge and understanding than the beasts, birds and fishes. Prometheus and Epimethus were so generous with their gifts for the beasts, birds, and fishes that nothing was left for the creature that was to be called Man.

Prometheus took some clay from the ground at his feet, moistened it with water, and formed it to look like the gods. Into its nostrils was breathed the spirit of life, and it was given a soul. And so the first Man looked wonderingly round on the earth. He was naked, unprotected, and more helpless than any of the beasts. Prometheus pitied him more than the animals, since Man had a soul to suffer. He looked to Zeus, ruler of Olympus, to have compassion for Man and to help him, but Zeus refused.

Prometheus thought of a power belonging only to the gods. He said to Epimethus, “We shall give fire to the Man we have made.” He waited patiently and, unseen by the gods, made his way into Olympus, lighted a torch with a spark from the chariot of the Sun, and brought this royal gift to Man. With fire, Man no longer trembled in the darkness of caves when Zeus hurled his lightning across the sky. He was no longer scared of the animals that hunted him. With fire, Man made weapons, defied the frost and cold, made tools and money, introduced the arts, and was able to destroy as well as to create.

From his throne on Olympus, Zeus looked down on the earth and saw blue-gray smoke that curled upward to the sky. He watched more closely and realized with terrible wrath that what he saw came from fire. Fire had been the gods’ own sacred power. He was apathetic to Man and gathered a council of the gods to decide how to punish Prometheus for deceiving him. Zeus chained Prometheus to the top of a mountain, and every day an eagle came and ate Prometheus’ liver. Every night, his liver grew back.

This council also decided to punish Man. They decided to create something that should forever charm the souls and hearts of men and forever be Man’s downfall. They created Pandora, the first woman. She carried with her a jar filled with sickness, death, and evil.

5.  Write a summary of “Prometheus.” Remember, a summary should include: an introduction stating the title, a brief outline of what the text is about, a possible theme, details from the text to support your theme, and no opinions or judgments. (RL.6.1, RL.6.2)

Sample student response: “The Story of Prometheus” tells of how Prometheus brought fire to humankind. Prometheus had the task of creating human beings. Prometheus felt sorry for these creatures because they had no gifts and their souls made them higher than animals, so they could suffer. He hoped the god Zeus would help humans, but Zeus refused. So, Prometheus gave humans the gift of fire. Fire gave humans great power, to cook and make weapons and to not be afraid. Zeus thought this power was too great for humans. He punished Prometheus forever, and he and his council brought Pandora and her jar of evil to torment Man. This conveys the theme that human beings have great powers, but should never have as much power as the gods.

**Theme: The Greek gods were very powerful and used their power to control their human subjects.**

**Part A**

Evidence from “Prometheus” (myth): How does this evidence convey the theme?

Sample student responses: “They were also given the task of making a creature less great than the gods and the Titans, but higher in knowledge and understanding than the beasts, birds and fishes.” This shows that when tasked with creating a being for the earth, the Greek gods wanted the being to be less than them because they didn’t want anyone to have more power than them.

OR

“Fire had been the gods’ own sacred power and was too powerful for Man.” This describes that a power meant only for the Greek gods was too powerful for humans, suggesting humans are inferior to and less powerful than the gods.

OR

“This council also decided to punish Man. They decided to create a thing that should forever charm the souls and hearts of men and forever be Man’s downfall. This thing was Pandora, the first woman. She carried with her a jar filled with sickness, death, and evil.” The gods do not let human beings get away with being so capable and powerful. They punish them by creating Pandora and her jar. The gods have the power over people to do this, and they use it.

**Part B**

Evidence from pages 142–145 of *The Lightning Thief*: How does this evidence convey the theme?

Sample student responses: “A strange fire burned in my stomach. The weirdest thing was: it wasn’t fear. It was anticipation . . . Hades had tried to kill me three times so far . . . Now he was trying to frame me and my dad for a theft we hadn’t committed. I was ready to take him on.” This shows the power struggle between Percy and a Greek god, Hades. It shows how confident Percy is. He is not afraid of Hades and is ready to challenge him.

OR

“Heroes . . . have certain privileges. They can go anywhere, challenge anyone, as long as they’re bold enough and strong enough to do it.” This shows how certain courageous humans can challenge the power of the Greek gods.

**Part C**

What is similar about how the theme is conveyed in the two stories?  
What is different? Provide one similarity and one difference.

Sample student response: One similarity is that both texts show the different power levels of the gods compared to the humans.

One difference is that in “Prometheus,” Zeus is more powerful than Man. He and his council punish Man for the gift of fire by bringing Pandora, who would unleash misery on the human world. Whereas in *The Lightning Thief*, Percy decides to challenge the gods. He is not willing to be a pawn to their power.
