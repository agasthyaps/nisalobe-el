Language Dive Guide: Compare and Contrast Model Essay, Appropriate Transitions

W.6.2c

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

The settings of the novel and the movie, **while not exactly the same,** are quite similar. (from paragraph 2 of Unit 2 Compare and Contrast Model Essay)

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps to address the daily learning target and W.6.2c because it features appropriate transitions to organize ideas and include additional information.

- Supporting Standards: SL.6.1.

- Guiding Question: By pointing out that mythological stories have been refashioned in contemporary novels and movies, this sentence relates to the big idea that **stories from Greek mythology remain relatable because they can be reimagined to fit different environments and time periods.**

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses an adverbial phrase to insert additional information into a sentence. Invite students to discuss each chunk briefly, but encourage extended conversation and practice with the focus structure: **while not exactly the same.**

- Practice and Transfer: After discussing the focus structure, students practice using it to discuss something in their lives. Students transfer their understanding of the meaning and structure of this sentence when revising their compare and contrast essays to include more effective transitions.

- Delivery: The chunks are presented out of order to provide context for the reason presented in the final chunk, allowing for better understanding and discussion.

Deconstruct

- Invite students to put their finger by this sentence from paragraph 2 of the Compare and Contrast Model Essay on their note-catchers: **The settings of the novel and the movie, <u>while not exactly the same,</u> are quite similar.**

- Read aloud the sentence twice, and then ask students to take turns reading the sentence aloud with their partners.

- Say:

“What does this sentence mean to you?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“How does this sentence add to your understanding of the big idea that stories from Greek mythology remain relatable because they can be reimagined to fit different environments and time periods?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

The setting of the novel and the movie,

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following sentence chunk strip: **The setting of the novel and the movie,**

- Say:

“Where in the sentence is this chunk located? How do you know?” (At the beginning, because it begins with a capital letter.)

“What is the meaning of this chunk?” (This chunk is talking about the place and time of the novel and movie.)

“What do you think the next chunk will say?” (Responses will vary.)

are quite similar.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **are quite similar.**

- Say:

“Where in the sentence is this chunk located? How do you know?” (At the end, because it ends with a period.)

“What is the meaning of this chunk?” (This chunk is talking about how the novel and the movie have almost the same setting.)

“Do you agree that the setting of the book and the movie are quite similar? Why or why not?” (Responses will vary.)

- Say:

“With these two chunks alone, we have a complete sentence: The settings of the novel and the movie are quite similar. What if we wanted to make this sentence longer by adding more information? Where could we add it?” (Responses will vary, but students will likely point out that information could be added to the beginning or the end of the sentence.)

while not exactly the same,

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **while not exactly the same,**

- Say:

“Where in the sentence is this chunk located? How do you know?” (in the middle, because it begins with a lowercase letter and has a comma after it)

“What is the meaning of this chunk?” (This chunk is pointing out that the setting of the book and the movie are not totally alike, even though they are similar.)

- Remind students that the sentence makes sense without this chunk: **The settings of the novel and movie are quite similar.**

“Why do you think the writer of this sentence includes this chunk, while not exactly the same?” (Responses will vary. Help students understand that this phrase uses the transition word while to add more information about the settings of the novel and the movie. This chunk reminds us that the settings of the novel and the movie are not identical, though they are close. This language could help students be more precise in their own writing.)

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Display the sentence frame: **\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_, while not exactly the same, are similar because they both \_\_\_\_\_.**

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use these frames to talk with your triad about two things that are very similar, but not exactly the same. You can talk about whatever you’d like: movies, books, animals, food, etc. You can also take notes on your note-catcher, if you wish.” 🖉

- Invite responses, and display students’ ideas.

The settings of the novel and the movie, while not exactly the same, are quite similar.

Reconstruct

- Point to and read the entire sentence on display: **The settings of the novel and the movie, <u>while not exactly the same,</u> are quite similar.**

- Underline the phrase **<u>while not exactly the same,</u>** and invite students to do the same on their note-catchers. 🖉

- Say:

“We saw that the chunk while not exactly the same could be added into a complete sentence as a transition or to introduce a new idea. Is there anywhere else in the sentence where this phrase could go? On your note-catchers, try moving the phrase while not exactly the same to the beginning or end of the sentence. Make sure to think about capital letters and punctuation. You can work with a partner, and you have 1 minute.” 🖉

- After 1 minute, invite students’ responses, and write and display ideas.

- Say:

“What other questions can we ask that will help us understand this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the big idea that stories from Greek mythology remain relatable because they can be reimagined to fit different environments and time periods?” (Responses will vary.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

Practice

- Display the sentence frame: **The \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of the novel and the movie, while \_\_\_\_\_\_\_, are \_\_\_\_\_\_\_.**

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use this frame to talk about some major narrative element of the novel and the movie in your own words with your triad. You can choose to talk about the characters, the plot, the point of view, etc. You can also take notes on your note-catcher, if you wish.” 🖉

- After 1 minute, have pairs compare their answers with other pairs.
