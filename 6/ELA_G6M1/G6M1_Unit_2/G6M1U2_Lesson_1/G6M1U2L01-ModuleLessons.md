Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- L.6.4 – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they apply strategies to determine the meanings of unknown words.

- RL.6.1 – Work Time A: Students read the next chapter of the text and find the gist. Students also unpack unfamiliar vocabulary and answer comprehension questions using inferences and evidence from text.

- RL.6.2 – Work Time B: Students complete text-dependent questions to demonstrate their understanding of the main idea and theme(s) conveyed through the events of chapter 13.

- RL.6.4 – Work Time B: Students also answer text-dependent questions that ask them to interpret words as they are used in the text.

- RL.6.2 – Work Time C: Students collaborate with their peers to analyze a model summary and generate the criteria of an effective summary. By analyzing a model, students better understand the standard to which they should hold their own writing. By determining the characteristics of a summary through their own personal examination, students experience greater ownership over their learning than they would if simply given the criteria.

- Directions for routines that are repeated from previous lessons have been pared down and noted with “Repeated routine.” For the detailed outline of how to facilitate this part of the lesson, please refer back to previous lessons.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- At this point in the novel, students have gathered a number of new vocabulary words. Challenge some students to deliberately use the words as they are discussing the novel or in their reading responses to internalize their meanings.

- For additional vocabulary practice, invite students to categorize by parts of speech the vocabulary they have pulled from the text so far. Check for understanding, then encourage students to create new categories and rearrange the vocabulary by the new classification.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In this unit, students continue reading *The Lightning Thief* while also reading the original Greek stories referenced in the novel. Students practice writing summaries and continue exploring themes as they build toward writing a compare and contrast essay.

Support All Students

- Note there are differentiated versions of the Text-Dependent Questions: *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 13 used in Work Time B and the Analyze a Model Summary note-catcher used in Work Time C in the Lesson Plan section of this lesson. ▲

- Starting in this lesson, there is again another shift in how students are supported to determine gist. In the earlier lessons, students were guided through the process. Use knowledge of students to determine which students still need the support of the gist handout or more direct support.

- Students may be surprised, offended, confused, or upset by the sensitive content of this chapter (e.g., Annabeth’s difficult relationship with her father and stepmother; the Chimera is described as having a “blood-caked mane”). Additionally, Echidna is described in terms that are critical of her body size. Time for debriefing and reflection might help get these concerns out into the open so they can be addressed and tracked throughout the text.

- Students may struggle to read independently in the allotted time. Think about strategic grouping students of varying proficiency levels. ▲

- Students may struggle to differentiate gist writing from summary writing. Think about modeling, examples, clear definitions, and paraphrases of definitions into more comprehensible languages. ▲

- As students continue to move through a long text, it is important that poor reading habits don’t crystallize. Think about facilitating opportunities to gauge students’ performance/progress/goals. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson teaches ELLs to analyze theme using text-dependent questions similar to those students will encounter on the mid-unit assessment and provides students with a model summary to analyze for its effectiveness. Differentiated versions of the Text-Dependent Questions: *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 13 and Analyze a Model Summary note-catchers ▲ provide additional supports for ELLs (e.g., through glossed words or partially completed answers).

- ELLs may find it challenging to differentiate between summary and gist. Point out that these concepts are similar and that students’ experiences identifying the gist of chapters in *The Lightning Thief* has been useful practice for summary writing. Make it clear that the gist represents the core idea or essential part of a text and may use informal language, while a summary is generally more organized, formal, and comprehensive.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.B.6, 6.I.B.8, and 6.II.A.1.

Assessment Guidance

- Monitor what students are recording on their Text-Dependent Questions note-catchers to ensure that they understand the key points. Look for common errors to use as teaching points and also strong models to share whole group.

- Monitor what students are recording on their Analyze a Model Summary note-catchers to ensure that they understand the key points. See the Criteria for an Effective Summary anchor chart (example for teacher reference). If a lot of students are a long way from being able to write a summary similar to the sample response, add a lesson of additional instruction before the assessment.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will expand their understanding of Greek mythology and theme by engaging in a close read of “Theseus and the Minotaur.” After studying a model summary in this lesson, students will practice writing their own summary of “Theseus and the Minotaur” in the next lesson. They will also read from chapter 14 in *The Lightning Thief*.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.6.4b (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 1**. Students will also need their **affix lists** and a **dictionary**.

- Ask students to hold up the number of fingers on one hand to match the word they think doesn’t fit. Call on a few students to share their reasoning for their choice.

- Direct students to add the prefix *in-* to their **vocabulary logs** as well as the four words from the warm-up question containing the prefix.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

- With students, use the vocabulary strategies on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart** to deconstruct the word *summary* (a short statement of main points). Record on the **academic word wall** with translations in home languages, where appropriate, ▲ and invite students to record words in their vocabulary logs. If needed, post definitions, synonyms, examples, and/or visual representations of the word *summary*. ▲

- Turn and Talk:

“What do you think you will be doing in this lesson based on these learning targets?” (Reading from the next chapter in *The Lightning Thief* and determining what messages or lessons are conveyed through the text. We will also begin looking at the characteristics of summary writing.)

“Why are we doing this? How is it meaningful to you? How will it help you to be successful?” (Discussing theme offers the reader life lessons that he or she may find meaningful. Also, models provide guidance for students to create their best work.)

Work Time

A. Read *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 13 Excerpt – RL.6.1 (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Read aloud the selected excerpt, using **Text Guide: *The Lightning Thief*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Refer to the following resources as appropriate to support this section of the lesson: **Gist Record: *The Lightning Thief*** **anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**, vocabulary logs, **chapter synopsis**, and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Excerpt: Starting at page 203 “The Arch was about a mile . . . ” and ending at page 211 “ . . . I plummeted toward the river.”

- Gist: The trio ends up on the top of the St. Louis Gateway Arch being attacked by Echidna, the Mother of Monsters, and her son, Chimera. Percy jumps off the Arch into the Mississippi River to escape.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time A, provide an opportunity for students to review the strategies they used in Unit 1 to identify the gist of a chapter of *The Lightning Thief* and to develop working definitions of unknown vocabulary words. Remind them to use these strategies when completing the text-dependent questions in Work Time B.

Work Time

B. Analyze Theme: *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 13 – RL.6.2 (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can determine a theme and how it is conveyed through details in chapter 13 of *The Lightning Thief*.”

- Distribute and display **Text-Dependent Questions: *The Lightning Thief***, **Chapter 13** or **Text-Dependent Questions: *The Lightning Thief***, **Chapter 13** ▲.

- Students work with their reading groups to complete the text-dependent questions. Let them know they should be prepared to share their responses. As students work, continue to circulate and support them as needed, pushing them back into the text for evidence to support their responses.

- Refocus the whole group.

- Briefly go through each text-dependent question, and cold call students to share their responses with the whole group. Refer to the **Text-Dependent Questions: *The Lightning Thief***, **Chapter 13 (answers for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- If productive, use a Goal 1 Conversation Cue to encourage students to expand their responses to the text-dependent questions by giving examples:

“Can you say more about that?”

“Can you give an example?”

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- Some of the text-dependent questions in Work Time B, especially question 5, require a considerable amount of reading. Since the goal of this question is to identify an effective summary and not to demonstrate reading ability, provide additional support as needed (e.g., *by reading each option aloud to students*).

Work Time

C. Analyze a Model Summary – RL.6.2 (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze a model to identify characteristics of an effective summary.”

- Distribute and display the **Analyze a Model Summary note-catcher** or **Analyze a Model Summary note-catcher** ▲.

- Read aloud the model as students follow along, reading silently. Remind students they have just seen this paragraph as part of the text-dependent questions.

- Focus students on the first sentence of the summary.

“What is this sentence saying?” (This sentence says that this paragraph will be about chapter 13 of *The Lightning Thief*. Chapter 13 is when the trio arrive in St. Louis as part of their train trip to Denver.)

“What is this sentence doing? What is its function in the paragraph?” (This sentence introduces the text and the central idea of the chapter.)

- Record student answers in the first row of the table on the displayed Analyze a Model Summary note-catcher. Refer to the **Analyze a Model Summary note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** for guidance.

- Invite students to work in pairs to do this for each of the remaining sentences.

- After 3 minutes, refocus whole group and use total participation techniques to select students to share the function of each sentence with the whole group.

- Point students to the second question on the Analyze a Model Summary note-catcher.

- Think-Pair-Share:

“Given your analysis above, generate a list of characteristics for an effective summary.”

- As students share out, record their responses on the **Criteria for an Effective Summary anchor chart**. Refer to the **Criteria for an Effective Summary anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** for guidance.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time C, as students complete the Analyze a Model Summary note-catcher, challenge ELLs who need lighter support to iterate aloud the distinction they see between the questions “What is this sentence saying?” and “What is this sentence doing?” Expressing their understanding of this small difference (i.e., *literal meaning of the sentence vs. function of the sentence in the structure of the paragraph)* will solidify their own understanding of the questions on the note-catcher. These students should also be invited to share their comments with ELLs who need heavier support.

For Heavier Support

Closing and Assessment

A. Reflect on Academic Mindsets (5 minutes)

- Incorporate reflection on and awareness of the following academic mindset: “My ability and competence grow with my effort.”

- Turn and Talk:

“How does our work with the model summary relate to this academic mindset?” (Analyzing a model is the first step in understanding a new skill. Putting in the effort now to analyze a model will help strengthen our ability to write a summary later.)

“Which of the habits of character most closely match the idea stated in this academic mindset? Explain your reasoning.” (Possible response: This academic mindset matches “I show perseverance.” Both statements recognize that learning a skill is a challenge that takes time and effort.)

Homework

A. Analyze Summaries

- Students complete **Homework: Analyze Sample Summaries: *The Lightning Thief***, **Chapter 13**.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students should preread chapter 14 of *The Lightning Thief* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.
