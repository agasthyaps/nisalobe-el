Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 1

RL.6.4, L.6.4b

(For Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, read the learning targets. Then, work with a partner to decide which one of the following words is different from the others, and explain what makes it different.

1.  indignantly: “Pan!” he cried **indignantly**. “P-A-N. The great god Pan!” (189).

2.  invisible: “An **invisible** force pulled me forward” (194).

3.  inconvenient: “But he always talked about my arrival as if it were the most **inconvenient** thing that had ever happened to him” (200).

4.  intense: “And he can radiate fear so **intense** it can drive you insane or stop your heart” (204).

5.  insane: “And he can radiate fear so intense it can drive you **insane** or stop your heart” (204).

You may use your affix list and a dictionary as needed to help you make your decision.

Answer: All but *intense* use one version of the prefix *in-*, the version that means not or without: feeling something is unworthy, an unseen force, something that is not convenient, and not sane. *Intense* uses the prefix *in*- that means in, meaning more  
literally *in*.
