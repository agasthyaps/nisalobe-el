(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Using the Criteria for an Effective Summary anchor chart, assess each of the sample summaries from the excerpt from chapter 13 read in class, and indicate what is missing or what the writer could do to improve.

1.  This chapter excerpt sets up a dramatic cliffhanger after Percy’s encounter with Echidna and Chimera at the top of the St. Louis Arch. Though the chapter ends just as an injured Percy leaps off the Arch, the text seems to convey the theme that sometimes we have to take a risk and go off into the unknown in order to save ourselves or for the possibility of something better than our current situation.

This summary is missing an introductory statement.

2.  Chapter 13 of *The Lightning Thief* details Percy’s, Annabeth’s, and Grover’s stop in St. Louis on train ride to Denver. After an uncomfortable elevator ride to the top of the St. Louis Arch, Percy ends up having to fight Echidna and Chimera. His leg gets hurt by the Chimera, and there is another family at the top with them. There is an explosion, and part of the arch is destroyed. The chapter ends just as an injured Percy leaps off the Arch, which seems to convey the theme that sometimes we have to take a risk and go off into the unknown in order to save ourselves or for the possibility of something better than our current situation.

This summary includes some minor details that are not necessary.

3.  Chapter 13 of *The Lightning Thief* details Percy’s, Annabeth’s, and Grover’s stop in St. Louis on train ride to Denver. The excerpt sets up a dramatic cliffhanger after Percy’s encounter with Echidna and Chimera at the top of the St. Louis Arch. The chapter ends just as an injured Percy leaps off the Arch, and the reader doesn’t discover what happens to him until chapter 14.

This summary is missing a concluding statement and discussion of a possible theme of the chapter.
