English Language Learners: Grade 6: Module 1: Unit 2: Teaching Notes

Write to Inform: Compare and Contrast Text and Film of *The Lightning Thief*

Teaching Notes for Unit 2

Prioritize Lessons for Classrooms with Many ELLs

To prepare for the Unit 2 assessments, prioritize and expand instruction in Lessons 2 and 3, which simulate the process of reading and extracting themes from new texts, and Lesson 4, which requires that students compare and contrast text themes in a way that is similar to the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment. The Language Dives of Lessons 8, 11, and 14 support reading abilities for students at all proficiency levels though are particularly critical for ELLs, as these exercises accelerate language development. Due to the density of the unit, there are few opportunities to condense lessons and still ensure that students are adequately prepared for Unit 2 assessments. To ease pressure on class time, assigned chapters of *The Lightning Thief* have again been excerpted, as they were in Unit 1. Additionally, to lighten students’ in-class reading load, students are asked to preread chapters of *The Lightning Thief* independently as homework. Prereading also helps students familiarize themselves with the content and improve fluency.

Language Dives

Unit 2 features three Language Dives. In Lesson 8, students dissect the focus statement of the Compare and Contrast Model Essay and practice introducing general comparisons. In Lesson 11, students analyze a reflection sentence from the conclusion of the Compare and Contrast Model Essay and imagine ways that books and movies can make people feel. In Lesson 14, students support their understanding of transitional language by focusing on a structure that adds extra information and can be moved to different parts of the sentence. A Language Dive empowers students to analyze, understand, and use the language of academic sentences, which often seems opaque to students. During a Language Dive, students slow down for 10–20 minutes to have a conversation about the meaning, purpose, and structure of a compelling sentence from a complex text, or from a learning target, checklist, or rubric included in the curriculum. Following the engaging deconstruct-reconstruct-practice routine of the Language Dive, students play with the smallest “chunks” of the sentence, interpreting them, rearranging them, or using them to talk about their own lives. As a result of paying close attention to how language works, all students begin to acquire the necessary facility with academic English, and ELLs foster their overall language ability. A consistent Language Dive routine is critical in helping all students learn how to decipher complex sentences and write their own.

Most Language Dives implicitly address a wide range of Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening, and Language standards. Once comfortable with Language Dives, supplement the focus standards in a particular Language Dive with additional standards to meet their students’ needs. Note that the Rationale section of each Language Dive also identifies supporting standards that are explicitly addressed but are not the main focus of the Language Dive.

Note: Some responses to questions in the Language Dive indicate only that “Responses will vary.” Like one of the larger goals of Language Dives, “Responses will vary” is intended to suggest that students should be encouraged to grapple with questions and ideas, develop interest and participation, and not be immediately steered toward “correct” responses. Indeed, even where correct responses are provided, continue to invite a culture of inquiry and grappling.

Diversity and Inclusion

Investigate the routines, practices, rituals, beliefs, norms, and experiences that are important to ELLs and their families. Integrate this background into the classroom as students engage with texts. Consider the values and narratives embedded in class texts, and try to anticipate their relevance to ELLs. Challenge students to identify and interrogate any problematic points of view and language of the author and narrator. Encourage and welcome critical questions, and guide students toward awareness and empathy. Foster inclusive action by creating space for students to express their feelings about sensitive issues or content embedded in the text(s), knowing that these discussions may help create equity, amplify student voices, and/or unearth trauma. Consult with a guidance counselor, school social worker, or ESL teacher for further investigation of diversity and inclusion.

Conversation Cues

Encourage productive and equitable conversation with Conversation Cues, which are questions that help students achieve four goals:

- (Goal 1) encourage all students to talk and be understood;

- (Goal 2) listen carefully to one another and seek to understand;

- (Goal 3) deepen thinking; and

- (Goal 4) think with others to expand the conversation (adapted from Michaels, Sarah and O’Connor, Cathy. *Talk Science Primer*.

Based on Chapin, S., O’Connor, C., and Anderson, N. *Classroom Discussions: Using Math Talk to Help Students Learn, Grades K–6*. Second Edition. Math Solutions Publications, 2009.)

Refer to the Tools Page (http://eled.org/tools) for the complete set of cues. Suggestions for integrating Goal 1 Conversation Cues into instruction are presented across lessons. For ELLs, Conversation Cues are especially critical because they improve language processing abilities and increase engagement and participation.

Strategic Grouping

As much as possible, facilitate opportunities in class for groups to discuss and complete content and tasks. In Unit 2, students may work in pairs and small groups to read the anchor text and plan the paragraphs for the essays they write during the end of unit assessment. Vary these groups so that ELLs have opportunities to interact with a wide variety of speakers in different situations, thus expanding the opportunity for language development. For particularly challenging tasks, think about strategically grouping ELLs with native and proficient English speakers. For more manageable tasks, interacting in homogeneous proficiency groups may promote English language development through grappling. At times, grouping speakers of the same home language may facilitate development of home language in association with content, boosting students’ connectedness to in-class material.

Compare and Contrast

Both the Mid-Unit 2 Assessment in Lesson 5 and the End of Unit 2 Assessment in Lessons 12-14 require students to analyze differences and similarities across thematically related media. In the mid-unit Assessment, students will compare and contrast themes from a selection of *The Lightning Thief* and a new Greek myth called “Prometheus.” Throughout Unit 2, students will have opportunities to practice identifying and tracking differences across texts and/or video clips using their note-catchers.

Identify Theme

Building on what students learned at the end of Unit 1, Lesson 1 of Unit 2 requires students to determine and analyze the theme(s) of a chapter of *The Lightning Thief*. Students continue to develop these skills through homework and in-class activities across early lessons of Unit 2. The mid-unit assessment in Lesson 5 will require students to choose among selected responses to analyze themes in *The Lightning Thief* and in the Greek myths that they read. The repeated opportunities for practice in the lessons preceding the mid-unit assessment will support ELLs, for whom extracting and discussing theme from complex texts may be especially challenging.

Write Summaries

Students are introduced to the skill of summarizing in Lesson 1. In Lessons 2 and 3, students practice writing summaries and receiving/reviewing feedback on those summaries. Help ELLs to understand the difference between objective reporting of key events in summaries and one’s own subjective analysis of theme through analysis and annotation of model summaries and peer critique. Provide ELLs with essential language that can be applied in their writing, including transition words that can help students when sharing details about plot and events.

Painted Essays®

In Lesson 11, students will be introduced to their first Painted Essay®. The Painted Essay® is a structure for expository writing that helps a writer make his or her thinking clear to the reader. At its most basic level, the Painted Essay® is a four-paragraph essay whose components (i.e., focus statement, Proof Paragraphs, and conclusion) are color-coded by the writer to signal their purpose to the reader. This flexible tool can be tweaked and adapted to match student level and/or accommodate various essay types. This exercise supports writing abilities for all students, but may be especially useful for ELLs as they navigate new structures and organize their ideas. In Unit 2, students will “paint” their compare and contrast essays, identifying and color-coding the essay’s focus statement(s), major points, reflection, etc.

Differentiated Note-Catchers

Differentiated note-catchers are available for ELLs and other students who would benefit from an increased level of support. These resources have been modified for the purposes of creating accessibility to content and concepts and supporting language development. Depending upon the task being carried out with a note-catcher, images, selected response options, answer banks, sentence frames, or model responses have been embedded to guide students’ thinking without compromising a focus on standards and the skills that students are developing and applying to meet them.

Celebration

Celebrate the courage, enthusiasm, diversity, and bilingual assets that ELLs bring to the classroom. Additionally, students can celebrate their successful attempts at communication and their ability to extend and enhance the discussions.
