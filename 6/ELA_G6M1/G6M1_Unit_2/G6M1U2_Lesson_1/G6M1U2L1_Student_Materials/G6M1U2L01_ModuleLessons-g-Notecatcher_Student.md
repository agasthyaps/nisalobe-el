**Directions:** The following text is the effective summary of chapter 13 from the text-dependent question task you just completed. The sentences have been numbered for you.

**\[1\]** In chapter 13, Percy, Grover, and Annabeth visit the St. Louis Arch. **\[2\]** The first part of the chapter describes the nervous feeling Percy has as he walks around the St. Louis Arch with Grover and Annabeth. **\[3\]** The second part of the chapter describes Percy’s fiery encounter with Echidna and the Chimera at the top of the arch, which ends in a dramatic cliffhanger as an injured Percy jumps off the arch and hopes that Poseidon will save him. **\[4\]** This chapter seems to convey the theme that heroes need to trust themselves, even if it means taking a big risk.
