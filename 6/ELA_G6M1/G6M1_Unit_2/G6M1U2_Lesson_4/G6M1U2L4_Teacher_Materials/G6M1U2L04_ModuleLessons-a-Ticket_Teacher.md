(For Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, read the learning targets. Then, consider the following theme: Sometimes a hero’s help comes when one least expects it.

Using pages 212–215 of chapter 14, find a piece of evidence that conveys that theme. Explain how your chosen evidence conveys the theme.

Answers will vary. Sample student response: One theme present in *The Lightning Thief* is the idea that a hero’s help comes when he or she least expects it. This is conveyed in chapter 14 when Percy plummets into the Mississippi River from atop the St. Louis Gateway Arch. Percy is sure the fall will kill him. However, when he lands in the water, he realizes that he has survived. Percy thinks, “I was breathing. I was underwater, and I was breathing normally \[. . .\] ‘Thank you . . . Father.’” The evidence shows that Percy did not die because he had demigod powers inherited from Poseidon. Percy receives unexpected help from Poseidon that saves his life when Percy thought that his life was over.
