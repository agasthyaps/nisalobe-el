**Directions:** Use the organizers to compare themes conveyed in the Greek Myths we read (“Theseus and the Minotaur,” “Cronus,” and “Medusa”) with those in *The Lightning Thief*. Choose two of the following themes, or come up with one of your own.

- A mother will put her love for her children above every other relationship.

- Those in power will do anything to stay in power.

- Those who anger or disobey the gods will be punished.

- Excessive pride can make a person act recklessly.

- Heroes often receive help in their quests.

- Even heroes can make mistakes.

<p><u>Quote A:</u> “Eager to let Ariadne know of his success, he followed the thread back to the entrance of the labyrinth. ‘You have slain the monster!’ cried Ariadne, clasping her hands. ‘Thanks to you, dear Ariadne,’ answered Theseus, ‘I return victorious.’”</p>
<p><u>Quote B:</u> “You will recall that Theseus’s father, King Egeus, had said to use white sails, instead of black ones, if Theseus were to return victorious. In the exuberance of his success, however, he forgot to alter the sails from black to white.”</p>
<p>I chose Quote ___. This quote shows the theme because . . .</p>
<p><strong>“Prince Theseus asked Ariadne to come with him. But the maiden said no. ‘My father is old, and has nobody but myself to love him.’ So he said farewell to Ariadne and set sail with the others. You will recall that Theseus’s father, King Egeus, had said to use white sails, instead of black ones, if Theseus were to return victorious. In the exuberance of his success, however, he forgot to alter the sails from black to white.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Theseus’s father, King Egeus, dies because Theseus forgets to change the black sails to white on the ship.</strong></p></td>

<p><u>Quote A:</u> “Go ahead, call me an idiot for walking into a strange lady’s shop like that just because I was hungry, but I do impulsive stuff sometimes.” (173)</p>
<p><u>Quote B:</u> “I slashed up with my sword, heard a sickening shlock!, then a hiss like wind rushing out of a cavern—the sound of a monster disintegrating.” (183)</p>

<p><strong>“Go ahead, call me an idiot for walking into a strange lady’s shop like that just because I was hungry, but I do impulsive stuff sometimes” (173).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Grover warns Percy several times about going into Aunty Em’s Garden Emporium. He even tells Percy that he smelled monsters. Percy allows his hunger for unhealthy food to cloud his judgment. As Grover warned, the trio discovers that Aunty Em’s is a dangerous place—the home of Medusa. A battle among the three demigods and the monster almost turns fatal for the heroes. Working together, they manage to defeat Medusa, but both Annabeth and Grover blame Percy for putting them in harm’s way.</strong></p></td>

Compare and contrast the way the theme is conveyed in the two texts.

One similarity is that both Theseus’s and Percy’s mistakes have consequences;  
Theseus loses his father as a result, and Percy’s poor judgment leads his friends into a dangerous situation.

One difference is that Theseus’s mistake results in death for his father, while  
Percy’s poor judgment doesn’t harm any of the protagonists of the story, yet.

Compare and contrast the way the theme is conveyed in the two texts.

One similarity is that both Medusa and Zeus were punished as a result of their own choices, knowing that they were using poor judgment.

One difference is that Medusa is held accountable for her own actions. In contrast, Zeus is not personally punished; instead, his innocent daughter suffers for Zeus’s mistake.
