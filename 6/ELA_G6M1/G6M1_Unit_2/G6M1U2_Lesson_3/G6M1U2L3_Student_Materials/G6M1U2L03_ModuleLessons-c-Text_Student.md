**Cronus**

Cronus was the son of Uranus and Gaea (Mother Earth). He was the youngest of the Titans. When Gaea gave birth to other children, such as Cyclops, who looked monstrous, Uranus was not proud of them and put them in a pit under the earth. This made Gaea very angry, and she asked Cronus and his Titan brothers to rise up against their father and save their other brothers. Cronus did overthrow his father, but he did not save his monstrous brothers. Gaea, who loved all of her children, was so angry that Cronus did not help his brothers that she began to plan Cronus’s ruin.

Cronus was the god of time. He married his sister Rhea, and together they had three sons and three daughters. Cronus was afraid that his children might one day rise up against him, as he had against his own father, Uranus. His father had predicted that this would happen. To ensure he kept his power and the prophecy did not come true, Cronus swallowed each child as soon as they were born.

This filled his wife Rhea with sorrow and anger. When it came to Zeus, her sixth and last child, Rhea was determined to save this one child at least, to love and cherish. She asked her parents, Uranus and Gaea, for advice and assistance. They told her to wrap a stone in baby-clothes and give it to Cronus. She did, and he swallowed the stone without noticing the deception.

Anxious to keep the secret of his existence from Cronus, Rhea sent the infant Zeus to Crete, where he was fed, protected, and educated. Priests beat their shields together to make a constant noise to drown out the cries of the child and frighten away all intruders.

Once he grew into a man, Zeus was determined to make his father give back his brothers and sisters. The goddess Metis helped him by convincing Cronus to drink a potion, which caused him to expel the children he had swallowed. Cronus was so enraged that the father and son went to war. Zeus eventually dethroned his father Cronus, who was banished from his kingdom and had his supreme power taken away. Zeus became supreme god.
