(For Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, read the learning targets. Then work with a partner to state a theme that is conveyed by *The Lightning Thief*. Include details from the text that reveal this theme.

Answers will vary. Sample student response: Sometimes a hero’s help comes when he or she least expects it. For example, just as Percy is about to be turned to stone by Medusa, Grover comes flying in on his winged shoes and whacks Medusa with a tree branch.
