<p><strong>The myth of “Cronus” tells the story of how Zeus defeated his father, Cronus, and became the supreme God. Cronus defeated his own father at his mother’s request, but he did not save all of his brothers as he promised. When Cronus married Rhea, he was so afraid that his own children would try to defeat him that he ate all of his children. Rhea was able to save one, Zeus, and Zeus was able to retrieve his brothers and sisters and defeat Cronus. This myth suggests the theme that a mother’s love for her children is strong, since both Gaea and Rhea sought to protect their children from their fathers, who treated the children poorly and only wanted power.</strong></p></td>

Medusa angered the goddess Athena by being both beautiful and disloyal when she broke her vow as a priestess and married Poseidon. Athena punished Medusa by turning her into a monster with snakes for hair and sending Perseus to kill her. This myth suggests the theme that excessive pride can make one act recklessly.
