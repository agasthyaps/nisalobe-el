Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RL.6.1 – Work Time A: Students read the next chapter of the text and find the gist. Students also unpack unfamiliar vocabulary and answer comprehension questions using inferences and evidence from text.

- RL.6.1 – Work Time B: Students participate in a close read, in which they use evidence from “Theseus and the Minotaur” to support their analysis of the myth and the inferences they draw from it. The Close Reading Guide lists the text excerpts, key questions to ask students, and instructional moves required. Continue to use discussion protocols (e.g., Think-Pair-Share, Conversation Cues, and total participation techniques) to engage all students in a collaborative discussion about the text.

- RL.6.2 – Work Time B: During the close read, students discuss the central idea(s) and themes of “Theseus and the Minotaur.”

- RL.6.2 – Closing and Assessment A: Students work in pairs to write their own summary of the Greek myth analyzed during the close read.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- The Greek myth provided with this lesson has been rewritten to reflect an average Grade 6 reading level. Provide a more complex version of the story for students reading at a higher level.

- Challenge students to generate questions about the myth before asking the prepared questions.

- Support background building on Greek mythological figures by viewing a video such as (http://eled.org/0104).

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students read chapter 13 of *The Lightning Thief* and began to pull text evidence to support a particular theme represented in the text. They also analyzed a model summary which they will use for guidance as they practice writing their own summary in this lesson.

Support All Students

- Students may need additional support with recording their answers on their note-catchers. Work with those students in a small group to give more support. ▲

- Students may be surprised or upset by the description of the scene at the St. Louis Gateway Arch as a possible terrorist attack. Time for debriefing and reflection might help get these concerns out into the open so they can be addressed and tracked throughout the text.

- Students may struggle to adjust to the language/organization of the close read, which is different from much they have already read. Remind students of the reading and vocabulary strategies they have practiced in class. ▲

- Writing a complete summary in 10 minutes may be challenging for some students (especially since they have mostly written gists, which are less organized). Think about strategically grouping writers of varying proficiency levels. ▲

- Be mindful of differences in experience with source attributions during summary writing. Make sure that students are aware that ideas can be borrowed from the original text, but that they must use their own words to explain ideas when they write, and they must place quotation marks around the quotes they borrow and explain where they came from. ▲

- Consider diversity and inclusion when reading and discussing Greek myths. Ask about, research, acknowledge, celebrate, and incorporate student knowledge, languages, beliefs, and skills; compare and contrast students’ cultures and background to those introduced in Greek myths. ▲

- This lesson supports ELLs with a close read of a Greek myth, which further cultivates students’ understanding of theme. Additionally, this lesson features the first summary writing of Unit 2. This task is completed in pairs, giving ELLs added peer support.

- ELLs may find it challenging to write their first summary, which requires that they integrate both reading and writing skills while minding conventions of source attribution and citation. Encourage them to revisit the model summary as a reference, and provide as many examples as possible.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.B.6, 6.I.C.10, and 6.II.A.1.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ Close Reading Culminating Task: “Theseus and the Minotaur” recording forms to ensure students understand how to identify theme and an effective summary.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will read more stories of Greek figures, specifically those referenced in the anchor text. Using a Jigsaw protocol, students will apply the close reading skills they practice in this lesson to the text they analyze in a smaller group setting. They will also write a summary using the skills they have practiced in the first two lessons of the unit.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Review the student tasks and example answers to get familiar with what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Record the following on the board for students as they arrive:

- Review or complete your summary homework answers with a partner, revising as necessary. Be ready to share with the large group.

- Preview the Close Reading Guide: “Theseus and the Minotaur” and Close Reading Culminating Task: “Theseus and the Minotaur” to get familiar with what will be required of students.

- Preread chapter 14 in *The Lightning Thief* to identify words or plot points that may challenge students.

- Prepare copies of handouts for students (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time B: Use a search engine to gather several visuals to enhance reading of the “Theseus and the Minotaur” myth. Many images of figures from Greek mythology are not school-appropriate; preview images first before displaying them to the class.

- Closing and Assessment A: Allow students to collaborate on their summary with a partner using a web-based word-processing tool, such as Google Docs.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RL.6.2 (5 minutes)

- Direct students to the posted directions on the board, then read them aloud.

“Review or complete your summary homework answers with a partner, revising as necessary. Be ready to share with the large group.”

- Facilitate a quick review of the sample summaries and what’s missing from each.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

- With students, use the vocabulary strategies on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart** to deconstruct the words *opinion* and *judgment* (belief; viewpoint, idea). Record on the **academic word wall** with translations in home languages, where appropriate, ▲ and invite students to record the words in their **vocabulary logs**.

- Turn and Talk:

“What do you think you will be doing in this lesson based on these learning targets?” (We are going to be reading a Greek myth, determining its theme, and writing a summary of it.)

“Why are we doing this? How is it meaningful to you? How will it help you to be successful?” (Reading the actual Greek myths referenced in the novel will help the reader to better understand the plot and characters, as well as the message the author is trying to convey in the novel.)

Work Time

A. Read *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 14 Excerpt – RL.6.1 (15 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Read aloud the selected excerpt, using the **Text Guide: *The Lightning Thief*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Refer to the following resources as appropriate to support this section of the lesson: **Gist Record: *The Lightning Thief*** **anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**, vocabulary logs, **chapter synopsis**, and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Excerpt: starting at page 212 “I’d love to tell you . . . ”and ending at page 215 “ . . . and swam for the surface.”

- Gist: Percy falls into the water and realizes he can breathe underwater. A water spirit brings him a message that there is still hope for his mom.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

B. Close Read: “Theseus and the Minotaur” – RL.6.2 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can determine a theme and how it is conveyed through details in ‘Theseus and the Minotaur’.”

- Focus students on the Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart, and remind them that digging into the text deeper can help them understand it better, so they are going to dig deeper into an excerpt from the text through close reading.

- Move students into predetermined triads.

- Direct students’ attention to the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**, and review what collaboration looks and sounds like.

- Use **Close Reading Guide: “Theseus and the Minotaur” (for teacher reference)** to set the purpose of the close read and to guide students through a close read of this excerpt. Refer to the guide for how to integrate the following:

- **Text: “Theseus and the Minotaur”**

- **Close Reading Culminating Task: “Theseus and the Minotaur”**

- **Affix list**

- Refer to **Close Reading Culminating Task: “Theseus and the Minotaur” (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Reconvene the class after students complete questions 1 and 2 on the Close Reading Culminating Task recording form.

- Explain that they’ll complete item 3 in the next segment.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- In preparation for the mid-unit assessment in Lesson 5, help students identify strategies for reading unfamiliar texts. Invite them to practice these strategies when reading the Greek myth in Work Time B. Examples:

- Chunk the text into manageable amounts (e.g., sentences or paragraphs).

- Circle unfamiliar words.

- Use context or a dictionary to define unfamiliar words.

- Annotate unfamiliar words with synonyms.

- Underline important people, places, and things.

- Read aloud.

- Read repeatedly.

- Silently paraphrase the chunks.

- Summarize what you read for someone else, perhaps first in your home language

Closing and Assessment

A. Pair Write: Summary – RL.6.2 (10 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can write a summary of ‘Theseus and the Minotaur’ without personal opinions or judgments.”

- Explain that now students will continue analyzing the story, working with a partner to write a summary of it, which is item 3 on **Close Reading Culminating Task: “Theseus and the Minotaur.”** Display the **Criteria for an Effective Summary anchor chart**. Remind students that they can use the anchor chart and the model summary from Lesson 1 as they write.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- Provide students with examples of summary sentences alongside original texts to demonstrate what does and does not constitute plagiarism. Encourage students to generate overarching guidelines for summary writing and paraphrasing (e.g., *change vocabulary and sentence structure when writing someone else’s ideas*) based on the examples.

For Heavier Support

- If there is time to do so, separate the Pair Write into two parts. In the first part, group ELLs of the same home language to discuss and confirm the meaning of the Greek myth; then, pair ELLs with native or proficient English speakers to write the summary.

Homework

A. Compare and Contrast Themes

- Students complete **Homework: Compare and Contrast Themes: “Theseus and the Minotaur” and *The Lightning Thief***.

B. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their independent reading journal.
