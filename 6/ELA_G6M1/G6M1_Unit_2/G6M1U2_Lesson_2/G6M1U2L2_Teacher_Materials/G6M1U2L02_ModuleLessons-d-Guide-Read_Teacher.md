Close Reading Guide:  
“Theseus and the Minotaur”

RL.6.1, RL.6.2, RL.6.4, L.6.4

(For Teacher Reference)

**Purpose and Notes**

- The purpose of this close read is for students to determine the theme of a myth and identify how the theme is conveyed in the text. Students will use this information to write a summary as part of the closing of Lesson 2.

- Although there is a lot of challenging vocabulary in this text, this close read focuses only on words needed to understand how the theme is conveyed. Support with definitions of additional words as needed for basic comprehension.

- The vocabulary questions in this close read have been designed to reinforce the strategies introduced in previous lessons. Encourage students to make these connections and to use a wide range of strategies to understand key words and phrases.

- There is no note-catcher for this close read; rather, students answer two multiple choice questions and write a partner summary on the Culminating Task recording form.

- Continue to use discussion protocols (e.g., Think-Pair-Share, Conversation Cues, and total participation techniques) to engage all students in collaborative discussion about the text.

<td><ul>
<li><p>Focus students on the section titled “The Mighty Minotaur.” Briefly explain that they will be looking more closely at some sections of the myth in order to determine the theme. If necessary, remind students that a theme is a big idea, or an observation about life or human behavior. The theme is rooted in the text but goes beyond it.</p></li>
<li><p>Explain that in order to determine theme, readers need to pay careful attention to character development and the key events in the text. Tell students that they are going to reread portions of this myth to better understand Theseus and the important events that convey the theme of this myth.</p></li>

<li><p>Ask: “So what might this series of events tell you about Theseus’s character?” (He was a bit foolish; he forgot an important instruction given by his father because he was so focused on his victory against the Minotaur.)</p></li>

<li><p>Ask: “What did King Egeus think when he saw the ship sailing toward him?” (that Theseus was dead) “What makes the reader think that?” (The sails were still black; Egeus thought Theseus was devoured, which means eaten.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “What did King Egeus do as a result?” (jumped off the cliff and drowned) “Why did King Egeus die?” (because Theseus forgot to raise the flag)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask: “How did you feel when you read that King Egeus jumped off the cliff?” (Answers will vary; surprised, upset, angry, that it was unfair.)</p></li>
<li><p>“What big idea about human behavior might we draw from what happened to Theseus?” (Even heroes can make serious mistakes. No one can escape tragedy.)</p></li>
<li><p>Tell students they will now think about what they have learned about Theseus as a character and the key events of the myth to determine the theme.</p></li>
