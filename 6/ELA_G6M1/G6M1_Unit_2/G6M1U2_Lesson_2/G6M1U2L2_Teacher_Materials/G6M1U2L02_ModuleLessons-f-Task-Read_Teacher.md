“Theseus and the Minotaur” tells how Theseus won the battle over the dreadful Minotaur. Theseus was an ambitious, brave prince who offered to sail to Crete to fight the monster. Before he left, his father, King Egeus, instructed Theseus to change the sails on the ship from black to white if he won the battle over the Minotaur. King Egeus said he would be watching for the white sails until his son returned. When Theseus arrived in King Minos’s land where the Minotaur lived, he met the king’s daughter, Ariadne.

Ariadne showed Theseus to the labyrinth where the Minotaur lived. Theseus successfully defeated the mighty Minotaur, but in his excitement about the victory, forgot to change the sails to white as his father had ordered. When King Egeus climbed to the top of the cliff and saw the black sails, he was so devastated about losing his son that he jumped into the ocean and drowned, which conveys the theme that even heroes make fatal mistakes.
