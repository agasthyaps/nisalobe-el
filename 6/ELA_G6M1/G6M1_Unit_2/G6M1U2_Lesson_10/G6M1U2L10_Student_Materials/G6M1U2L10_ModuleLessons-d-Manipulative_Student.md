<td>In the movie, Percy, Grover, and Annabeth find the warehouse empty (Columbus). In the novel, they are greeted by “Aunty Em,” who turns out to be Medusa. She seems like a nice old lady and feeds them (Riordan 173). This introduction to Medusa in the novel doesn’t build suspense. In contrast, in the movie, when the three split up to explore the empty warehouse, the viewer knows something bad is going to happen (Columbus).</td>

more action to the scene.</td>

<td>There are also differences in the battle with Medusa. In the novel, Grover uses his flying shoes to hit Medusa from above and rescue Percy (Riordan 180). In the movie, Annabeth drives a truck through the warehouse to knock Medusa down. This gives Percy the chance to cut off her head with his sword (Columbus). The truck is unexpected and causes a lot of destruction. This difference provides a quick solution to the problem.</td>

<td>Although the outcome is the same<br />
in both, the plot of the scene in<br />
the novel and movie is different.</td>
