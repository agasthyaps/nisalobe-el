Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.6.2b – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they review the plans for their first Proof Paragraphs.

- RL.6.1 – Work Time A: Students read the next chapter of the text and find the gist. Students also unpack unfamiliar vocabulary and answer comprehension questions using inferences and evidence from text.

- RL.6.1 – Work Time B: Students plan the second Proof Paragraph of their essays, using evidence from *The Lightning Thief* to support their ideas. Students will apply their learning from the Painted Essay® structure to describe the differences between the novel and the film. Students will practice organizing the facts, concrete details, and examples into a coherent structure.

- RL.6.7 – Work Time B: Students plan the second Proof Paragraph of an essay, in which they contrast the experience of reading a scene in a story with the experience of watching the same scene in a film.

- W.6.2b – Work Time B: Students develop the topic of their essays in their second Proof Paragraphs using relevant facts, concrete details, quotations, and examples.

- W.6.4 – Work Time B: Using the Compare and Contrast Model Essay as guidance, students organize a clear and coherent second Proof Paragraph with attention to task, purpose, and audience.

- W.6.5 – Work Time B: Students receive some support as they strengthen their writing by thoughtfully planning the second Proof Paragraph of their essays.

- W.6.9a – Work Time B: Students apply Grade 6 Reading standards to literature by comparing and contrasting a video clip and its corresponding scene in the text.

- RL.6.7 – Closing and Assessment A: Students share their plans with a partner and give and receive feedback on the connections drawn across the text and film.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Challenge proficient writers to try more advanced writing techniques like adding direct quotes, pulling in additional sources, or using figurative language and vivid words, especially the vocabulary they have added to their vocabulary logs.

- Check the Language standards to identify additional goals for a proficient writer to work toward (e.g., utilizing punctuation to set off nonrestrictive/parenthetical elements).

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the second half of this unit, students have been analyzing a model and using their analysis to plan an informative essay and plan the introduction and Proof Paragraph 1. This lesson continues those routines to plan the second Proof Paragraph.

Support All Students

- Students may be surprised or upset by the description of the Underworld in chapter 18. Note that the Underworld as depicted in Greek mythology is not the same as the Christian view of hell, a place of punishment for sinners. Draw attention to page 291 of *The Lightning Thief*, which describes the different areas of the Underworld, including a place of reward for those who lived good lives.

- Students may need additional support while writing their Proof Paragraphs. Group those students for a discussion that will guide them in finding and explaining evidence to support their points. ▲

- Think about providing opportunities for students to interact and discuss what they want to include in their Proof Paragraphs before they begin planning independently.

- Error correction and celebration are two other high-leverage supports to consider. If possible, think about isolating and discussing one or two common errors within the first and second Proof Paragraphs; or locate and celebrate one or two samples of growth, if readily available. ▲

- Think about providing opportunities for students to interact and discuss what they want to include in their Proof Paragraphs before they begin planning independently.

- To support ELLs, this lesson repeats familiar tasks from the previous lesson, which improves student confidence and preparedness, and directs students toward the goal of completing organized and effective essays.

- ELLs may find it challenging to provide further textual evidence that supports the focus statements of their essays. Encourage them to take time to revisit the text and the Compare and Contrast Model Essay for examples.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.C.10, 6.I.C.11, and 6.II.C.1.

Assessment Guidance

- Use the Informative Writing checklist to assess students’ writing abilities in Work Time B.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will finish planning their compare and contrast essay, focusing on their conclusion in preparation to write their final draft for the End of Unit 2 Assessment.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.6.2b (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 10**. Allow time for students to share their star and step with their partner and for their partner to respond.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

- Direct students’ attention to the **Criteria for an Effective Informative Essay anchor chart**, and read each bullet point aloud.

Work Time

A. Read *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 18 Excerpt – RL.6.1 (20 minutes)

- Repeated Routine: Read aloud the selected excerpt, using the **Text Guide: *The Lightning Thief*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Refer to the following resources as appropriate to support this section of the lesson: **Gist Record: *The Lightning Thief*** **anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**, **vocabulary logs**, **chapter synopsis**, and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Excerpt: starting on page 291 “I’m not sure what I was expecting . . . ” and ending at the conclusion of the chapter on page 299 “ . . . longing for his new friend.”

- Gist: The trio enters the Underworld and meets Charon, the ferryman across the River Styx. Cerberus, the three-headed dog, can detect those who are not dead; Annabeth plays fetch with him so Percy can sneak in to see Hades.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- The supports in this lesson are similar to the supports in Lesson 9, as the tasks and/or focus of these lessons are similar. Based on student performance in Lesson 9, release students from some of the supports applied in those lessons to foster independence and to assess student progress.

Work Time

B. Plan Proof Paragraph 2 – W.6.2b (15 minutes)

- Review the learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can compare and contrast what I see and hear when I read the text to what I perceive when I watch the same scene of the movie.”

“I can plan the second Proof Paragraph of a compare and contrast essay.”

- Move students into predetermined pairs.

- Distribute **blue construction paper** and **Organize the Model: Proof Paragraph 2 strips**.

- Invite students to refer to their **Painted Essay® template** to remember where Proof Paragraph 2 fits in the structure of an informational piece.

- Remind students that the yellow paragraph is about similarities and the blue paragraph is about differences.

- Read aloud Proof Paragraph 1 of the **Compare and Contrast Model Essay** again to remind students where the writer left off, before transitioning into the second Proof Paragraph.

- Post and review the following directions:

- Read and lay out the sentence strips on the blue construction paper.

- Organize each set of strips logically as they would appear in Proof Paragraph 2. (Remind students that the paragraph should begin with a topic sentence, end with a concluding sentence, and include relevant evidence from the text.)

- Check your work against the Compare and Contrast Model Essay.

- Invite students to begin working, and circulate to support them in reading and sorting the strips.

- Refocus whole group.

- Have students choral read Proof Paragraph 2. ▲

- For each sentence strip, ask:

“What is the purpose of this sentence or group of sentences?”

- Listen for students to notice that the topic sentence tells the readers that Proof Paragraph 2 is about the differences, related evidence is grouped together and all relates back to the topic sentence, and the concluding sentence explains the significance of the points made in the paragraph.

- Invite students to help record any new criteria for Proof Paragraph 2 on the Criteria for an Effective Informative Essay anchor chart. Refer to **Criteria for an Effective Informative Essay anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** as necessary. Point out that transition words and phrases help segue between paragraphs.

- Invite students to retrieve and read their **Informative/Explanatory Writing Plan graphic organizer** started in a previous lesson to remind them of their focus statement and their ideas before planning their own Proof Paragraph 2.

- Invite students to refer to their **Compare and Contrast Film and Text: *The Lightning Thief*** **note-catcher**, Compare and Contrast Model Essay, the criteria on the Criteria for an Effective Informative Essay anchor chart, the **Informative Writing checklist**, and the **domain-specific word wall** to plan Proof Paragraph 2. Remind students that, at this time, they are only planning, not drafting, Proof Paragraph 2. If needed, model filling out this part of the Informative/Explanatory Writing Plan graphic organizer using the information in the **Annotated Compare and Contrast Model Essay (for teacher reference)**.

- Circulate to support students as they work and to identify common issues to use as whole group teaching points.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.
