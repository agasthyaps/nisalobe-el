Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Work Time A: Students complete the End of Unit 2 Assessment, in which they compose the four-paragraph essay they have planned comparing and contrasting the Lotus-Eaters scene from the film version of *The Lightning Thief* with the same scene in the novel. Two lessons have been allocated for this assessment to ensure sufficient time for students to complete the essay. If these are taught in two separate lessons rather than together as one block, revisit the learning targets and the task at the beginning of the second 45-minute lesson to remind students of the task and purpose. Be sure to collect all written work at the end of each session. (RL.6.1, RL.6.7, W.6.2, W.6.4, W.6.5, W.6.6, W.6.9a, W.6.10, L.6.2b, L.6.6)

- W.6.2 – Closing and Assessment A: Students reflect on their learning using the Track Progress: Informative Writing recording form. This exercise is meant to provide them with time to formally keep track of and reflect on their own learning. This self-reflection supports metacognition and pride in work and learning.

- The independent research reading that students complete for homework will help build both their vocabulary and knowledge pertaining to Greek mythology. By participating in this volume of reading over a span of time, students will develop a wide base of knowledge about the world and the words that help describe and make sense of it.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Some students may not require the level of scaffolding provided in this unit. Prompt students toward deeper levels of understanding and increased rigor by referencing Levels 3 and 4 of Webb’s Depth of Knowledge.

- Guide students in an informal discussion of when the skills of comparing and contrasting or writing informative texts might be important in a “real-world” setting. Prompt students with suggestions, like considering which apartment to rent or when a police officer needs to write an incident report.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the second half of this unit, students have been analyzing a model and using their analysis to plan an informative essay. This lesson assesses those skills as students use their plans to compose their essays comparing a scene from the film version of *The Lightning Thief* to the same scene in the novel.

Support All Students

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment.

- This lesson supports ELLs with opportunities to demonstrate their content and language knowledge through a compare and contrast essay built on their preparation and practice in previous lessons. They self-assess at the end of the lesson in order to celebrate their successes and identify areas of growth.

- ELLs may find it challenging to write their compare and contrast essays for the End of Unit 2 Assessment, as this requires a leap from planning and note-taking to production with far less scaffolded support than during class time. Before they begin, encourage students to do their best, and congratulate them on the progress they have made learning English. Point out some specific examples of their successes.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.C.12, 6.II.B.3, 6.II.B.4, and 6.II.B.5.

Assessment Guidance

- End of Unit 2 Assessment: Compare and Contrast Essay (student and teacher version) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- Save a copy of the scored essays to use as a baseline assessment. These pieces can be used to measure the progress of individual students throughout the year, as well as to identify common instructional needs in a class.

- When assessing and providing feedback to students on this assessment, use the Informative Writing Rubric (see Module 1 Teacher Guide: Appendix and/or Tools Page, https://eled.org/tools) and the annotated sample essay to help complete the student Track Progress: Informative Writing. Make notes in the appropriate column for each criterion in a different color from student responses. There is also space provided to respond to student comments.

- Decide in what format students will compose their essays. Provide lined paper or a computer with word-processing software, depending on students’ needs and preferences.

- In this assessment, students are tracking progress toward anchor standard CCRA.W.2: Write informative/explanatory texts to examine and convey complex ideas and information clearly and accurately through the effective selection, organization, and analysis of content.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will engage in another Language Dive, this time focused on appropriate transitions. They will apply their learning as they revise their essays to make connections between points. Students will also be introduced to the Peer Critique protocol, in which they pair up with another peer to critique transitions, domain-specific vocabulary words, and correct spelling.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Thoroughly review the directions and rubric for the End of Unit 2 Assessment, anticipating areas of struggle that may arise.

- Review the student tasks and example answers to get familiar with what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Ensure Mid Unit 2 Assessments with feedback are available for each student at desks as they enter.

- Decide in what format students will compose their essays. Provide lined paper or a device with word-processing software, depending on the students’ needs and preferences. Ensure that devices are in good working order, fully charged, and logged into before students begin composing their essays, to avoid wasting work time.

- Prepare copies of handouts for students (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time A: Students complete essay online using a tool such as http://eled.org/0158.

- Closing and Assessment A: Students complete their Track Progress handouts in a word-processing document using speech-to-text facilities activated on devices or using an app or software such as http://eled.org/0103.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Return Mid-Unit 2 Assessments (5 minutes)

- As students enter the classroom, return students’ **Mid-Unit 2 Assessments with feedback**. Direct students to write their name on the board if they need an explanation for the feedback provided.

Opening

B. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

- Remind students that they have seen this learning target in the previous lessons. Invite students to discuss what they think they will be doing in this lesson and the purpose of this work.

Work Time

A. End of Unit 2 Assessment: Write Compare and Contrast Essay (65 minutes)

- Distribute **devices** with word-processing capabilities or **lined paper** on which students will compose their essay.

- Invite students to retrieve the following materials:

- **Compare and Contrast Film and Text: *The Lightning Thief***

- **Completed Informative/Explanatory Writing Plan graphic organizer**

- **Informative Writing checklist**

- **Compare and Contrast model essay**

- ***The Lightning Thief*** **(text)**

- **Painted Essay® template**

- Direct students to also reference the **Criteria for an Effective Informative Essay anchor chart**, as needed. Display and distribute the **Module 1: End of Unit 2 Assessment: Compare and Contrast Essay Directions**.

- Read Part I aloud as students follow along, reading silently. Make sure students understand the assessment directions; paraphrase some instructions, if needed. ▲

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence. Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**, and review perseverance and what this looks and sounds like. Remind students that as they will be writing independently for the assessment, they may need to practice perseverance.

- Remind students that they planned this essay in the previous lessons.

- Invite students to begin the assessment.

- While students are taking the assessment, circulate to monitor and document their test-taking skills. As this assessment takes place over two periods, offer students a time warning before collecting them at the end of the first period. Redistribute the assessments for the next period.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

- Repeat, inviting students to self-assess how well they persevered in this lesson.

For Lighter Support

- Before students begin writing their essays, display appropriate writing goals for individual students (e.g., *two pages*). Place a star or sticker at the goal point so they can self-monitor their progress as they write.

- During the End of Unit 2 Assessment, encourage students to take advantage of the planning they have already done and begin writing immediately so that they have enough time to complete their essays.
