End of Unit 2 Assessment: Compare and Contrast Essay

(Example for Teacher Reference)

**Part I: Write an Essay**

Use all rows on the Grade 6 Informative/Explanatory Writing rubric and the sample proficient response to assess student writing. Save a copy of the scored essays to use as a baseline assessment. These pieces can be used to measure the progress of individual students throughout the year, as well as to identify common instructional needs in a class. Evidence of mastery of the Reading standards should be recorded in row “A” of the rubric.

Sample Proficient Response: Scorepoint 3, for Teacher Reference:

W.6.2a: Effectively communicated and strongly maintained focus. Focus statement explains essay topic.  
  
  
  
  
W.6.2a: Clear, logical progression with strong connections between and among ideas. Paragraph links to first part of focus statement about similarities.  
  
  
  
  
W.6.2b: Effectively uses various elaborative techniques. Quoted and paraphrased evidence from novel and movie is integrated, relevant, and specific.

What if it were up to you to prevent a war among the three most powerful Greek gods? What if you and your two closest friends found yourselves on a dangerous journey to restore peace? That’s exactly what happens to Percy Jackson in *The Lightning Thief* by Rick Riordan. In both the book and the movie, Percy is a relatively normal twelve-year-old boy who finds out he is the son of the Greek God Poseidon. Wrongly accused of stealing Zeus’s lightning bolt, Percy and his friends go on a quest to find it and return it to Zeus. Along the way, they encounter challenges and difficulty but are able to persevere. One challenge they face is getting caught at The Lotus Casino on their way to Los Angeles. A comparison of the end of chapter 16 of the book and the same scene of the movie reveals both similarities and differences.

Much of what happens in the movie and the book when Percy, Grover, and Annabeth arrive at the Lotus Hotel and Casino is the same. The novel describes the three friends walking up to the hotel, where the “entrance was a huge neon flower, the petals lighting up and blinking. No one was going in or out, but the glittering chrome doors were open, spilling out air-conditioning that smelled like flowers—lotus blossom . . .” (257). Similarly, in the movie, we see the trio outside a bright, wild, loud, and enticing building with everything one might want, from food to fun. In both versions, once inside, they all get caught up in everything that the Lotus has to offer. In both, Percy is the one who realizes what is happening. He works to break the spell he and his friends have been under. In both, they escape so that they can keep focused on their larger goal and continue their journey west. In a movie that is, overall, very different from the novel, keeping much of this scene the same makes the movie instantly recognizable to anyone who has read the book.

W.6.2c: Appropriate transitions create cohesion and clarify relationships among ideas and concepts. *Although* transitions from similarities and links to next paragraph about differences.

W.6.2b: Effectively uses various elaborative techniques. Evidence from source material is integrated, relevant, and specific. Impact of differences on the viewer is described in detail.

W.6.2a: Well-chosen formatting, graphics, or multimedia enhances comprehension. Format follows Painted Essay® structure; predictable structure enhances comprehension.

W.6.2f: Conclusion follows from and supports information or explanation and offers ideas about impact on viewer.  
  
  
  
  
W.6.4, W.6.2e: Establishes and maintains formal style and objective tone. The word *I* isn’t used. Mostly compound and complex sentences.

Although the setting and outcome is the same in both, the characters of Grover and Annabeth are very different. In the book, Grover is awkward and self-conscious. He is described as “scrawny,” “with acne and the start of a wispy beard on his chin,” and “an easy target.” In the film version, Grover is filled with confidence. He is the center of attention as he performs onstage, singing and dancing with swagger. The change in Grover’s character makes him less relatable to readers who are also self-conscious and makes him more like a stereotypical teenage boy. Likewise, in the film, Annabeth is just interested in gambling, snacking, and dancing. In the novel, Annabeth is very different. She is captivated by “brainiac stuff,” like watching *National Geographic*, playing trivia games, and building a holographic city. One of Annabeth’s main strengths is her intelligence. This is clearer in the novel than in the film, where her intelligence is not highlighted as much. The film reduces the complexities of these two characters. It is harder to see the qualities that define their characters and solidify the trio’s friendship.

This scene in both the book and the movie revolves around Riordan’s strong setting and how they become trapped in the Lotus Casino. Although the way the characters are depicted is very different, the outcome of the scene is the same. In both the novel and the film version, the three friends eventually figure out what’s happening and work together to leave the hotel to return to their important quest. Perhaps the biggest similarity between the book and the movie is the feeling of strength and power both readers and viewers experience as they make this fantastic journey alongside Percy and his friends.
