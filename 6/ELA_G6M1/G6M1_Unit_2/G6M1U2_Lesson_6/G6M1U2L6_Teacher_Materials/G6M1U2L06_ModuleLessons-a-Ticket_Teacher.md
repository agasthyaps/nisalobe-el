Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 6

W.6.10

(For Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** As you enter class, read the learning targets. Then complete the following task.

When a book is adapted into a movie, screenwriters and directors need to make strategic choices about what to keep and what to change from the original text.

- Write one way that movies are usually the same as the books on which they are based.

- Write one way that movies often differ from their books.

Answers will vary. Sample student responses:

Same — Many of the main characters remain, and the basic plot stays the same. The screenwriter may also include exact dialogue from the book in the film script.

Different — Directors may change the plot to create more suspense, or to fit the main plot events into the time allotted for the film. Characters may have to be cut to save money that would go toward hiring actors. Directors might also update the story by adding more diverse characters.
