Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RL.6.4 – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket, in which they determine the meaning of a word as it is used in the text.

- L.6.4 – Opening A: Students apply vocabulary strategies to make a determination about an unknown word’s meaning.

- RL.6.1 – Work Time A: Students read the next chapter of the text and find the gist. Students also unpack unfamiliar vocabulary and answer comprehension questions using inferences and evidence from text.

- RL.6.7 – Work Time B: Students view a clip of the film version of *The Lightning Thief* and engage in a compare and contrast activity, noting similarities and differences between the scene in the film and the same scene in the text. The interplay of reading, rereading, and viewing is an engaging way to present this material, and it helps readers make sense of a complex text. (Note: Do not play the entire film for students. Strategically designed lessons incorporate film at critical junctures in student learning.)

- W.6.5 – Work Time B: Students capture responses on a note-catcher intended to help them plan their essays.

- W.6.9a – Work Time B: Students draw evidence from a scene *The Lightning Thief* to support their analysis of that scene and the same scene in the film.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Give students a blank Informative Writing checklist, and challenge them to generate the criteria based on the model essay.

- Point students to the sentence on page 247 of *The Lightning Thief*: “I was a source of amusement for the gods.” Challenge students to compare the human-god relationship as it portrayed in Greek myths to this same relationship in other cultures and religions.

- Use Goal 1 Conversation Cues to provoke critical thinking during this analysis.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students analyzed a model essay using the Painted Essay® structure to generate criteria for their own essays. In preparation to write their own compare and contrast essay, students will now read the next chapter in the novel and watch another scene from the film.

Support All Students

- Note there is a differentiated version of the Model Compare and Contrast Film and Text: *The Lightning Thief* note-catcher used in Work Time. ▲

- Students may be surprised or upset by the description of the deplorable conditions in which the animals are kept. Time for debriefing and reflection might help get these concerns out into the open so they can be addressed and tracked throughout the text.

- During the viewing of the film scene, the main characters eat lotus flowers. The effect of the flowers replicates that of drug use. Be aware that this representation of drug use may be upsetting or confusing for some students.

- Comparing and contrasting the movie scene may be difficult for some students. Think about strategic grouping, modeling, or offering guiding questions on the note-catcher. Additionally, scaffold their experience with the movie clip by turning on the closed-captioning feature or encouraging active note-taking. Make the film available ahead of time to allow students to preview it a few times before discussing it in class. ▲

- The basic design of this lesson supports ELLs by asking students to consider ways in which a clip from the film version of *The Lightning Thief* is similar to or different from the related scene of the text. This exercise allows for better integration of visual and textual content, reinforces students’ understanding of what they have read, and prepares them to write their own compare and contrast essays as part of the end of unit assessment.

- ELLs may find it challenging to process and understand the film scene after a single viewing. Support students’ comprehension of the film with captions, and make the scene available to students before and/or after class so that they have the option to review it independently. Reiterate that they do not need to understand every word to begin to identify similarities and differences. Find opportunities to celebrate incremental successes in comprehension. Additionally, the Compare and Contrast Film and Text: *The Lightning Thief* note-catcher ▲ provides sentence frames and partially completed answers, which both serve as models of expected responses and slightly reduce students’ workload.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.B.5, 6.I.B.8, and 6.II.C.6.

Assessment Guidance

- Students may need some explanation on the experience of making a film to understand the choices the director made that led to the differences between the film and the novel.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will plan the introduction of their compare and contrast essay with a strong focus statement.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.6.4 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 2, Lesson 7**. Students will also need a **dictionary**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

- Remind students they have seen this learning target before; it is the essay prompt they are going to be working on in the next half of the unit.

- Turn and Talk:

“What do you think you will be doing in this lesson based on these learning targets?” (reading the next chapter of *The Lightning Thief* and then watching a scene from the film to compare it to the novel)

“Why are we doing this? How is it meaningful to you? How will it help you to be successful?” (This will give us practice in viewing the same ideas from various perspectives and thinking critically about why people approach the same content in different ways.)

Work Time

A. Read *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 16 Excerpt – RL.6.1 (20 minutes)

- Repeated Routine: Read aloud the selected excerpt, using **Text Guide: *The Lightning Thief*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Refer to the following resources as appropriate to support this section of the lesson: **Gist Record: *The Lightning Thief*** **anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**, **vocabulary logs**, **chapter synopsis**, and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Excerpt: starting at page 257 “We must have taken a wrong turn . . . ” and ending at the end of the chapter on page 265 “One day to complete our quest.”

- Gist: Percy learns the full story of Thalia’s death while traveling in a truck with abused animals. The trio ends up trapped in the Lotus Casino in Las Vegas, where time moves slowly. They lose five days of their trip there.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

B. Compare and Contrast Text and Film Scene – RL.6.7 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can compare and contrast what I see and hear when I read the text to what I perceive when I watch the same scene of the film.”

- Remind students that when we read, we often get an idea in our minds of what characters look like or how they are supposed to act. We imagine scenes and settings. Directors, actors, and even the screenwriter make decisions about how a novel or even a play with a script will be portrayed on screen, including changing things dramatically on occasion. After identifying what is the same and different, students will evaluate the impact of those similarities and differences on the reader/viewer. Remind them that to *evaluate* means to judge.

- Distribute the **Model Compare and Contrast: Film and Text, *The Lightning Thief*** **note-catcher** or **Compare and Contrast: Film and Text, *The Lightning Thief*** **note-catcher** ▲.

- Point out that the writer used this organizer to help to gather evidence to support her thinking, which helps the reader trust the writer. People who read these essays want evidence so they can better understand the points being made.

- Emphasize that the essays they write, like the model, will be grounded in evidence so people will better understand them.

- Invite students to sit with their triads before viewing the film. Tell students they will view the scene from chapter 16, when Percy, Grover, and Annabeth enter the Lotus Casino (pages 242—265, and the Casino scene is on pages 257—265).

- Distribute and display **Compare and Contrast: Film and Text: *The Lightning Thief*** **note-catcher**.

- Show the clip of the **film, *Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief*** **(Scenes 18–19, 1:10:16–1:20:07)**. As students watch, encourage them to record what they notice about what they see and hear.

- After watching, have students jot down their answers in the first two columns. Invite them to Turn and Talk with their triads as they work.

- See the **Compare and Contrast Film and Text: *The Lightning Thief*** **note-catcher (example for teacher reference)**.

For Lighter Support

- After viewing the film scene during Work Time B, invite ELLs who need lighter support to briefly summarize the scene for the class. This will provide additional language practice to students with higher language abilities, as well as offer additional support to the ELLs in the class who need heavier support.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time B, give struggling students the option of beginning the Compare and Contrast Film and Text: *The Lightning Thief* note-catcher as homework and using class time in this lesson to reread relevant passages of the text, ask clarifying questions, and/or reflect upon or sketch their thoughts instead of write.

Closing and Assessment

A. Reflect on Habits of Character (5 minutes)

- Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**. Explain that it says at the top that effective learners are people who develop the mindsets and skills for success in college, career, and life.

- Read aloud the habit of character recorded:

“I take responsibility. This means I take ownership of my work, my actions, and my space.”

- Invite students to Turn and Talk to a partner. Then cold call students to share:

“What does responsibility look like? What might you see when someone is being responsible?” (See Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart \[example for teacher reference\].)

“What does responsibility sound like? What might you hear when someone is being responsible?” (See Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart \[example for teacher reference\].)

- As students share, record their responses in the appropriate column on the Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart.

- Invite students to give examples of showing responsibility at school, home, or other environments of importance to them.

- Record *responsibility* on the **academic word wall**. Invite students to add translations of the words in their home languages in a different color next to the target vocabulary. ▲

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their independent reading journal.
