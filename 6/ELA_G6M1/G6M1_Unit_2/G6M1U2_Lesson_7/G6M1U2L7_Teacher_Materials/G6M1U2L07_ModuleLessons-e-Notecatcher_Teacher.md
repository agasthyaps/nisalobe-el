<td><strong>Character: In the film version, Grover is filled with confidence. He is the center of attention as he performs onstage, singing and dancing with swagger. In the book, he is awkward and self-conscious. He is described as “scrawny,” “with acne and the start of a wispy beard on his chin” and “an easy target.”</strong></td>
<td><strong>The change in Grover’s characterization makes him less relatable to readers who are also self-conscious; one of the author’s main objectives had been making the characters relatable even though they possess powers.</strong></td>
