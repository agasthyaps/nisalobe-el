<td>Setting: Warehouse filled with life-sized statues. Page 173, “The warehouse was filled with more statues—people in all different poses, wearing all different outfits and with different expressions on their faces.”</td>

<td>Character: In the book, “Aunty Em,” Medusa, at first seems like a nice old lady, whereas in the movie, Medusa isn’t old, and she is mean to them immediately. Percy says on page 176, “Poor old lady. Who would want to hurt somebody so nice.”</td>
<td>The way Medusa is introduced in the book builds more suspense.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td></td>
<td>Plot and character: In the movie, there is a new character—we don’t know who she is, but she is the one who alerts Annabeth to Medusa.</td>
<td>Introducing this character who isn’t present in the novel builds the suspense, as when she taps Annabeth on the shoulder, the viewer thinks it’s going to be someone bad. The frantic panic and anxiety this character portrays extends the suspense because now the viewer knows there definitely is someone bad out to get them.</td>

<tr class="even">
<td></td>
<td>Plot: In the book, when Percy, Grover, and Annabeth arrive at the place, they are greeted by “Auntie Em,” who seems like a nice old lady and feeds them. In the movie, children think the place is empty and split up to look for a pearl.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Plot: Grover’s Uncle Ferdinand is a statue in both the book and movie. This is one of the ways the characters are alerted in both the book and the movie to Medusa.</td>

<td>Plot: Percy kills Medusa at the end of the scene by chopping off her head.</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td></td>
<td>Plot: Rather than Grover and his flying shoes helping rescue Percy from Medusa, Annabeth drives a truck through the warehouse to push her down, giving Percy the chance to cut off her head with his sword. The person who sets up Percy to be the hero of the scene in the book and the movie are different.</td>
<td>Adds additional action. Grover’s flying shoes might not have looked so effective in a movie. Truck makes movie feel more current and relevant to students now. Emphasizing strong women to make the movie more appealing to females.</td>
