Language Dive Guide: Compare and Contrast Model Essay Focus Statement

W.6.2a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

**A comparison of chapter 11 of the book and the same scene of the movie** reveals both similarities and differences. (focus statement from Unit 2 Compare and Contrast Model Essay)

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps to address the daily learning target and W.6.2a by facilitating a deep investigation of a focus statement of an essay introduction.

- Supporting Standards: SL.6.1.

- Guiding Question: The sentence helps respond to a big idea of the module (**Examining multiple points of view supports a more complex understanding of our own and others’ choices and beliefs**) by inviting students to consider the point of view of the writer and movie director.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it features a complex noun phrase, which is typical of academic writing. Invite students to discuss each chunk briefly, but encourage extended conversation and practice with the focus structure: **A comparison of chapter 11 of the book and the same scene of the movie.**

- Practice and Transfer: After discussing the focus structure, students practice using it to discuss something in their lives. Students transfer their understanding of the meaning and structure of this sentence when contrasting *The Lightning Thief* text with the film and during the End of Unit 1 Assessment.

- Delivery: Note that the chunks are presented in reverse order to provide context for the reason presented in the final chunk, allowing for better understanding and discussion. Additionally, only 10 minutes are allocated for this Language Dive. Be mindful of pacing so that the majority of the time is spent discussing and practicing the focus structure.

**Time**

10 minutes

Throughout the Language Dive

Encourage rich conversation among students about the meaning of each of the sentence chunk strips, what the academic phrases within each chunk mean, and how they relate to the sentence and the text overall. Monitor and guide conversation with total participation techniques and Conversation Cues.

After asking questions, provide students up to 1 minute of think time to reflect, depending on the complexity of the question. Alternatively, invite partners to discuss, providing an allocated time for each student.

Record and display student responses next to or underneath the target language for visual reference.

Although students should briefly discuss all chunks in each Language Dive sentence, invite them to slow down during one chunk, called the focus structure, to investigate and practice a particularly compelling language structure.

Where possible, place sketches, pictures, or illustrations above key nouns and verbs in the chunks after discussing their meanings. This allows students to quickly access the content of each chunk as they work with the structures in the sentence as a whole.

For translation work, invite students to use their online or paper translation dictionary if necessary. Invite students to add new vocabulary to their vocabulary logs.

Note: Some responses to questions in the Language Dive indicate only that “Responses will vary.” Like one the larger goals of Language Dives, “Responses will vary” is intended to suggest that students should be encouraged to grapple with questions and ideas, develop interest and participation, and not be immediately steered toward “correct” responses. Indeed, even where correct responses are provided, consider continuing to invite a culture of inquiry and grappling.

**Key**

Red

Launch

- Welcome students to their third Grade 6 Language Dive. Display the term **Language Dive.**

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partner. Say:

“Based on your first and second Language Dives, what do you think a Language Dive is?” (Responses will vary.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

- If productive, cue students to clarify the conversation by confirming what they mean. If necessary, prompt students’ responses with sentence frames: “Yes, you’ve got it” or “No, sorry, that’s not what I mean. What I mean is \_\_\_\_\_.” Say:

“So, do you mean \_\_\_\_\_?” (Responses will vary.)

- Confirm or amend and display students’ ideas.

Deconstruct

- Remind students about the first step in the Deconstruct stage:

“When we do a Language Dive, first we read the sentence. We talk about what we think it means and how it might help us understand our guiding question.”

- Invite students to put their finger by this sentence from the Compare and Contrast Model Essay on their note-catchers: **A comparison of chapter 11 of the book and the same scene of the movie reveals both similarities and differences.**

- Read aloud the sentence twice, and then ask students to take turns reading the sentence aloud with their partners.

- Say:

“What does this sentence mean to you?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“How does this sentence add to your understanding of the big idea that examining multiple points of view supports a more complex understanding of our own and others’ choices and beliefs?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

both similarities and differences.

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following sentence chunk strip: **both similarities and differences.**

- Say:

“Does this chunk come at the beginning or the end of the sentence? How do you know?” (At the end; it ends with a period.)

“What are similarities? Does anyone know what this word means?” (things that are the same)

“What about differences? Does anyone know what differences are?” (things that are different)

- Encourage students to write definitions of these words onto their note-catchers in their own words. 🖉

“Think about what we’ve been doing in class. What do you think this sentence is talking about: the differences and similarities between what two things?” (Responses may vary, but encourage students to make connections to the compare-and-contrast work they are doing with The Lightning Thief text and movie scene)

- Say:

“Let’s talk about the second chunk.”

reveals

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **reveals**

- Say:

“Does anyone know what the verb reveals means?” (to make something known)

- Make sure students move forward with a clear and accurate understanding of this word. Encourage dictionary use and home language translations, if needed. Encourage students to write definitions of this word onto their note-catchers in their own words. 🖉

- Say:

“What do we do to reveal similarities and differences between things?” (We compare and contrast them.)

- Say:

“Let’s talk about the third and final chunk.”

A comparison of chapter 11 of the book and the same scene of the movie

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **A comparison of chapter 11 of the book and the same scene of the movie**

- Underline comparison in red, and invite students to do the same on their  
  note-catcher. 🖉

- Say:

“Does anyone know what comparison means?” (the act of analyzing two or more things to see what is the same and what is different)

- If students do not know what the word means, encourage them to think about similar-sounding words (e.g., **compare**) and affixes (e.g., **-ison**) to help them make guesses.

- Say:

“What two things did the writer of this sentence compare?” (chapter 11 of The Lightning Thief book and the same scene of The Lightning Thief movie)

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Tell students they will now practice the focus structure:

“You’ve played with this chunk and figured out the meaning. Now let’s use the structure in the sentence for our own speaking and writing.”

- Display the sentence frame: **A comparison of \_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_ reveals that \_\_\_\_\_\_.**

- Tell students they will have time to think and discuss with their partners.

- Say:

“Use this frame to talk about some similarities and differences between common things in your own words with your triad.”

- Tell students you will give them 30 seconds to think and discuss with their partners, or write down their ideas on their note-catchers. 🖉 If students struggle to think of things to compare, encourage them to look around the classroom and compare objects that they find.

- After 30 seconds, invite student responses.

- If productive, cue students to expand their answers:

“Can you say more about that?” (Responses will vary.)

A comparison of chapter 11 of the book and the same scene of the movie reveals both similarities and differences.

Reconstruct

- Say:

“You did well figuring out what all of the chunks mean, and why they’re important.”

- Remind students they will now go from the Deconstruct to the Reconstruct stage:

“Now that you’ve played with the chunks, let’s put them all back together again into a sentence. And let’s see how playing with the chunks adds to our understanding of the meaning of the sentence and our big idea. Let’s see how reconstructing helps us understand how English works.”

- Point to and read the entire sentence on display: **<u>A comparison of chapter 11 of the book and the same scene of the movie</u> reveals both similarities and differences<u>.</u>**

- Tell students that this sentence is the focus statement of the introduction in the Compare and Contrast Model Essay. Remind them that focus statements tell the reader some of the main points of the essay.

- Say:

“What other questions can we ask that will help us understand this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“Now what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the big idea that examining multiple points of view supports a more complex understanding of our own and others’ choices and beliefs?” (Responses will vary. If students are stuck on this question, encourage them to think about how this focus structure frame can be used to introduce an essay that compares movies and books. because The Lightning Thief text and movie were made by different people, student essays might reflect on the different perspectives and choices of the director and author.)

- Say:

“What if we wanted to add more information to this sentence? What could we do?” (Responses will vary.)

“Let’s say we wanted to add some examples of similarities and differences. What words or phrases could we use to introduce the examples?” (for example; including; for instance)

Practice

- Say:

“You did well putting the chunks back together again and talking about how this Language Dive has added your understanding of the meaning of the sentence and the big idea.”

- Remind students they will now go from the Reconstruct to the Practice stage:

“You’ve played with the sentence and figured out the meaning, and why it’s important to the guiding question. Now let’s start to use the language in the sentence for our own speaking and writing.”

- Display the sentence frame: **A comparison of \_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_ reveals both similarities and differences; for example, \_\_\_\_\_.**

- Draw students’ attention to the semicolon (;) at the end of the frame. Remind them that semicolons can be used to separate two complete sentences that are very connected. 🖉

- Say:

“Use this frame to write on your note-catchers about the similarities and differences between the scene from the chapter 16 text and the same scene in the movie.” 

- Tell students that they should use **Compare and Contrast Film and Text**, which they filled out in Lesson 7, to help them.

- Tell students you will give them 1 minute to think, write, and/or discuss their answers with their partners.

- If productive, cue students to clarify their sentences by confirming what they mean: “So, do you mean \_\_\_\_\_?” (Responses will vary. Ensure that students are using the structure meaningfully.)

- After inviting responses, write and display student ideas.

- Congratulate students on completing the Language Dive to better understand the meaning of this sentence.
