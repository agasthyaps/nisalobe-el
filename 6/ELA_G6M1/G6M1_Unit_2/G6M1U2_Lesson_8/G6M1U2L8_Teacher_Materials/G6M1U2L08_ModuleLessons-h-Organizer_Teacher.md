**Focus Question:** How does the experience of reading chapter 16 of *The Lightning Thief* compare to watching the same scene in the movie? Consider what you see and hear when you read the text and watch/listen to the movie.

Focus

What is the main idea of your piece?

Explain the differences and similarities of the experience reading this scene in the book and watching this scene in the film.

Introduction

How will you catch the reader’s attention?

Ask a question of the reader: what if it were up to you to prevent a war between the three most powerful Greek gods?

What context do you need to give to your reader?

Briefly summarize the general plot of the story:

• Percy is a relatively normal twelve-year-old boy.

• He is the son of the Greek God Poseidon.

• Accused of stealing Zeus’s lightning bolt

• Go on a quest to find it and return it to Zeus

• Challenges and difficulty but are able to persevere

Write your focus statement:

A comparison of the end of chapter 16 of the book and the same scene of the movie reveals both similarities and differences.

What are the main points you will be making to support this focus?

Similarities and their impact in viewer/reader.

Differences and their impact in viewer/reader.

Proof Paragraph(s) for Point 1

What is the first point that supports your focus statement?

Similarities:

• Setting

• Escape

**Evidence**

What evidence from the text(s) supports this point?

Setting:

• Book – “entrance was a huge neon flower, the petals lighting up and blinking. No one was going in or out, but the glittering chrome doors were open, spilling out air-conditioning that smelled like flowers—lotus blossom . . .” (257).

• Film – in the movie, we see the trio outside a bright, wild, loud, and enticing building with everything one might want, from food to fun.

Escape:

• In both, Percy is the one who realizes what is happening. He works to break the spell he and his friends have been under.

How does this evidence support this point?

In a movie that is, overall, very different from the novel, keeping much of this scene the same makes the movie instantly recognizable to anyone who has read the book.

Proof Paragraph(s) for Point 2

What is the next point that supports your focus statement?

Differences:

• Grover’s character

• Annabeth’s character

**Evidence**

What evidence from the text(s) supports this point?

Grover:

• Book – is awkward and self-conscious, “scrawny,” “with acne and the start of a wispy beard on his chin” and “an easy target”

• Film – confident, center of attention, singing and dancing Annabeth:

• Film – only just interested in gambling, snacking, and dancing

• Book – captivated by “brainiac stuff,” like watching *National Geographic*, playing trivia games, and building a holographic city

How does this evidence support this point?

The change in Grover’s character makes him less relatable to readers.

One of Annabeth’s main strengths is her intelligence. Film ignores this.

The film reduces the complexities of these two characters. It is harder to see the qualities that define their characters and solidify the trio’s friendship.

Conclusion

Restate your focus statement from the introduction.

A comparison of the end of chapter 16 of the book and the same scene of the movie reveals both similarities and differences.

What are your further reflections on this topic?

• Both revolve around same setting at the Lotus Casino.

• The characters depicted are very different.

• The outcome of the scene is the same.

• In both, they figure out what’s happening and leave the hotel.

• Biggest similarity is the feeling of strength and power both readers and viewers experience.
