Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.6.2 – Work Time B: Students participate in a Language Dive that guides them through the meaning of a sentence from the Compare and Contrast Model Essay. The focus of this Language Dive is on understanding the author’s focus statement and to help students understand how to use comparing and contrasting language effectively. Students then apply their understanding of the meaning and structure of this sentence when writing focus statements for their informative essays in upcoming lessons and when revising their essays to include linking language.

- RL.6.1 – Work Time C: Students use evidence from the text to plan the introduction for their Compare and Contrast essay. Provide differentiated mentors by purposefully preselecting student partnerships so that these students can work together for this activity and throughout the planning of their essays. Students conclude the lesson in Closing and Assessment A by sharing with peers their introduction plan, which serves to help them rehearse their plan and identify any problems with it.

- RL.6.7 – Work Time C: As they plan the introduction of their essays, students compare and contrast the experience of reading a scene in a story with the experience of watching the same scene in a film.

- W.6.4 – Work Time C: Using the Model Compare and Contrast Essay and Language Dive as guidance, students organize a clear and coherent introduction with attention to task, purpose, and audience.

- W.6.5 – Work Time C: Students receive some support as they strengthen their writing by thoughtfully planning the introduction of their essay.

- W.6.9a – Work Time C: Students apply Grade 6 Reading standards to literature by comparing and contrasting a video clip and its corresponding scene in the text.

- In this lesson, students work to become effective learners, focusing on a characteristic of their choice as they draft their introductions.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Use “brag tags” to identify students in class who are particularly good at different aspects of writing an introduction, and allow them to conference with their classmates to give advice on their area of expertise.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lessons, students analyzed the structure of the model essay using the Painted Essay® template. In this lesson, the introduction is analyzed in detail so students can begin planning their own essays. Students also began comparing and contrasting the film and novel in the previous lessons, which is work that they will build on in this lesson.

Support All Students

- Students may need additional support planning their introductions. Group those students for a guided discussion to give context to the reader about the novel and film. ▲

- Note that adolescence is characterized by extreme self-consciousness. Some students may feel uncomfortable sharing their writing with a peer and accepting constructive criticism. Consider sharing and feedback options that allow for anonymity. Additionally, find areas to praise every student and bolster confidence.

- To support ELLs, this lesson provides students with additional time to complete an exercise that was begun in Lesson 7, incorporating a Language Dive that deconstructs the focus statement of the Compare and Contrast Model Essay, and strengthening writing development through the planning of the introductions of students’ own essays. Additionally, an Informative Writing checklist helps make explicit the expectations of students’ writing and allows opportunities for them to track progress and self-assess.

- ELLs may find it challenging to see the focus statement of the Compare and Contrast Model Essay as a model that can be manipulated in their own writing. Point out during the Language Dive that this focus statement is simple and clear, and emphasize during the Practice section that there are many ways to make it more specific or academic in their own essays (e.g., by adding a semicolon and the phrase *for example*).

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.B.6, 6.I.C.10, 6.II.B.4, 6.II.B.5, and 6.II.C.1.

Assessment Guidance

- Monitor as students plan their focus statement and introduction paragraph. It is critical that their focus statement is precise and meets the requirements of the assignment; otherwise, it will affect the content of the rest of their essay.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will plan the first Proof Paragraph of their essays. They will plan their essay one paragraph at a time over the next three lessons before producing and then revising a draft for their End of Unit 2 Assessment in Lessons 12 and 13.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RL.6.7 (5 minutes)

- Record the following on the board for students as they arrive:

- Retrieve and review your **Compare and Contrast Film and Text: *The Lightning Thief*** **note-catcher**. Put a star next to one of your observations about a similarity or difference, and be ready to share it with the whole group during our discussion later in the lesson.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

- With students, use the vocabulary strategies on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart** to deconstruct the word *introduction* (the paragraph that opens a piece of writing and helps the reader understand what the writing will be about). Record on the **domain-specific word wall** with translations in home languages, where appropriate, ▲ and invite students to record in their **vocabulary logs**.

- Using a total participation technique, invite responses from the group:

“What is an introduction? What is the purpose of it?”

- With student support, record the meaning of *introduction* (the beginning or opening to an essay or book) on the domain-specific word wall with translations in students’ home languages. Write synonyms, or sketch a visual above each key term to scaffold students’ understanding.

- Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**, and invite them to read the habits of character on the chart to themselves. Tell students to choose a habit to focus on as they begin drafting today.

Work Time

A. Compare and Contrast Text and Film Scene – RL.6.7 (5 minutes)

- Ask students to retrieve their Compare and Contrast Film and Text: *The Lightning Thief* note-catchers and their copies of ***The Lightning Thief***.

- Inform students that they will continue the work done in the previous lesson, finding the similarities and differences between how chapter 16 is presented in the book and the film.

- Cold call students to share the detail they starred at the beginning of the lesson. On the displayed note-catcher, model adding these notes to the “similarities” and the “differences” columns, and invite students to do the same on their own note-catchers. Refer to **Compare and Contrast Film and Text: *The Lightning Thief*** **note-catcher (example for teacher reference)**.

Work Time

B. Language Dive: Compare and Contrast Model Essay Focus Statement – W.6.2a (10 minutes)

- Tell students they will now participate in a 10-minute Language Dive to examine how focus statements can be organized to show contrast.

- Reread aloud the first paragraph of the **Compare and Contrast Model Essay**.

- Focus students on the sentence:

“A comparison of chapter 11 of the book and the same scene of the movie reveals both similarities and differences.” (paragraph 1)

- Use the **Language Dive Guide: Compare and Contrast Model Essay Focus Statement** and **red colored pencil** to guide students through a Language Dive conversation about the sentence. Distribute and display the **Language Dive: Compare and Contrast Model Essay Focus Statement note-catcher** and the **Language Dive: Compare and Contrast Model Essay Focus Statement sentence chunk strips**.

- See the **Language Dive: Compare and Contrast Model Essay Focus Statement note-catcher (example for teacher reference)**.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time B, ask students how Language Dives can help us generate discussion and learn language. To make pedagogical strategies transparent and empower students to take leadership of their learning, invite them to respond to questions such as, “How does this help us learn language?”, “How did you figure out what that word meant?”, and “What was useful for you in the discussion?”

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time B, incorporate brief practice connecting subjects to their verbs. In the Language Dive sentence, the word *reveals* is written in the third-person singular, connecting to the word *comparison*, which appears much earlier in the sentence. Encourage reflection on the complexity of the noun phrase (*A comparison of chapter 11 of the book and the same scene of the movie*) and how it can still be considered singular, even if it seems to be talking about more than one thing (e.g., *a book scene and a movie scene*).

Work Time

C. Plan an Introduction – W.6.2a (20 minutes)

- Inform students that they will use the notes they generated on the Compare and Contrast Film and Text: *The Lightning Thief* note-catcher as they begin planning their own essays in response to the prompt: *How does the experience of reading chapter 16 in The Lightning Thief compare to watching the same scene in the film?*

- Explain that in this lesson, they are only planning the introductions in their graphic organizer and will actually draft the essays for Part II during their end of unit assessment in Lessons 12–13.

- Ask students to retrieve their annotated copies of the Compare and Contrast Model Essay, and remind them that this essay was written to the same prompt to which they will write their essays, but the model essay referenced events from chapter 11 instead.

- Invite students to refer to their **Painted Essay® Template** to remember the parts of an introduction:

- Context (information to engage the reader and provide needed background)

- Focus statement

- Invite students to choral read the introduction of the model essay together as a class, stopping after each sentence to explain its function in the paragraph. ▲ Invite students to help record the parts of an introduction on the **Criteria for an Effective Informative Essay anchor chart**. Refer to **Criteria for an Effective Informative Essay anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Focus the class on the following sentences from the model essay:

“Can you imagine learning that your father is a Greek god? What about fighting immortals to find Zeus’s lightning bolt? This is what happens to Percy Jackson in *The Lightning Thief* by Rick Riordan. In the book and the movie, Percy is a 12-year-old boy who learns that he is the son of the Sea God, Poseidon. Then Percy and two friends go on a quest to find Zeus’s bolt. A comparison of chapter 11 of the book and the same scene of the movie reveals both similarities and differences.”

- Turn and Talk:

“What would be the effect if these sentences were removed from the paragraph?” (The reader wouldn’t understand what novel was being discussed or what the novel was about in general.)

- Ask:

“What is the best way to summarize the sentences that come before the focus statement in the model essay’s introduction?” (They catch our interest and give us some context for the novel and film.)

- Direct students’ attention to the prompt and focus statement for the essay:

- Prompt: How does the experience of reading chapter 16 in *The Lightning Thief* compare to watching the same scene in the film?

- Focus Statement: A comparison of chapter 11 of the book and the same scene of the movie reveals both similarities and differences.

- Ask for a volunteer to describe how the prompt and focus statement are related. (The focus statement answers the questions in the prompt.) Refer frequently to the Language Dive students have just completed. Encourage students to think about the meaning of the focus statement as they connect it to the prompt. ▲

- Distribute and display the **Informative Writing checklist**. Invite students to read the checklist to themselves.

- Using a total participant technique, invite responses from the group:

“What do you notice about this checklist? What do you wonder?” (Responses will vary.)

- Give students a few minutes to reread the Compare and Contrast Model Essay. Then, use a total participation technique to invite responses from the group:

“What criterion on this checklist do you see done well in the model? What evidence from the model supports your thinking?” (Responses will vary.)

- If productive, ask students to listen carefully and seek to understand, and then to explain why a classmate came up with a particular response:

“Who can tell us what your classmate said in your own words?” (Responses will vary.)

“Who can explain why your classmate came up with that response? I’ll give you time to think and write.” (Responses will vary.)

- As students share out the criterion, jot down, say aloud, sketch, and display each characteristic to provide visual reinforcement. ▲

- Point out the following characteristic on the checklist:

- W.6.2a: I have an introduction that gives readers the context they need to understand the topic or text.

- Ask:

“Are there any specific characteristics of this piece that you should be aware of and list in that column on the checklist?” (Responses will vary.)

- As students share out, capture their responses in the Characteristics of This Informative Essay column as needed. Refer to the **Informative Writing checklist (example for teacher reference)** for guidance. Remind students to refer to the **academic word wall** and domain-specific word wall as needed.

- Display and invite students to retrieve their **Informative/Explanatory Writing Plan graphic organizer**. Refer to **Informative/Explanatory Writing Plan graphic organizer (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Invite students to use the Compare and Contrast Model Essay, the criteria on the Criteria for an Effective Informative Essay anchor chart, and the Informative Writing checklist to plan an introduction on the writing plan graphic organizer. Explain that students will be planning their essays over the next few lessons and will write the piece as part of the assessment at the end of this unit. Today they will plan only the introduction.

- Circulate to support students as they plan their introductions. Provide students an opportunity to verbally test and rehearse their ideas with a partner before recording their ideas. This may allow them additional time to organize their thinking.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Closing and Assessment

A. Reflect on Habits of Character (5 minutes)

- Move students into groups of three or four, and have them reread the Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character they chose to focus on in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Plan Introduction

- Students review and revise their focus statements and plan for their introduction to make sure they are responding to the prompt. Remind students that, at this time, they are only planning and not drafting their introduction.

B. Preread Anchor Text

- Students should preread chapter 17 in *The Lightning Thief* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.
