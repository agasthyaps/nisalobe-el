Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Work Time A: Students complete the End of Unit 3 Assessment. Throughout Unit 3, students planned a scene of *The Lightning Thief* told from the point of view of a new character, who is a friend of Percy Jackson and the child of one of the Greek gods or another figure from a traditional story. In this lesson, students use those plans to compose the final drafts of their narratives. (W.6.3, W.6.4, W.6.6, W.6.10)

- W.6.3 – Closing and Assessment A: Students reflect on their learning using the Track Progress: Narrative Writing recording form. This exercise is meant to provide them with time to formally keep track of and reflect on their own learning. This self-reflection supports metacognition and pride in work and learning.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Some students may not require the level of scaffolding provided in this unit. Prompt students toward deeper levels of understanding and increased rigor by referencing Levels 3 and 4 of Webb’s Depth of Knowledge.

- Guide students in an informal discussion of when the skills of rewriting a text or writing narrative texts might be important in a “real-world” setting. Prompt students with suggestions like writing the script for a commercial, a blog post for a celebrity, or a movie treatment.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the second half of this unit, students have been reimagining a scene from *The Lightning Thief* and rewriting it to incorporate a new character. Students have completed research on a different Greek god or goddess and developing a character who is the child of that god. Using their research and a checklist of narrative writing characteristics, students have been planning their original narrative scene. This lesson continues those routines in an assessment.

Support All Students

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment.

- For some students, this assessment may require more than the 25 minutes allotted. Provide time over multiple days if necessary.

- Support ELLs in the end of unit assessment by reminding them of the related tasks they have already successfully completed. Make sure that Mid-Unit Assessment instructions are expressed very clearly; ask students to paraphrase the instructions as a way to gauge understanding, and/or provide ELLs with simpler or varied input. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson invites students to complete an assessment task that builds upon the independent preparation they completed in Lessons 6–8. Note that the Agenda calls for returning Mid-Unit 3 Assessments to students with feedback at the beginning of class. Depending on students’ assessment performance and general attitude, wait until the end of class to distribute graded assessments, so students are not overly anxious as they begin the end of unit assessment.

- ELLs may find the End of Unit 3 Assessment challenging. Encourage students to consult classroom resources, especially the note-catchers on which they’ve planned their narratives, and give them specific, positive feedback on the progress they’ve made learning English.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.C.10, 6.I.C.12, 6.II.B.3, and 6.II.B.4.

Assessment Guidance

- All assessment materials (student prompt and teacher checklist) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback on this assessment, use the answer key and sample student responses (see Assessment Overview and Resources) to help complete the student Track Progress form.

- In this assessment, students are tracking progress toward the following anchor standard:

- W.3: Write narratives to develop real or imagined experiences or events using effective technique, well-chosen details, and well-structured event sequences.

Down the Road

- In the final three lessons of this module, students create a multimedia presentation explaining their narrative choices: choice of Greek god (or a character from another traditional story), new character choices, choice of scene from *The Lightning Thief* to revise, and how and why they revised that scene. Students will present to a live audience, including reading aloud their revised scene.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Review the student tasks and example answers to understand what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Ensure Mid-Unit 3 Assessments with feedback are available for each student at tables.

- Prepare the End of Unit 3 Assessment: Write a Narrative (see Assessment Overview and Resources). Review the Narrative Writing Rubric: Grade 6 (see Module 1 Teacher Guide: Appendix and/or Tools Page, https://eled.org/tools).

- If students are composing their narratives on computers, ensure devices are powered up and in proper working order before students arrive.

- Prepare copies of handouts for students, including entrance ticket (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Opening A: Use an online screen and voice recording tool, such as http://eled.org/0133, to capture feedback for students on their End of Unit 2 Assessment. Students may better comprehend the critiques provided if they are explained orally.

- Work Time A: Students compose narrative in a word-processing document—for example, a Google Doc—using speech-to-text facilities activated on devices or using an app or software such as http://eled.org/0103.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Return Mid-Unit 3 Assessments (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 9**. Students will also need **Mid-Unit 3 Assessment with feedback**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

- Remind students that they saw a similar learning target in the previous lesson and that they’ve been planning their narratives. Today they will compose the narrative they have been planning.

Work Time

A. End of Unit 3 Assessment: Write a Narrative (25 minutes)

- Distribute **devices** with word-processing capabilities or **lined paper** on which students will compose their essay.

- Invite students to retrieve the following materials:

- **Model Narrative: “Greek God: Hypnos”**

- **Narrative Writing Plan graphic organizer**

- **Narrative Writing checklist**

- **Model Narrative Comparison with Text**

- ***The Lightning Thief***

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence.

- Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**; review perseverance and what this looks and sounds like. Remind students that as they will be writing their narratives independently for the assessment, they may need to practice perseverance.

- Display and distribute **End of Unit 2 Assessment: Write a Narrative**.

- Read aloud the directions as students follow along, reading silently. Make sure that ELLs understand the assessment directions. Answer their questions, refraining from supplying answers to the assessment questions themselves. ▲

- Invite students to begin the assessment.

- While students are taking the assessment, circulate to monitor and document their test-taking skills.

- After the assessment, ask students to discuss what was easiest and what was most difficult about writing their narratives. In future lessons and for homework, focus on the language skills that will help students address these challenges. ▲

For Lighter Support

- Before Work Time A, underline important vocabulary in the end of unit assessment directions. Prompt and encourage students to do the same. Read the instructions aloud as a class to ensure that students understand the expectations of the assessment.
