End of Unit 3 Assessment: Write a Narrative

**Name:** **Date:**

Throughout this unit, you have been planning how to seamlessly insert a new character, the child of another Greek god with a unique gift or power, into an existing scene of *The Lightning Thief* without changing the outcome of the scene.

In this assessment, you will write the narrative you have been planning.

REMEMBER: A well-written narrative:

- Introduces the characters and setting.

- Organizes events in a logical sequence.

- Slows down the pace during the most important events and speeds it up between important events.

- Uses dialogue and description to slow down the pace.

- Uses transitional words and phrases to move time along and speed up the pace.

- Uses precise words and phrases and sensory language to convey experiences and events.

- Follows rules of writing (spelling, punctuation, and grammar).

Now, begin work on your narrative. Manage your time carefully so you can complete the following:

1.  Draft your narrative.

2.  Use the Narrative Writing checklist to revise and edit your essay.
