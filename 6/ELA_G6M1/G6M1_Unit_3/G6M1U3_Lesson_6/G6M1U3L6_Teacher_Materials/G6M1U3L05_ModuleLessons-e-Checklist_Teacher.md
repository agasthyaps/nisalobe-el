|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| W.6.9    | I effectively use information from sources to craft the characters, setting, or events in the narrative.                             | **I use information from my research about my Greek god/goddess to help me create my character, and I use the novel to provide the setting and main events of the narrative.** |                |
| W.6.3a   | Events in the narrative are clear and connected.                                                                                     | **I follow the main events of my chosen scene as they appear in the novel and integrate the new character into the scene in ways that make sense and are clear for a reader.** |                |
| W.6.3a   | I use details and description to engage the reader and to introduce the reader to the narrator, and/or characters.                   | **I use description and language to introduce my character and his/her parent into the scene from the novel.**                                                                 |                |
| W.6.3e   | The narrative has a satisfying or thought-provoking conclusion.                                                                      | **I make sure my narrative doesn’t change the main events of the novel or the conclusion of my chosen scene.**                                                                 |                |
| W.6.3a   | I organize events in a sequence that unfolds naturally and logically.                                                                | **I integrate my new character into the action of the scene in ways that make sense to a reader and the events of that scene.**                                                |                |
| W.6.3c   | I use a variety of transitional words and phrases to sequence events, and to show changes in time or in setting.                     |                                                                                                                                                                                |                |
| W.6.3b   | I develop experiences, events, and characters using dialogue and description.                                                        | **I use dialogue and description to integrate my new character and the other characters into the scene.**                                                                      |                |
| W.6.3b   | I “slow down” important events by adding detail and “speed up” events that are not important.                                        | **I alter the text of the novel to make the integration of my new character feel natural, which may mean cutting parts or adding more detail about new parts I add.**          |                |
| W.6.3d   | I help the reader imagine experiences or events by including descriptive details and sensory language, and choosing words precisely. |                                                                                                                                                                                |                |
| W.6.4    | I use a narrative voice that is appropriate to my purpose and engages the reader.                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                |                |
| L.6.1    | My words and sentences follow the rules of writing.                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                |                |
