Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 6

W.6.3

(For Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Reread the model narrative, and choose one sentence that you think is effective and demonstrates one of the criteria on the Narrative Writing checklist.

Explain what makes the sentence effective and how it demonstrates one of the criteria. Be ready to share with the whole group.

Answers will vary. Sample student response: “Its foamy tongue was lolling over its teeth, its paws moving as if he were happily chasing demigods in his dream.” The sentence demonstrates the writing criterion: “I develop experiences, events, and characters using dialogue and description.” The sentence is effective because it provides a humorous description of the sleeping Chimera, which sets up the possibility of escape for the characters on the observation deck.
