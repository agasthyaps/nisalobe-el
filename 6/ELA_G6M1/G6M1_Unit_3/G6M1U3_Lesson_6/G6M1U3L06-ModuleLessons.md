Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.6.3 – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they reread the model narrative, select a sentence that they find effective, and connect it to criteria on the Narrative Writing checklist.

- RL.6.1 – Work Time A: Students read the next chapter of the text and find the gist. Students also unpack unfamiliar vocabulary and answer comprehension questions using inferences and evidence from text.

- W.6.3 – Work Time B: Students plan their character and scene insertion. They incorporate their research on the character’s god parent and the physical description and traits of the character. Students also begin thinking through which scene will work best for inserting this character and justifying their choice, considering which relevant descriptive details to include and how to structure the event sequences. Students may not complete all of their planning in this lesson and will continue their work in the next two lessons.

- W.6.4 – Work Time B: Using the model narrative as guidance, students plan a clear and coherent narrative, with attention to task, purpose, and audience.

- W.6.5 – Closing and Assessment A: Students share their initial character and scene plans with a partner. Remind students that any feedback they provide should be kind, specific, and helpful. Additionally, stress that the first draft of a plan is rarely the best draft; tell students that their ideas will evolve and improve over time.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Introduce a new vocabulary word— *penultimate*. Explain that penultimate means second to last. In today’s lesson, students will be reading from the penultimate, or second to last, chapter in *The Lightning Thief*. Encourage students to come up with other scenarios in which they could use this word.

- Make the Pair Share in Closing and Assessment A more interactive by incorporating a movement protocol.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students began their work toward the End of Unit 3 Assessment by establishing expectations for this assignment. They read a model narrative and analyzed it to determine how it compared and contrasted with the original scene from the novel. Students also began establishing the characteristics of narrative writing using a checklist that they applied to the model narrative. They will apply this same checklist to their own narrative writing as they work toward the end of unit assessment.

Support All Students

- Students may be surprised, offended, confused, or upset by the depiction of Gabe’s verbal abusiveness toward Percy and his mother and the suggestion of a history of physical abuse toward Percy’s mother in this chapter. Time for debriefing and reflection might help get these concerns out into the open so they can be addressed and tracked throughout the text.

- Successfully developing a new character and planning the scene revision depends first on students’ understanding of the scene and the Greek god they have selected. Make sure to provide opportunities for students and/or groups to ask questions throughout Work Time B, frequently referring back to their research from Lesson 3 or extending their research as the character evolves. ▲

- Some students may not be able to spontaneously come up with ideas for their original character and scene insertion. A number of digital, interactive online tools can be leveraged, such as character name generators or storyboarding sites, to inspire ideas and help students gain momentum with their writing.

- Provide choice in how students plan using their graphic organizer. Allow students to write full sentences, jot down, or sketch their ideas. Model all the available choices, and empower students to make the decision that works best for their planning style. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson allocates preparation time for students to further develop their new characters for the narrative writing task of the end of unit assessment. Note that time is devoted in Lessons 6, 7, and 8 to students’ character and scene insertion planning. Because the tasks and/or focus of these lessons are similar, their suggested supports for ELLs are also similar. Based on student performance in Lessons 6 and 7, release students from some of the supports applied in those lessons to foster independence and to assess student progress.

- ELLs may find it challenging to complete page 1 of the Narrative Writing Plan graphic organizer in the allotted time. Allow students flexibility in their approach to the organizer. Accept bulleted responses, sketches, and other representations of ideas. Work with students over time to translate these ideas into more fully developed, coherent responses.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.B.6, 6.II.A.1, 6.II.A.2, 6.II.B.3, 6.II.B.4, and 6.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- Circulate and monitor as students complete the Narrative Writing Plan graphic organizer. Set up writing conferences to ensure that students understand the requirements of the assignment and to push students’ thinking.

- Students will likely not finish all of their planning during this lesson. They will have time in the next two lessons to continue planning.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students read from the final chapter in the anchor text, *The Lightning Thief*. They will continue to plan their narratives, using their analysis of the model narrative to determine where to insert their new character. Students will strategically edit the original scene, determining what to keep and what to change.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Strategically group students in triads with at least one strong reader per group for work during Work Time A as they read from the next chapter in the novel.

- Review the Narrative Writing checklist.

- Review the student tasks and example answers to understand what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Preread chapter 21 in *The Lightning Thief* to identify words or plot points that may challenge students.

- Prepare copies of handouts for students, including entrance ticket (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time B: Use an online storyboarding tool, such as http://eled.org/0135, to help students organize their ideas around their original character.

- Work Time B: Students complete their Narrative Writing Plan graphic organizer in a word-processing document such as a Google Doc.

- Closing and Assessment A: Allow students to use an online avatar tool, such as http://eled.org/0156, to develop their characters. Students can build the character based on the physical attributes they have created and then write a short script for the avatar to speak. Avatars could be used to introduce students’ initial character plans to their partners.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.6.3 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 6**. Students will also need the **Model Narrative: “Greek God: Hypnos”** and the **Narrative Writing checklist**.

- Once all students have arrived, discuss student answers to the question and remind them they will return to the model and the checklist often as they plan and then write their own narratives.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

- With students, use the vocabulary strategies on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart** to deconstruct the term *character profile* (description of a character’s appearance and personality). Record on the **domain-specific word wall** with translations in home languages, where appropriate, ▲ and invite students to record words in their **vocabulary logs**.

- Turn and Talk:

“What do you think you will be doing in this lesson based on these learning targets?” (We will start to create our new character and determine what scene would be good to use for our narratives.)

- Tell students that before they begin planning their narratives, they will read from another chapter of the novel.

Work Time

A. Read *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 21 Excerpt – RL.6.1 (20 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Read aloud the selected excerpt, using **Text Guide: *The Lightning Thief*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Refer to the following resources as appropriate to support this section of the lesson: **Gist Record: *The Lightning Thief*** **anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**, vocabulary logs, **chapter synopsis**, and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Excerpt: Read from page 340 (“The gods weren’t moving . . . ”) to page 346 (“ . . . some kind of hero”).

- Gist: Percy goes to Mount Olympus, returns the bolt, and meets his dad. Percy reunites with his mom, offers to help her with Gabe, and returns to Camp Half-Blood.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

B. Plan Character – W.6.3 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can create a character profile for my new character.”

“I can choose an appropriate action scene for my character to join in *The Lightning Thief*.”

- Display and distribute the **Narrative Writing Plan graphic organizer**.

- Read the prompt aloud.

- Using a total participation technique, invite responses from the group:

“What is this assignment asking you to do?” (Create a new character and rewrite a scene from *The Lightning Thief* that includes that new character and that is told from that character’s point of view.)

- Invite students to retrieve their Narrative Writing checklist and the Model Narrative, and remind them that they have been analyzing this text as a model of effective narratives. Remind students that today they will start planning their own characters and will choose the scene from the novel, using the Narrative Writing Plan graphic organizer. They will continue to plan for the next two lessons and then write their narrative during Lesson 9.

- Select a volunteer to read the headings on page 1 of the organizer, clarifying as needed. If students need additional support in understanding the organizer, share the **Narrative Writing Plan graphic organizer (for teacher reference)** that goes with the Model Narrative.

- Direct students’ attention to the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**. Focus students on perseverance, and remind them to attend to this habit of character as they engage in this challenging work.

- Direct students to work individually to begin the character section on page 1 of the Narrative Writing Plan graphic organizer.

- Circulate and support students as they plan. Remind them to be creative but to remember that their narratives should be based on a scene from *The Lightning Thief*, and to refer to their research and the model narrative as they plan.

- If needed, model doing quick sketches within the graphic organizer as placeholders for information. Tell students that they can sketch first, so that they don’t forget the information they want to add. Then, they can go back later and write. ▲

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time B, provide students with the Narrative Writing Plan graphic organizer (example for teacher reference) to evaluate as an example. Invite students to add more information to the model as practice before beginning independent work. This support will better familiarize students with the expectations of the task, while at the same time requiring comprehension, critical thinking, and creativity as students consider what else to add to the model to improve it.

For Heavier Support

- Determining which scene to revise may be especially challenging for some students, especially ELLs, who may struggle to fully comprehend some details of the scene. If possible, compile a short list of two or three possible scenes with page numbers and brief synopses from which students can choose.

Closing and Assessment

A. Pair Share – W.6.5 (5 minutes)

- Direct students to share their Narrative Writing Plan graphic organizer with their partner.

- Remind students to check the Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart before they share.

- Students may exchange graphic organizers or present the characters and scene choice with their partner. Circulate to support pairs as they share. Reassure students that they might not have completed their planning right now, but they will have more time during the next lesson.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread chapter 22 of *The Lightning Thief* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.
