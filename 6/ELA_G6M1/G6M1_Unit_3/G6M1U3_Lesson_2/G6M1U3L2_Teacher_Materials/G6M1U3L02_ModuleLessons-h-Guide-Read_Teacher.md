Close Reading Guide: “Hestia”

RI.6.1, RI.6.2, RI.6.4, L.6.4

(For Teacher Reference)

**Purpose and Notes**

- Since students have already determined the central idea in the preceding Language Dive, the main purpose of this close read is for students to trace the way the author develops the central idea of the text.

- Note that students should return to the Practice portion of the Language Dive before writing the summary at the culmination of the close read.

- In this close read, students will focus only on selected sections of the text.

- Although there is a lot of challenging vocabulary in this text, this close read focuses only on words needed to understand how a central idea is conveyed. Support with definitions of additional words as needed for basic comprehension, and invite students to use the accompanying glossary as necessary.

- The vocabulary questions in this close read have been designed to reinforce the strategies introduced in previous lessons. Encourage students to make these connections and to use a wide range of strategies to understand key words and phrases.

- Continue to use discussion protocols (e.g., Think-Pair-Share, Conversation Cues, and total participation techniques) to engage all students in collaborative discussion about the text.
