Language Dive Guide: “Hestia,” Paragraph 1

RI.6.1, RI.6.2, RI.6.4, SL.6.1, L.6.4

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

She was the Greek goddess of Fire, specifically the domestic hearth, which was the area **on which people had fires in their homes.** (from paragraph 1 of “Hestia”)

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps to address the daily learning target and RI.6.2 by inviting students to determine the central idea(s) of a new informational text and RI.6.4 and L.6.4 by providing opportunities for students to identify the meanings of words as they are used in the text.

- Supporting Standards: RI.6.1, SL.6.1

- Guiding Question: The sentence helps students respond to the guiding question (**What is mythology?**) by introducing a new myth that contains elements common across myths.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses a relative pronoun (**which**) fronted by a preposition (**on**). Invite students to discuss each chunk briefly, but encourage extended conversation and practice with the focus structure: **on which people had fires in their homes.**

- Practice and Transfer: After discussing the focus structure, students practice using it to discuss something in their lives. Students transfer their understanding of the meaning and structure of this sentence when writing an academic summary during the Mid-Unit 1 Assessment.

- Delivery: Note that this Language Dive precedes a close read of the “Hestia” text. To best support students’ understanding of the text in preparation of their own summary writing, plan to complete all but the final Practice section of the Language Dive before guiding students through the close read. Then, after students complete the close read, return to the Practice section.

Deconstruct

- Invite students to put their finger by this sentence from “Hestia” on their note-catcher: **She was the Greek goddess of Fire, specifically the domestic hearth, which was the area <u>on which people had fires in their homes.</u>**

- Read aloud the sentence twice, and then ask students to take turns reading the sentence aloud with their partners.

- Say:

“What does this sentence mean to you?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

“How does this sentence add to your understanding of the guiding question?” (Responses may vary. Encourage and acknowledge all responses.)

Deconstruct (Unfamiliar Language)

- If necessary, support students in understanding some key, unfamiliar language before analyzing each chunk. Examples: **domestic**, **hearth**.

She was the Greek goddess of Fire, specifically the domestic hearth,

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following sentence chunk strip: **She was the Greek goddess of Fire, specifically the domestic hearth,**

- Underline **<u>she</u>**, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 

- Say:

“To whom does she refer in this sentence?” (Hestia)

“What do you think the Greek goddess of Fire looks like? What can she do? Take 30 seconds to sketch a picture on your note-catcher of Hestia, the Greek goddess of Fire.” 🖉

“What does this chunk tell us?” (Responses will vary, but may include: it tells us that Hestia is the goddess of fire in the home.)

which was the area

Deconstruct

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **which was the area**

- Underline **<u>which</u>**, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 

- Say:

“To what does which refer in this sentence? How do you know?” (the domestic hearth, because that is the noun phrase that comes just before this chunk)

“What does this chunk tell us?” (This chunk tells us more about the domestic hearth.)

“What do you think will come after this chunk?” (Answers will vary, but may include: more information about the domestic hearth or about the area being described here.)

on which people had fires in their homes.

Deconstruct (Focus Structure)

- Display and read aloud the following chunk: **on which people had fires in their homes.**

- Say:

“What does this chunk tell us?” (It completes the definition of domestic hearth; it tells us more about the “area” of the previous chunk.)

- Underline **<u>on which</u>**, and invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 

- Say:

“What do you notice about the underlined part of this chunk?” (Responses will vary.)

- Draw students’ attention to the alternative sentence on the note-catcher: **She was the Greek goddess of Fire, specifically the domestic hearth, which was the area which people had fires in their homes on.**

- Say:

“How is the underlined chunk in this new sentence different from the chunk we are looking at?” (The underlined chunk says “which \_\_\_\_\_ on”; the current chunk says “on which \_\_\_\_\_.”)

“Do you think these two chunks have the same meaning? How do you know?” (Yes, they have the same meaning.)

“If they mean the same thing, why do you think the author chose to say ‘on which’?” (Responses will vary, but may include: it sounds more formal; two which clauses in a row sounds strange; it is best to avoid ending sentences with prepositions or other small words)

Practice (Focus Structure)

- Say:

“Sometimes in sentences that have which and a preposition, writers move prepositions to the front of the word which. Writers might do this to make their sentences sound clearer or more academic. This structure works with other kinds of prepositions, too.”

- Display the sentence frames:

1.  **Here is the cover of *The Lightning Thief*, on which there is \_\_\_\_\_.**

2.  ***The Lightning Thief*** **is the book in which \_\_\_\_\_.**

3.  **There are many things I like about *The Lightning Thief*, one of which is \_\_\_\_\_.**

- Tell students to choose a sentence frame to complete aloud with a partner. After 1 minute, invite student responses.

She was the Greek goddess of Fire, specifically the domestic hearth, which was the area on which people had fires in their homes.

Reconstruct

- Point to and read the entire sentence on display: **She was the Greek goddess of Fire, specifically the domestic hearth, which was the area <u>on which people had fires in their homes.</u>**

- Underline She in blue and the remainder of the sentence in red. Invite students to do the same on their note-catcher. 🖉

- Say:

“What do you notice about the words underlined in blue and red?” (The words in blue show the subject, and the words in red show the predicate.)

“I wonder why the predicate is so long. Why did the writers add on to this predicate? How did they do it?” (The writers wanted to combine many ideas into one sentence. They used a series of clauses.)

“What if we remove this long predicate?” Experiment with removing the red chunks and rereading the sentence aloud: She. (It doesn’t make sense. The subject She isn’t doing anything. It needs the predicate.)

“What other questions can we ask that will help us understand this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“<u>Now</u> what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the guiding question, What is mythology?” (Responses will vary. If students are stuck, encourage them to think about how central mythological figures like Hestia are to mythology overall.)

- After inviting responses, write and display students’ ideas.

Break for Close Read

- Tell students that they will now participate in a close read of the Hestia text. Then, they will return to the Language Dive to complete the final Practice.

Practice

- Display the sentence frame:

**“Hestia” is an informational text in which we learn about \_\_\_\_\_.**

- Say:

“Use this frame to talk about the central idea of the Hestia text in your own words with your partners. You can also take notes on your note-catchers, if you wish.” 🖉

- Tell students you will give them time to think and discuss with their partners. After 1 minute, invite student responses.

- If productive, cue students to clarify their sentences by confirming what they mean:

“So, do you mean \_\_\_\_\_?” (Responses will vary. Ensure that students are using the structure meaningfully.)

- Congratulate students on completing the Language Dive to better understand the meaning of this sentence and how to use it in their own speaking and writing.
