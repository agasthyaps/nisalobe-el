Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RI.6.2 – Work Time A: Students participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from the informational text “Hestia.” This sentence, which presents the thesis of “Hestia,” provides students an opportunity to determine and analyze the central idea(s) of a text. Additionally, the Language Dive draws students’ attention to relative clauses fronted by a preposition (*of which* . . . ), which students can use in their own academic writing.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time B: Students participate in a close reading of “Hestia,” using textual evidence to support their analysis of the text’s ideas. The Close Reading Guide lists the text excerpts, key questions to ask students, and instructional moves required. Continue to use discussion protocols (e.g., Think-Pair-Share, Conversation Cues, and total participation techniques) to engage all students in a collaborative discussion about the text.

- RI.6.2 – Work Time B: During the close read, students consider the central idea(s) of “Hestia,” and the ways in which these ideas are conveyed through details.

- RI.6.1 – Work Time C: Students use evidence from “Hestia” to support their analysis of its central idea(s).

- RI.6.2 – Work Time C: As a culminating task of the close read, students produce a summary of “Hestia,” free from their own personal opinions and judgments.

- RI.6.2 – Closing and Assessment A: Students use the Criteria for an Effective Summary anchor chart to evaluate a summary written by a classmate during the class time. Be prepared to identify a student whose summary would make a strong model. Ensure that this student is comfortable sharing his or her work with the class, and cultivate a safe environment in which students can conduct this peer critique.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become ethical people and effective learners as they collaborate in triads throughout the lesson.

- This lesson is the first that includes built-out instruction for the use of Goal 2 Conversation Cues. Goal 2 Conversation Cues help students listen carefully to one another and seek to understand. To review the complete set of cues, refer to Overview–Conversation Cues on the Tools Page (http://eled.org/tools). Examples of the Goal 2 Conversation Cues used in the next two units include:

- To prompt students to repeat or paraphrase:

“Who can repeat what your classmate said?”

“Who can tell us what your classmate said in your own words?”

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Build on the compare and contrast work that students did in Unit 2 by providing a text that shares a common central idea with “Hestia.” Consider using the lyrics to a popular song to encourage engagement in the task.

- Continue to emphasize the connections between myths from varying cultures. ▲ Encourage students to gather information about other gods and goddesses of hearth and home, such as Kojin (Japan), Vesta (Rome), and Brigid (Ireland). Relate this new learning back to the Guiding Questions for the Module, especially “What is the purpose of myths?”

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students revisited the expectations for the performance task, for which they will now reimagine a scene from *The Lightning Thief*. The new scene will include an original character, the child of a Greek god or goddess that they will research. In this lesson, students gain more practice learning about a Greek figure as they read “Hestia” and summarize the key details as they will do during their independent research.

Support All Students

- Note there is a differentiated version of the Close Read: “Hestia” note-catcher used in Work Time A. ▲

- Students may need additional support with recording their answers on their note-catchers. Group those students for more support when necessary.

- To support ELLs, in this lesson students participate in a close read of an informational text about the Greek goddess Hestia. The close read simulates, in a scaffolded way, the kind of reading and summary writing that students will complete independently during the mid-unit assessment. Additionally, a key sentence from the close read is isolated for further review in a Language Dive that supports students’ abilities to identify and describe the central idea(s) of a new text.

- ELLs may find it challenging to understand the complex focus structure of the Language Dive (*on which people had fires in their homes*). Try to integrate additional opportunities for practice into later lessons. Also, make sure students are aware of the purpose of this structure, namely that it is generally considered a more formal alternative to sentences that end in prepositions.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.B.6 and 6.I.B.8.

Assessment Guidance

- Review students’ culminating task recording form to ensure students understand how to determine a central idea of the text and identify how it is conveyed in the text. Students will use this information to write a summary.

- After the lesson, review students’ Language Dive: “Hestia,” Paragraph 1 note-catcher from Work Time B to ensure students understand the central idea of the “Hestia” text. Also, check note-catchers for any linguistic errors that can be addressed in future feedback. ▲

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will conduct research to find out more about a Greek god (or figure from a traditional story) on which to base their new character.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 2**. Students will also need a copy of **Text: “Hestia.”**

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

- With students, use the vocabulary strategies on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart** to deconstruct the term *central idea* (the main point(s) the author wants the reader to know and take away from reading the text). Record on the **domain-specific word wall** with translations in home languages, where appropriate, ▲ and invite students to record words in their **vocabulary logs**.

- Turn and Talk:

“What do you think you will be doing in this lesson based on these learning targets?” (We will be reading a new text and determining a central idea. We will also write a summary without our opinions, something that we started to do in Unit 2.)

“Why are we doing this? How is it meaningful to you? How will it help you to be successful?” (These skills are important because they help us become better readers and thinkers, especially when we read new texts and are building our understanding of a topic, like Greek mythology.)

- Tell students they are going to participate in a Language Dive before they engage in a close read of the text.

Work Time

A. Language Dive: “Hestia,” Paragraph 1 – SL.6.1 (10 minutes)

- Before beginning the Language Dive, briefly read the entire text aloud as students follow along.

- Ask:

“What is the gist of this text? Refer back to your answer from Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 2.” (This text is about the Greek goddess Hestia, goddess of the hearth.)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can determine a central idea and how it is conveyed through details in ‘Hestia’.”

- Tell students they will now participate in a Language Dive to examine how a sentence can offer clues to the central idea of a text.

- Reread aloud the first paragraph of the “Hestia” text.

- Focus students on the sentence:

“She was the Greek goddess of Fire, specifically the domestic hearth, which was the area on which people had fire in their homes.” (from paragraph 1 of “Hestia”)

- Use the **Language Dive Guide: “Hestia,” Paragraph 1 (for teacher reference)** to guide students through a Language Dive conversation about the sentence. Distribute and display the **Language Dive: “Hestia,” Paragraph 1 note-catcher** and the **Language Dive: “Hestia,” Paragraph 1 sentence chunk strips**.

- Use Goal 2 Conversation Cues to help students listen carefully to one another:

“Who can repeat what your classmate said?”

Work Time

B. Close Read: “Hestia” – RI.6.2 (15 minutes)

- Focus students on the Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart. Remind them that digging deeper into the text can help them understand it better, so they are going to dig deeper into an informational text through close reading.

- Gather students who might need additional support during the close read in one place in the room to support them quickly and quietly as they closely read the text. ▲

- Direct students’ attention to the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**, and review what collaboration looks and sounds like.

- Distribute and display the text, “Hestia,” and the **Close Read: “Hestia” note-catcher** or **Close Read: “Hestia” note-catcher** ▲.

- Use **Close Reading Guide: “Hestia” (for teacher reference)** to set the purpose of the close read and to guide students through a close read of this text. Refer to the guide for how to integrate the following:

- Close Read “Hestia” note-catcher

- Refer to **Close Read: “Hestia” note-catcher (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

For Lighter Support

- For an extra challenge after the Language Dive of Work Time B, provide students with a short list of statements ending in prepositions, and ask students to rewrite them using a *which* relative clause that begins with a preposition.

For Heavier Support

- During the close read of Work Time B, provide short sentence frames from the sample student response that students can use in their summaries. This will support low-proficiency students, while still requiring them to generate much of their own syntax and content. These frames could include

- “‘Hestia’ begins by . . . ”

- “It continues to . . . ”

- “This conveys the central idea . . . ”

- “The text concludes by . . . ”

- During the Practice (Focus Structure) section of the Language Dive, offer questions to accompany the sentence frames that make it clearer what should go in the frames. These questions could include

- What is on the cover of *The Lightning Thief*?

- What happens in *The Lightning Thief*?

- What is one thing you like about *The Lightning Thief*?

Work Time

C. Determine Central Idea and Write Summary – RI.6.2 (10 minutes)

- Direct students to return to and complete the final practice of the Language Dive and then complete the culminating task of the Close Read.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Closing and Assessment

A. Whole Group Critique – RI.6.2 (5 minutes)

- Ask a student to volunteer, or choose a sample summary that students completed on the Close Read: “Hestia” note-catcher.

- Focus students’ attention on the **Criteria for an Effective Summary anchor chart**. Explain that they’re going to look at a sample and determine how well it meets the criteria for an effective summary.

- Display the summary, and ask a student to read it aloud.

- Remind students to check the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart** before they share.

- Use a total participation technique to invite responses from the group:

“What characteristics on this anchor chart do you see done well in the sample? What evidence from the sample supports your thinking?” (Responses will vary.)

“How is a summary of an informational text different from a summary of a literary text? How is it the same?” (One difference is that instead of discussing a theme that is conveyed as one would with a literary text, with an informational text, central idea is discussed. Otherwise the summaries are very much the same structure.)

- If productive, direct students to listen carefully and seek to understand, and then to explain why a classmate came up with a particular response:

“Who can tell us what your classmate said in your own words?” (Responses will vary.)

“Who can explain why your classmate came up with that response?” (Responses will vary.)

- As students share out the characteristics, jot down, say aloud, sketch, and display each characteristic to provide visual reinforcement. ▲

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their independent reading journal.
