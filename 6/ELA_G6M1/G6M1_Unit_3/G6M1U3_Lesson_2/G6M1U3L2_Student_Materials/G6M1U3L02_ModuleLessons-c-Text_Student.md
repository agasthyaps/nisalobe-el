**Hestia**

Hestia was the daughter of Cronus and Rhea. She was the Greek goddess of Fire, specifically the domestic hearth, which was the area on which people had fires in their homes.

Now in these early days the hearth was seen as the most important and most sacred part of the dwelling. In fact, the hearth was held so sacred it was always built in the center of every home. It was a few feet in height and was built of stone; the fire was placed on top of it. The members of the family would gather around this fire and the head of the house would take the place of honor nearest the hearth. Here prayers were said.

In Grecian cities there was a common hall, called the Prytaneum, in which the members of the government had their meals. In the common hall was the public hearth called the Hestia after the goddess Hestia. The Hestia fire was where the meals for the members of the government were prepared. The goddess Hestia is generally represented standing and she always appears fully draped. Her facial expression is serene but serious.
