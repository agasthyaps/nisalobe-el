Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- Work Time A: Students complete the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment. They read the text “Helios,” answer questions about vocabulary in the text, identify a central idea and key details, and write a summary of the text. (RI.6.1, RI.6.2, RI.6.4, RI.6.10, L.6.4a, L.6.4c, L.6.4d, L.6.6)

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- For the assessment, students read about Helios, the Greek god of the sun. Students may be curious to research solar deities in other cultures, such as Bast (Egypt) or Surya (Buddhism).

- Invite students to look up other words with the root word *helios* and make connections between the meanings of those words and the Helios myth.

- Use the assessment text to practice other Language standards, such as identifying the connotation of words in the text (L.6.5c).

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the first half of this unit, students read Greek myths and determined main ideas and key details from Greek myths. They synthesized these details into effective and unbiased summaries. This lesson continues those routines in an assessment.

Support All Students

- If students receive accommodations for assessments, communicate with the cooperating service providers regarding the practices of instruction in use during this study as well as the goals of the assessment.

- Some students may need the text read aloud before they work on the questions. Invite students who require this to sit in a group away from the rest of the students, so as not to be distracting.

- For some students, this assessment may require more than the 25 minutes allotted. Provide time over multiple days if necessary.

- To support ELLs, this lesson invites students to complete assessment tasks similar to the classroom tasks completed in Lessons 1–3. Note that the Agenda calls for returning End of Unit 2 Assessments to students with feedback at the beginning of class. Depending on students’ assessment performance and general attitude, wait until the end of class to distribute graded assessments so students are not overly anxious as they begin the mid-unit assessment.

- ELLs may find the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment challenging, as it is a big leap from heavily scaffolded classroom tasks. ELLs will be asked to independently apply cognitive, linguistic, and writing skills developed in Lessons 1–3. The assessment also requires that students read and determine the central idea of a new informational text about a Greek god (“Helios”), and then summarize the text. Validate students’ anxieties and concerns, but remind them of their hard work tackling similar tasks in previous lessons. Encourage students to do their best, and assure them that they will continue learning together after the assessment.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.B.6, 6.I.C.10, and 6.I.C.12.

Assessment Guidance

- Mid-Unit 3 Assessment: “Helios” (student and teacher versions) are included in the Assessment Overview and Resources.

- When assessing and providing feedback on this assessment, use the answer key and sample student responses (see Assessment Overview and Resources) to help complete students’ Track Progress recording form.

- In this assessment, students are tracking progress toward the following anchor standards:

- R.1: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.

- R.4: Interpret words and phrases as they are used in a text, including determining technical, connotative, and figurative meanings, and analyze how specific word choices shape meaning or tone.

- R.10: By the end of Grade 12, I will be able to: Read and comprehend complex literary and informational texts independently and proficiently.

- L.4: Determine or clarify the meaning of unknown and multiple-meaning words and phrases by using context clues, analyzing meaningful word parts, and consulting general and specialized reference materials, as appropriate.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will read chapter 20 of *The Lightning Thief*. They begin preparing for the end of unit assessment by analyzing a model narrative and how it differs from the original text.

- Be prepared to return students’ Mid-Unit 3 Assessments with feedback in Lesson 9.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Ensure End of Unit 2 Assessments with feedback are available for each student at tables.

- Prepare Mid-Unit 3 Assessment: Determine a Central Idea (see Assessment Overview and Resources).

- Review the student tasks and example answers to understand what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Prepare copies of handouts for students, including entrance ticket (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Opening A: Use an online screen and voice recording tool, such as http://eled.org/0133, to capture feedback for students on their End of Unit 2 Assessment. Students may better comprehend the critiques provided if they are explained orally.

- Work Time A: Students complete assessments in a word-processing document—for example, a Google Doc—using speech-to-text facilities activated on devices or using an app or software such as http://eled.org/0103.

- Closing and Assessment A: Use a free data storytelling tool, such as http://eled.org/0134, to track progress toward anchor standards.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Return End of Unit 2 Assessments (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 4**. Students will also need their **End of Unit 2 Assessments with feedback**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

- Remind students that they will be determining the *central idea* (the main points the author wants the reader to understand and take away from reading) and *summarizing* (to give a short explanation of something that has been read, viewed, or heard), a new text.

Work Time

A. Mid-Unit 3 Assessment: “Helios” (25 minutes)

- Distribute **Mid-Unit 3 Assessment: “Helios.”**

- Read aloud the assessment directions as students follow along, reading silently.

- It may be especially challenging for ELLs to understand the assessment directions. Answer any clarifying questions, but refrain from supplying answers to the assessment questions themselves. ▲

- Direct students’ attention to the following anchor charts:

- **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart**

- **Strategies to Answer Selected Response Questions anchor chart**

- Remind students to refer to these anchor charts as they read the assessment text and answer the assessment questions.

- Remind students that because this is an assessment, they should complete it independently in silence. Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**, and review what perseverance looks and sounds like. Remind students that because they will be reading and answering questions independently for the assessment, they may need to practice perseverance.

- Invite students to begin the assessment.

- While they are taking the assessment, circulate to monitor and document their test-taking skills.

- After the assessment, ask students to discuss which assessment task was easiest and which was most difficult, and why. In future lessons and for homework, focus on the language skills that will help ELLs address these assessment challenges. ▲

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- Display a “map” of the assessment to reference while explaining directions to the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment. This will reduce ambiguity and give students a clearer picture of what they can expect, so that they can better allocate their time and attentional resources. Provide students with colored pencils or highlighters so that they can mark up the “map” as needed. Examples:

- Read an informational text about Helios.

- Guess a word’s meaning using context.

- Select the correct meaning of a word from a dictionary.

- Guess a word’s meaning using related words.

- Identify the central idea of the text.

- Underline a sentence that shows the central idea.

- Write a summary of the informational text.

- In the mid-unit assessment, ELLs’ summary writing might contain a multitude of language errors. Focus only on one or two pervasive errors to avoid overwhelming the student. Prioritize attention to content-related and organizational/structural errors over sentence-level errors, unless these errors disrupt comprehension of the summary overall.

Closing and Assessment

A. Track Progress (15 minutes)

- Distribute **Track Progress folders**, **Track Progress: Read, Understand, and Explain a New Text**, and **sticky notes**.

- Guide students through completing the recording form.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time. Provide students with sentence frames that allow them to identify and celebrate specific successes of the Mid-Unit 3 Assessment. ▲

Homework

A. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread chapter 20 of *The Lightning Thief* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.
