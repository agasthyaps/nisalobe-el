**Directions:** Review the feedback on your End of Unit 2 Assessment.

Based on your work in the End of Unit 2 Assessment, what is one star (area of strength) you want to continue to show in today’s assessment? What is one step (area of growth) you want to work toward in today’s assessment?

If you would like support to understand the feedback, please write your name on the board for a one-on-one review.

Answers will vary. Sample student response: I did a good job of using text evidence.  
In today’s assessment, I will plan to check all of the possible options for the selected response questions before choosing too quickly.
