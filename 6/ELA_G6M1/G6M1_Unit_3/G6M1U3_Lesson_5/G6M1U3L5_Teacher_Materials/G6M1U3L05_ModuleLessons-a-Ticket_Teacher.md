Sample student responses:

- Annabeth and Grover get on the elevator to descend from the top of the St. Louis Gateway Arch, but Percy has to wait for the next elevator.

- Percy is left on the observation deck of the Arch with a family, the park ranger, and a fat lady with a Chihuahua.

- The Chihuahua begins to bark ferociously at Percy.

- The Chihuahua grows until its back rubs the roof of the observation deck.

- The Chihuahua transforms into the Chimera: a monster with the head of a lion, the body and hooves of a goat, and a serpent for a tail.

- The Chimera charges at Percy.

- Percy runs to the other side of the observation deck in an attempt to guide the Chimera away from the family.

- The Chimera shoots a column of fire at Percy, which creates a huge hole in the Arch.

- Percy swings Riptide at the Chimera’s neck, but the sword hits the dog collar.

- The serpent tail of the Chimera bites Percy’s leg.

- Percy tries to stab the Chimera with Riptide, but the Chimera knocks Percy off his feet and Riptide flies out of the hole and into the Mississippi River.

- Percy backs up into the hole in the Arch.

- Echidna taunts Percy and tells him that if he really is the son of Poseidon, then he would not fear water.

- Percy feels the poison coursing through his veins and knows that he is dying.

- Percy prays, “Father, help me,” jumps out of the Arch, and plummets toward the Mississippi River.
