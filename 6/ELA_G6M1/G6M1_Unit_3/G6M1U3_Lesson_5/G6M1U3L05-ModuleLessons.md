Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RL.6.3 – Opening A: To hone their attention to the way a story’s plot unfolds, students complete an entrance ticket in which they create a bulleted list of the events that take place in a passage of *The Lightning Thief*.

- RL.6.1 – Work Time A: Students read the next chapter of the text and find the gist. Students also unpack unfamiliar vocabulary and answer comprehension questions using inferences and evidence from text.

- RL.6.3 – Work Time B: Students analyze a model narrative in which a scene from *The Lightning Thief* has been rewritten to add a new character, one developed from research about a different Greek god. Students annotate the text, taking note of the way the story unfolds in the original scene and how this has changed or remained the same in the model narrative.

- W.6.3 – Work Time B: Students use the model narrative as a guide to write their own narratives for the end of unit assessment.

- W.6.4 – Work Time B: Students review the model narrative and use it as an example of clear and coherent writing, developed for a particular task, purpose, and audience.

- W.6.3 – Closing and Assessment A: Students analyze the Narrative Writing checklist. They compare the attributes of narrative writing to the model narrative, noticing how the model aligns with the criteria to further establish the expectations for the end of unit assessment.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become ethical people, showing empathy, respect, and compassion, as they reflect on their reading of the next chapter in the anchor text.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Students read the model narrative considering how the narrator, in this case Parker, the child of Hypnos, responds to challenges and what this reveals about her character. Students have answered these questions in previous lessons about Percy. Applying them to the model narrative allows students to consider the same questions with a new character in mind.

- Invite students to make their own narrative writing checklist before giving them the checklist handout. Ask them to compare their self-generated lists with the “official” one to see how many attributes they were able to identify independently.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students completed their Mid-Unit 3 Assessment, in which they read an informational text and determined its central idea, around which they wrote a summary. The second half of this unit builds on that work as students use what they have read about another Greek god or goddess to create an original character that they will insert into a scene from *The Lightning Thief*.

Support All Students

- Note there is a differentiated version of the Close Read: “Hestia” note-catcher used in Work Time B in the separate Teacher’s Guide for English Language Learners. ▲

- Students may be surprised, offended, confused, or upset by some of the events depicted in this chapter. Be aware of the following:

- Percy has been set up, framed, and betrayed to spark a war that would affect the entire world.

- Percy has abandoned his mother to Hades in an effort to stop the war.

- Percy engages in an intense battle with Ares that leads to a police standoff and resulting explosion.

- Time for debriefing and reflection might help get these concerns out into the open so they can be addressed and tracked throughout the text.

- Some students may require additional support reading for gist in pairs. Work with students who may need additional support in small groups. ▲

- For students who may be overwhelmed by too much print on a page: reduce anxiety and support sustained effort by offering a copy of the model narrative with one paragraph per page. ▲

- Comparing and contrasting the model narrative and the scene may be difficult for some students. Consider ways to support those students through strategic grouping, modeling, or by offering guiding questions on the model narrative. ▲

- To support ELLs, this lesson recycles similar versions of questions from earlier lessons to discuss criteria for a narrative. This repetition reinforces students’ learning and accelerates linguistic growth. Additionally, in this lesson, students are presented with a model narrative that they may use as a reference to support their own independent writing during the end of unit assessment. The continued use of Goal 1 Conversation Cues also supports students’ abilities to clarify and expand their ideas, which helps ELLs both as speakers and listeners.

- ELLs may find it challenging to locate parts of the model narrative that establish the narrator’s voice. Offer students simple tips for identifying narrator information (e.g., focusing on sentences that include many *I* statements or that mention the narrator’s god/goddess parent).

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.B.6, 6.I.C.10, and 6.II.C.6.

Assessment Guidance

- This lesson establishes many of the expectations for students’ End of Unit 3 Assessment. It is critical that their understanding of the attributes of narrative writing and the details of their own narrative are clear. The model narrative may seem a bit long but since students are using parts of the text already written by Riordan, it should still be within reach for sixth graders. Allow time to address the inevitable questions that will arise as students analyze the model. Emphasize that their own narrative should not change the outcome of the novel. In the coming lessons students will be planning their narrative; use these opportunities to check in with students individually and support them as needed so they will be prepared and ready for the End of Unit 3 Assessment in Lesson 9.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will begin planning their narratives, developing a character profile for their original character, a child of the Greek figure they researched in Lesson 3. They will also begin zeroing in on the scene in which they want to insert this character. Planning for the narrative will take place throughout Lessons 5–8.

- Students will present their Performance Tasks in Lesson 12 of this unit. If an outside audience is being invited to this celebration of learning, remember to invite guests long in advance and secure any necessary rooms and equipment.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Strategically group students in triads with at least one strong reader per group for work during Work Time A as they read the next excerpt from the novel.

- Read through the model narrative and prepare annotations to distinguish which parts are from the original text and which are newly written. Note sections that develop the new character with details and attributes that incorporate learning about the researched Greek god. It is likely that the narratives the students plan and eventually write will be shorter than the model they analyze, especially given the limited time scheduled for the actual writing in Lesson 9.

- Review the student tasks and example answers to understand what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Preread chapter 19 in *The Lightning Thief* to identify words or plot points that may challenge students.

- Prepare copies of handouts for students, including entrance ticket (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Opening A: Students reread the scene on the top of the St. Louis Arch in which Percy battles Echidna, the Mother of Monsters, and a chimera. Use a search engine to find visuals of each of these elements to bring the scene to life.

- Work Time A: Display the model narrative in an online format, such as a Google Doc, and use the Comments feature to add annotations about how the narrative is the same and different from the existing scene.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RL.6.3 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 5**.

- Once all students have arrived, discuss student answers to the question and explain that they’re reviewing this now since they will be working with that section later in this lesson.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

- With students, use the vocabulary strategies on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart** to deconstruct the word *narrative* (a story). Record on the **academic word wall** with translations in home languages, where appropriate, ▲ and invite students to record in their **vocabulary logs**.

- If productive, use a Goal 1 Conversation Cue to encourage students to expand their ideas about the word *narrative* by giving examples.

“Can you say more about that?”

“Can you give an example?”

- Turn and Talk:

“Why would we identify characteristics of an effective narrative?” (Since we are going to write our own narratives, we need to know how to write a quality narrative. By identifying characteristics, we will know what to include in our narrative.)

- Tell students that before they begin planning their narratives, they will look at a model of a narrative that reimagines the scene from pages 206–211 that they just reread and think about the characteristics of it, but first they’re going to read from another chapter of the novel.

Work Time

A. Read *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 20 Excerpt – RL.6.1 (20 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Read aloud the selected excerpt, using **Text Guide: *The Lightning Thief*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Refer to the following resources as appropriate to support this section of the lesson: **Gist Record: *The Lightning Thief*** **anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**, vocabulary logs, **chapter synopsis**, and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Excerpt: Start on page 321 (“It was a trick, I said . . . ”), and read up to page 332 (“ . . . smoke-filled sky, and disappeared”).

- Gist: Back in L.A., Ares admits that the shoes and backpack were enchanted. Percy was supposed to die to enrage Poseidon. Hades would be found with the bolt, angering Zeus. Percy fights Ares; the Furies watch and realize Percy really isn’t the thief. The trio heads back to Mount Olympus to determine the true thief and stop the war.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

B. Analyze a Model – W.6.3 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning target relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

“I can analyze a model to identify characteristics of an effective narrative.”

- Distribute the **Model Narrative: “Greek God: Hypnos”** or **Model Narrative: “Greek God: Hypnos”** ▲ to each student. Remind students that they will analyze this model to help them write their own narrative that reimagines a scene from *The Lightning Thief* from the perspective of a new demigod character that they create for the end of unit assessment. Students will read the model narrative to determine the gist of the story and to identify characteristics of an effective narrative.

- After reading the model narrative, use a total participation technique to invite responses from the group:

“What is the gist of this text? What is it mostly about?” (This narrative describes the moment at the top of the St. Louis Arch, but from the perspective of a new character.)

- Record the gist on the board. Direct students to record the gist in their notebooks.

- Using a total participation technique, invite responses from the group:

“Who is the narrator, and what special powers does she have?” (Parker, daughter of Hypnos; putting people to sleep)

“What do you notice about this new scene and the original scene?” (Some sections are taken word for word from the scene in the novel, and some sections are new. The novel scene is from Percy’s point of view, but this new scene is from Parker’s point of view.)

- Invite students to underline the parts of the model narrative that establish the narrator and to put a star next to paragraphs that borrow text from the novel.

- Remind students to check the Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart before they share. Using a total participation technique, invite responses from the group:

“Which parts of the text did you label to show it establishes the narrator? What details in the text make you think so?” (Responses will vary, but may include: “While my father, Hypnos, wasn’t a warrior like some of the others, I did inherit some skills from him that might help Percy if he got into trouble. Putting people to sleep can sometimes come in handy”; or “I had to pull myself together to protect Percy and the innocent tourists. Trying to be inconspicuous, I felt in my pocket for my drawstring bag of sleeping powder, a combination of dried jasmine, lavender, and valerian root, one of the few tips my father took the time to teach me.”)

“Which parts of the text did you label to show the text that comes from the novel? What details in the text make you think so?” (Responses will vary, but may include: There is borrowed text from the novel—sometimes a small piece and sometimes the whole paragraph—in every paragraph of the sample except for 3, 9, 13, 17, 18, and 19.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Lighter Support

N/A

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time B, provide students with a brief synopsis of the St. Louis Arch scene as it is written in the book (this scene begins on page 206). This can be in the form of a short paragraph, timeline, or list of key sentences. This information will reduce memory demands, easing the cognitive load for ELLs as they interpret the model narrative.

- During Work Time B, instead of asking students to identify similarities and differences in the language of *The Lightning Thief* and Model Narrative: “Greek God: Hypnos,” present students with a few preselected pairs of sentences from the two texts. Some sentence pairs should illustrate language borrowed from the text of the novel; other pairs should show difference. Encourage students to underline, color-code, or write questions about the sentence pairs. This scaffolded alternative lessens the amount of reading students are expected to do, while honing their attention to the most critical parts of the task.

Closing and Assessment

A. Debrief: Narrative Writing Checklist – W.6.3 (5 minutes)

- Distribute and display the **Narrative Writing checklist**. Invite students to read the checklist to themselves.

- Using a total participant technique, invite responses from the group:

“What do you notice about this checklist? What do you wonder?” (Responses will vary.)

- Then, use a total participation technique to invite responses from the group:

“What characteristics on this checklist do you see done well in the model? What evidence from the model supports your thinking?” (Responses will vary.)

- If productive, cue students to listen carefully and seek to understand, and then to explain why a classmate came up with a particular response:

“Who can tell us what your classmate said in your own words?” (Responses will vary.)

“Who can explain why your classmate came up with that response? I’ll give you time to think and write.” (Responses will vary.)

- As students share out the characteristics, jot down, say aloud, sketch, and display each characteristic to provide visual reinforcement. ▲ Reassure students that they might not understand everything on this checklist right now, but they will learn more about it as they plan and write their essays.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Preread Anchor Text

- Students preread chapter 21 of *The Lightning Thief* in preparation for studying an excerpt from the chapter in the next lesson.
