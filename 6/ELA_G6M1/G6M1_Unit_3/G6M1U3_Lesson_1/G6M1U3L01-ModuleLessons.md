Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- RL.6.4 – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they consider the word choice and figurative language used by the author in chapter 19 of *The Lightning Thief*.

- RL.6.1 – Work Time A: Students read the next chapter of the text and find the gist. Students also unpack unfamiliar vocabulary and answer comprehension questions using inferences and evidence from text.

- RI.6.10 – Closing and Assessment A: Students share about their independent research reading texts to hold them accountable for their reading homework. Consider using Independent Reading: Sample Plans (see the Tools page, http://eled.org/tools) if you do not have your own independent reading review routines.

- Directions for routines that are repeated from previous lessons have been pared down and noted with “Repeated routine.” For the detailed outline of how to facilitate this part of the lesson, please refer back to previous lessons.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to become ethical people, showing respect, empathy, and compassion as they discuss the novel, and integrity as they share their independent research reading.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- The novel contains a number of moments of foreshadowing. Define *foreshadowing*, and direct students back to examples of foreshadowing earlier in the text (e.g., Percy attacks Nancy Bobofit with water from the fountain in chapter 1, which hints that Percy will be related to the god of water).

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In Unit 2, students read several chapters in *The Lightning Thief*. They also analyzed the Greek myths highlighted in the novel and compared themes and topics in the Greek myths with those evident in *The Lightning Thief*. In the second half of the unit, students wrote a literary analysis essay comparing and contrasting the experience of watching parts of *The Lightning Thief* movie with reading about the same events in the novel.

- In this unit, students finish the novel, conduct research on a Greek god or goddess of their choosing, and rewrite a scene from the novel inserting an original character, the child of the god they researched.

Support All Students

- In this unit, students will research a Greek god or goddess in preparation for the end of unit assessment, in which they rewrite a scene of *The Lightning Thief*, inserting a new character of their own creation. To maintain the first person point of view, students will rewrite the scene as if they are their new character, a child of a Greek god or goddess of their choosing. Some students and their families may find this exercise in conflict with their religious views. Create a safe space for students to approach with their concerns, and be prepared with alternative ways for students to complete the assessment. Students may choose a different historic or traditional figure to research and on which to base their character (e.g., Superman, Jesus Christ of Nazareth, Oprah Winfrey, etc.). Guide students in their choice for an alternative figure by asking 1) Can you conduct substantial research on this person; and 2) What powers or special abilities would the character inherit from this person?

- Students may be surprised, offended, confused, or upset by some of the events in chapter 19, for example:

- Percy’s arrival in the underworld (may conflict with students’ religious beliefs, especially if mistakenly equated to hell);

- Discussion of death and depiction of the deceased;

- Mention of Hitler, terrorism, and suicide bombers.

- Time for debriefing and reflection might help get these concerns out into the open so they can be addressed and tracked throughout the text.

- To support ELLs, this lesson introduces students to the performance task presentation of Lesson 12, giving them a clear sense of the goals and outcomes of their learning. Additionally, students have the opportunity during this lesson to analyze a model slideshow using a list of criteria for an effective presentation, which reduces ambiguity about the expectations for their presentations and increases students’ ownership of classroom tasks.

- ELLs may find it challenging to generate criteria for an effective presentation. Remind students that the presentation is the culminating performance task of Unit 3 and that they will have many opportunities to strengthen their understanding of the task.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.B.6 and 6.I.C.9.

Assessment Guidance

- Monitor students’ comparisons between the model and the anchor chart. Use misconceptions as an opportunity to provide clarification.

- Students may be overwhelmed by the amount of work shown in the model presentation. Assure students that they will have plenty of time in class to work toward the final product, drafting and revising each step.

- Celebrate reading completed for the independent research reading share. Remind students that the purpose of research reading is to build their content knowledge, domain-specific vocabulary, and achievement on reading complex texts. Maintain positivity and excitement around the habit of recreational reading.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students move away from the novel to build background on another Greek figure, Hestia. They read an informational text and identify a central idea to include in a summary. They also engage in a Language Dive to further explore the concept of central idea.

- Students will present their performance tasks in Lesson 12 of this unit. If an outside audience is being invited to this celebration of learning, remember to invite guests long in advance and secure any necessary rooms and equipment.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – RL.6.4 (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 1**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

- Invite students to paraphrase the word *criteria* using familiar synonyms or simple definitions. ▲

- Turn and Talk:

“What is the purpose of having criteria for something?” (We use criteria to figure out if something is of quality.)

“Why would we create criteria for a presentation?” (Since we are going to create our own presentations, we need to know how to write a quality slideshow. By creating criteria, we will know what to include in our own presentations.)

- Remind students that during this unit, they complete the performance task, which is a presentation in which they’ll share their research and their narratives that they’ll work on during this unit. Explain that during this lesson, they’ll see an example of a slideshow and unpack the criteria for an effective presentation. Then in Lessons 2 and 3, they’ll work on research. Starting in Lesson 5, they’ll work on their narratives, in which they will use their research to create a new character and rewrite a scene from *The Lightning Thief* from that character’s point of view, and they will return to the presentation creation in Lesson 10.

- Tell students that before they begin analyzing a model presentation for its effectiveness, they’ll first read another chapter of the novel.

Work Time

A. Read *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 19 Excerpt – RL.6.1 (20 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Read aloud the selected excerpt, using **Text Guide: *The Lightning Thief*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Refer to the following resources as appropriate to support this section of the lesson: **Gist Record: *The Lightning Thief*** **anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**, **vocabulary logs**, **chapter synopsis**, and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Excerpt: Start on page 310 (“I fought the feeling and stepped forward . . . ”) to the end of the chapter of page 319.

- Gist: Grover’s magic shoes start to fly him down the entrance to Tartarus; he barely escapes. The trio meets Hades. The master bolt mysteriously ends up in Percy’s backpack. Hades offers to trade Percy’s mother for the helm of darkness. Percy uses the three magic pearls to escape Hades with his friends, leaving his mother behind.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

B. Analyze Performance Task Model – SL.6.5 (10 minutes)

- Distribute the **Performance Task anchor chart** handout. Focus students on the displayed Performance Task anchor chart. Remind students what the Performance Task asks of them since it has been a while since they first discussed it at the start of Unit 1.

- Distribute and display the **Model Performance Task Slideshow printout**.

- Instruct students to work with a partner to examine a printout of the Model Performance Task Slideshow for the criteria listed on the Performance Task anchor chart. Model how to annotate the printout for the characteristics listed on the Performance Task anchor chart. Let students know they should be prepared to share these observations after the presentation.

- Use a total participation technique to invite responses from the group:

“What characteristics on the anchor chart do you see done well in the model? What evidence from the model supports your thinking?” (Responses will vary.)

- Ask:

“Based on what you see in the model, what kind of information will you need to research in order to be able to create a presentation like this?” (We need to choose and research another Greek god, we need to understand their origins and parents as well as their powers or special attributes and any important parts of their stories. We need to also keep track of where we get that information.)

- Record student responses on the board as they share answers, and direct students to copy the list from the board on their Model Performance Task Slideshow printout. Remind them they will use this to help them as they begin their research in Lesson 3.

- Explain that looking at these sample slideshow slides and notes right now will help them as they begin their research into another Greek god for their character development, which will begin in the next lessons. Later, they’ll examine a model narrative scene and a modeled delivery of the presentation to further prepare for the performance task.

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time B, incorporate additional graphics and visuals into the Performance Task Model in order to reduce the cognitive load for ELLs who may not be familiar with some of the phrases and imagery in the model (e.g., *carries a poppy stem and a branch dripping in water; has wings sprouting from around his eyebrows; modern sporty clothing*).

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time B, ELLs may struggle to interpret the text on the Performance Task Model, which is bulleted and often drops the subject (e.g., *likes to sleep \[a lot\]; carries dried plants*). Provide students with an additional handout that includes the presentation language alongside complete sentences (e.g., *Parker Riley likes to sleep \[a lot\]; Parker Riley carries dried plants*). This will illustrate the repetitiveness of including subjects and better acquaint students with the structural norms of presentation language. Students should also be encouraged to annotate this handout with additional notices or wonderings.

Closing and Assessment

A. Share Independent Research Reading – RI.6.10 (10 minutes)

- Refer to the **Independent Reading: Sample Plans** to guide students through a research reading share, or use your own routine.

- Remind students that the purpose of research reading is to build their content knowledge, domain-specific vocabulary, and achievement on reading complex texts. As necessary, use the Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart to review *integrity*.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their independent reading journal.
