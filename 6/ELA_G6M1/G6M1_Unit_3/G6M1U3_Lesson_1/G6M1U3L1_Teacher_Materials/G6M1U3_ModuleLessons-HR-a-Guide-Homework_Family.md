![](media/image1.png) Guiding Questions and Big Ideas

What is mythology, and what is the value of studying mythology from other cultures?

- *A collection of stories featuring traditional figures that explain natural phenomena and convey the values of the culture*

- *Studying stories from other cultures introduces alternative perspectives and amplifies one’s worldview.*

Why have stories from Greek mythology remained popular?

- *They teach themes that are still relevant.*

- *They contain figures whose attributes are valued across time.*

- *They ask questions about the human condition.*

- *They remain relatable because they can be reimagined to fit different environments and time periods.*

How does point of view change with experience?

- *A narrator’s or character’s understanding of an experience changes depending on one’s point of view.*

- *Examining multiple points of view supports a more complex understanding of our own and others’ choices and beliefs.*

What will your student be doing at school?

In Unit 3, students reimagine a scene from *The Lightning Thief*, writing themselves into the action as a different demigod from Camp Half-Blood. They research a Greek god of their choosing and use their research to create a new character, the child of that figure. Students develop the attributes of that character and strategically insert the character into a scene from the novel, editing carefully so as not to change the outcome of the story.

At the end of the module, students create a presentation outlining their choices and the reasons for their choices for the performance task.

The Language standard focused on in this unit requires students to vary sentence patterns for meaning and maintain consistency in style and tone.

Working to contribute to a better world is the habit of character emphasized in this unit. Specifically, students will focus on using their strengths to help others grow by providing kind, helpful, and specific feedback as they revise their narratives with their peers.

How can you support your student at home?

Discuss the attributes of favorite characters from books, movies, television, etc. Talk about what factors likely led the characters to develop those attributes. Especially focus on the influence of the character’s parents, caregivers, and mentors.

Read the news together. Discuss what you read, and look for allusions to mythology and other traditional stories.

Challenge your student to think critically about what he or she is reading. Ask about whose perspective is included, whose is excluded, how certain groups of people are being conveyed. Similar conversations could happen around other media like the news or advertisements.

Explore your local library for fractured fairytales rewritten for a young adult audience. Discuss how changing the perspective of the narrator reveals new ideas in a familiar story. Many options are available, including *Cinder* by Marissa Meyer, *Briar Rose* by Jane Yolen, or any of the *You Choose: Fractured Fairy Tales* series.

Seek out podcasts that highlight the pervasive power of mythology and/or the skill of storytelling. Podcasts appeal particularly to students whose strength is in auditory processing or those who appreciate the convenience of learning while on the go.

Ask your student to practice presenting their performance task for you. As students will not be formally assessed on this task, focus mainly on positive, encouraging feedback.

Help your student to make authentic connections between what they are learning in school and how it can apply in one’s personal and professional life. In this unit, students compose a narrative text and present their work to an audience. Look for examples of these skills being applied in the “real world.”

Read chapter books with your student, and discuss how each chapter fits into the overall structure of the novel using the key below:

**Key**

- **exposition:** beginning of the story describing how things are before the action begins

- **rising action:** series of conflicts and crises in the story that build toward the climax

- **climax:** the turning point, when something important happens that changes the direction of the story

- **falling action:** the action that happens after the climax and starts to guide the story toward the resolution

- **resolution:** the end of the story tying everything together

Unit 3: Homework

In Lessons 1–11, homework focuses on research reading.

**Research reading:** Your student is expected to independently research the topic by reading topic-related books of his or her choice for approximately 20 minutes each day and responding to a prompt of choice in the front of the independent reading journal. These are usually books your student will bring home from school; however, they may be topic-related books chosen by the student at the public or home library. Prompts for independent reading can be found in the homework materials provided.

**Choice reading:** If your student would also like to independently read and respond to a book of free choice, he or she may use the <u>back</u> of the independent reading journal. Prompts for independent reading can be found in the homework materials provided.

Vocabulary Logs

Students record new vocabulary in vocabulary logs and mark academic vocabulary with a symbol, for example, a star:

- **Academic vocabulary:** words you might find in informational texts on many different topics. For example, the words *evidence* and *rationale* are words that could be found in books on any topic.

- **Domain-specific vocabulary:** words about a particular topic. For example, the words *tadpoles,* *frogspawn*, and *amphibian* are some that would be found on the topic of frogs.

Independent Reading

**Directions:** Remember to record responses to research reading in the front of your independent reading journal and responses to choice reading in the back. Try to choose a different prompt each time.

Record any new vocabulary in your vocabulary log. Underline vocabulary found during independent reading.

Record:

- Date

- Title and author of your reading book

- Pages you have read

- Prompt

- Response

Example:

<u>Date:</u> 10/13/2020

<u>Book Title and Author:</u> *The Lightning Thief* by Rick Riordan

<u>Pages Read:</u> 242–257

<u>Prompt:</u> How does (character) change his or her point of view over the course of the plot?

<u>Response:</u> In the beginning of *The Lightning Thief*, Annabeth believed that she should be at odds with Percy because of the history of conflict between their parents. Annabeth is the daughter of Athena, goddess of, among other things, wisdom and warfare, while Percy is the son of Poseidon, the god of the sea and horses. Annabeth explains in chapter 10 that their parents have a long-standing rivalry; according to Greek mythology, they fought over who would be the patron of the city of Athens (Athena won). Over the course of the novel, Annabeth changes her point of view about Percy. She realizes that their parents’ issues are not their own. They learn to trust each other, work together, and become friends. In chapter 16 she even says, “I don’t know what my mom will do. I just know I’ll fight next to you . . . Because you’re my friend, Seaweed Brain” (251).

Consider using the following independent reading prompts.[^1]

- How does this text add to your understanding of one of the guiding questions of the module?

- How does (character) show characteristics of a hero?

- How does (character) change his or her point of view over the course of the plot?

- What strategy does (character) use to achieve success?

- How does (character) grow and change?

- If you were (character), what would you do differently?

- If the text contains a myth, what is the purpose of the myth?

- Which habits of character are demonstrated in the text? Explain.

- Record two or three facts in your own words that you learned from the text.

- Summarize your research reading today in no more than five sentences.

- What theme is present in the text you read? Provide text details that convey the theme.

- What questions do you have about the topic after reading?

- Choose one new word from your reading today, and analyze it on a vocabulary square:

|                                               |                                        |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Definition in your own words                  | Synonyms (words with the same meaning) |
| Words with the same affix or root             | Sketch                                 |
| Translation in home language (if appropriate) |                                        |

Vocabulary

**Directions:** In the classroom, you have been recording words from your texts in your vocabulary log. Throughout this unit, you have been research reading topic-related books at home to build your knowledge of mythology and recording words in your independent reading journal.

Choose a word from your research reading or from a text you’ve read in class, and add the word to your vocabulary log. Try to choose a different word to add and to practice a different vocabulary strategy each time. For each word, be sure to add the following:

1.  The definition, or meaning, of the word

<!-- -->

2.  The vocabulary strategy you used to figure out the meaning of the word

3.  A sketch or diagram that helps you to better understand the meaning of the word

Vocabulary Strategies

As a reminder, the vocabulary strategies we’ve been working on in class are:

- Context: read the sentence around the word.

- Look at the affixes for clues.

- Look at the root of the word for clues.

- Use a dictionary.

- Discuss the word with another person (after attempting some of the above strategies).

[^1]: Some of the prompts will not be appropriate for the text students are reading. Invite students to choose a prompt that works for the text they have just read.
