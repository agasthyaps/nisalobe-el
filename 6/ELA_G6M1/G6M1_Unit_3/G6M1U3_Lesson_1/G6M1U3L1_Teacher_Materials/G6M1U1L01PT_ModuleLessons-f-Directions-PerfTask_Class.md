(Example for Teacher Reference)

Throughout Unit 3, you wrote and revised a scene of *The Lightning Thief* told from the point of view of a new character—the child of one of the Greek gods or another figure from a traditional story—who is a friend of Percy Jackson. Now you are going to create a multimedia presentation explaining your narrative choices: choice of Greek god (or a character from another traditional story), new character choices, choice of scene from *The Lightning Thief* to revise, and how and why you revised that scene. You will present to a live audience.

Key Criteria for Success

Your multimedia presentation will include

- a description of your new character,

- a description of the Greek god or traditional figure who is the parent of the new character,

- a description of the scene you have chosen from *The Lightning Thief*,

- an explanation of why you chose that scene,

- reading aloud your revised scene, and

- any relevant media (for example, images) you would like to include.
