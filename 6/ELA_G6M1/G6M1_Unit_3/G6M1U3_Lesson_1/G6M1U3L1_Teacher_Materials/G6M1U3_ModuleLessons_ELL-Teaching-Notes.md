English Language Learners: Grade 6: Module 1: Unit 3: Teaching Notes

Research to Create a New Character and Write a Narrative

Teaching Notes for Unit 3

Prioritize Lessons for Classrooms with Many English Language Learners

To prepare for the Unit 3 assessments, prioritize and expand instruction in Lesson 2, in which a Close Read and Language Dive prepare students to identify and summarize central ideas, preparing them for the mid-unit assessment; Lesson 3, in which students first begin to develop the character that they will write about during the end of unit assessment; and Lesson 5, in which students analyze a model narrative, whose structure and pacing they can apply to their own narratives. The Language Dives of Lessons 2 and 8 support reading abilities for students at all proficiency levels though are particularly critical for ELLs, as these approaches accelerate language development. Lessons 6, 7, and 8 are similar and give students class time to independently plan their narratives. Depending on where students are struggling, modify these lessons to target students’ specific needs.

Language Dives

Unit 3 features two Language Dives. In Lesson 2, students analyze a sentence from an informational text about the Greek goddess Hestia, exploring central ideas and analyzing a grammatical structure they can use in their own writing (*on/in/of which*). A Language Dive empowers students to analyze, understand, and use the language of academic sentences, which often seems opaque to students. During a Language Dive, students slow down for 10–20 minutes to have a conversation about the meaning, purpose, and structure of a compelling sentence from a complex text, or from a learning target, checklist, or rubric included in the curriculum. Following the engaging deconstruct-reconstruct-practice routine of the Language Dive, students play with the smallest “chunks” of the sentence, interpreting them, rearranging them, or using them to talk about their own lives. As a result of paying close attention to how language works, all students begin to acquire the necessary facility with academic English, and ELLs foster their overall language ability. A consistent Language Dive routine is critical in helping all students learn how to decipher complex sentences and write their own.

Most Language Dives implicitly address a wide range of Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening, and Language standards. Once comfortable with Language Dives, supplement the focus standards in a particular Language Dive with additional standards to meet students’ needs. Note that the Rationale section of each Language Dive also identifies supporting standards that are explicitly addressed but are not the main focus of the Language Dive.

Note: Some responses to questions in the Language Dive indicate only that “Responses will vary.” Like one of the larger goals of Language Dives, “Responses will vary” is intended to suggest that students should be encouraged to grapple with questions and ideas, develop interest and participation, and not be immediately steered toward “correct” responses. Indeed, even where correct responses are provided, continue to invite a culture of inquiry and grappling.

Diversity and Inclusion

Investigate the routines, practices, rituals, beliefs, norms, and experiences that are important to ELLs and their families. Integrate this background into the classroom as students engage with texts. Consider the values and narratives embedded in class texts, and try to anticipate their relevance to ELLs. Challenge students to identify and interrogate any problematic points of view and language of the author and narrator. Encourage and welcome critical questions, and guide students toward awareness and empathy. Foster inclusive action by creating space for students to express their feelings about sensitive issues or content embedded in the text(s), knowing that these discussions may help create equity, amplify student voices, and/or unearth trauma. Consult with a guidance counselor, school social worker, or ESL teacher for further investigation of diversity and inclusion. Note that the end of unit assessment requires that students conduct independent research of a Greek god or goddess and rewrite a scene of *The Lightning Thief* from the first-person perspective of the god’s or goddess’s child. Be sensitive to ways in which this exercise may conflict with the religious views of students and their families. Be prepared to offer alternative parameters for the assessment; for example, students may have the option to choose a different historical or literary figure on which to base their character.

Conversation Cues

Encourage productive and equitable conversation with Conversation Cues to achieve four goals:

- (Goal 1) encourage all students to talk and be understood;

- (Goal 2) listen carefully to one another and seek to understand;

- (Goal 3) deepen thinking; and

- (Goal 4) think with others to expand the conversation (adapted from Michaels, Sarah and O’Connor, Cathy. *Talk Science Primer*. TERC, 2012. http://inquiryproject.terc.edu/shared/pd/TalkScience_Primer.pdf. Based on Chapin, S., O’Connor, C., and Anderson, N. *Classroom Discussions: Using Math Talk to Help Students Learn, Grades K–6*. Second Edition. Math Solutions Publications, 2009).

Refer to the Tools Page (http://eled.org/tools) for the complete set of cues. Suggestions for integrating Goal 1 Conversation Cues into instruction are presented across lessons. For ELLs, Conversation Cues are especially critical because they improve language processing abilities and increase engagement and participation. Goal 2 Conversation Cues are introduced in this unit.

Strategic Grouping

As much as possible, facilitate opportunities in class for groups to discuss and complete content and tasks. In Unit 3, students may work in pairs and small groups to read the anchor text, provide peer feedback on assignments, and share developing characters and scenes with classmates before the end of unit assessment. Vary these groups so that ELLs have opportunities to interact with a wide variety of speakers in different situations, thus expanding the opportunity for language development. For particularly challenging tasks, think about strategically grouping ELLs with native and proficient English speakers. For more manageable tasks, interacting in homogeneous proficiency groups may promote English language development through grappling. At times, grouping speakers of the same home language may facilitate development of home language in association with content, boosting students’ connectedness to in-class material.

Performance Task

In Lesson 12, students will participate in a performance task, which is a presentation in which they share their research and the narrative they have developed during the unit. The performance task requires that students develop a multimedia slideshow to accompany their presentation. ELLs may feel intimidated by the performance task, especially if they feel nervous about their speaking skills. Remind students that the performance task is not formally assessed; rather, it is an opportunity for students to share and celebrate their and their classmates’ work and imagination.

Differentiated Note-Catchers

Differentiated note-catchers are available for ELLs and other students who would benefit from an increased level of support. These resources have been modified for the purposes of creating accessibility to content and concepts and supporting language development. Depending upon the task being carried out with a note-catcher, images, selected response options, answer banks, sentence frames, or model responses have been embedded to guide students’ thinking without compromising a focus on standards and the skills that students are developing and applying to meet them.

Celebration

Celebrate the courage, enthusiasm, diversity, and bilingual assets that ELLs bring to the classroom. Additionally, students can celebrate their successful attempts at communication and their ability to extend and enhance the discussions.
