Greek Mythology

Grade 6: Module 1: Unit 3: Lesson 7

Lesson Overview

Lesson Summary

Students read from the final chapter in the anchor text, *The Lightning Thief*. They continue to plan their narratives, using their analysis of the model narrative to determine where to insert their new character. Students strategically edit the original scene, determining what to keep and what to change.

Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.6.3 – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they compare two sentences describing the same sequence of events and evaluate them for their effectiveness.

- RL.6.1 – Work Time A: Students read the next chapter of the text and find the gist. Students also unpack unfamiliar vocabulary and answer comprehension questions using inferences and evidence from text.

- W.6.3 – Work Time B: Students use the same graphic organizer from the previous lesson to plan their character and scene insertion. Students finish developing their demigod character and complete their planning of their scene into which they will insert this character. Students may not complete all of their planning in this lesson and will have time in Lesson 8 to complete the planning before the assessment in Lesson 9.

- W.6.4 – Work Time B: Using the model narrative as guidance, students continue to plan a clear and coherent narrative, with attention to task, purpose, and audience.

- W.6.5 – Closing and Assessment A: Students share their Narrative Writing Plan graphic organizers with a partner. Remind students that any feedback they provide should be kind, specific, and helpful. Additionally, stress that the first draft of a plan is rarely the best draft; tell students that their ideas will evolve and improve over time.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Make the Pair Share in Closing and Assessment A more interactive by incorporating a movement protocol.

- Students who have completed their planning may benefit from acting out their scene to identify areas that require more clarification.

- Challenge students to experiment with more advanced writing techniques, such as adding figures of speech (L.6.5a) or varying sentence patterns (L.6.3a).

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the previous lesson, students began planning their narrative using the graphic organizer. While their initial work was focused on developing the key attributes of their character and incorporating the research on their Greek god or goddess, this lesson focuses on the second part of the graphic organizer, in which they determine which scene to rewrite.

Support All Students

- Successfully developing a new character and planning the scene revision depends first on students’ understanding of the scene and the Greek god parent they have selected. Make sure to provide opportunities for students and/or groups to ask questions throughout Work Time B, frequently referring back to their research from Lesson 3 or extending their research as the character evolves.

- Some students may not be able to spontaneously come up with ideas for their original character and scene insertion. A number of digital, interactive online tools can be leveraged, such as character name generators or storyboarding sites, to inspire ideas and help students gain momentum with their writing.

- To support ELLs, this lesson provides more time for students to plan the narrative writing that they will complete during the End of Unit 3 Assessment. Planning time allows ELLs to explore and organize their ideas and ask questions. In Lesson 7, students will also complete *The Lightning Thief*, which, for some ELLs, may be the first full-length English language text they have read. The lesson encourages making time for celebration and reflection.

- ELLs may find it challenging to manage their independent planning time. Work with individual students to create writing goals that are appropriate for them. These goals can be designed to help students move along at an effective pace (e.g., Complete two-thirds of page 2 by the end of Work Time A.) or to support language development (e.g., Use a thesaurus to find synonyms for three words of the scene you’re revising.), while still nurturing independence and ownership of their own learning.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.B.6, 6.II.A.2, 6.II.B.3, 6.II.B.4, 6.II.C.6, and 6.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- Use the Narrative Writing Checklist to assess students’ writing abilities in Work Time B.

- Circulate and monitor as students complete the Narrative Writing Plan graphic organizer. Set up writing conferences to ensure that students understand the requirements of the assignment and to push students’ thinking.

- Students will likely not finish all of their planning during this lesson. They will have one more lesson in which to finish planning before the assessment.

Down the Road

- Students will have one more lesson in which to plan their narrative before writing it for the End of Unit 3 Assessment in Lesson 9. They will also engage in one last Language Dive focused on point of view, a key aspect of their narrative.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Review the student tasks and example answers to understand what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Preread chapter 22 in *The Lightning Thief* to identify words or plot points that may challenge students.

- Prepare copies of handouts for students, including entrance ticket (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time B: Use an online storyboarding tool, such as http://eled.org/0135, to help students organize their ideas around their original character.

- Work Time B: Students complete their Narrative Writing Plan graphic organizer in a word-processing document such as a Google Doc.

- Work Time B and Closing and Assessment A: Encourage active participation in the lesson by utilizing an interactive audience feedback tool. An interactive tool helps to instantly identify gaps in understanding during the model analysis and note students’ progress toward the learning targets in Closing and Assessment A.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.6.3a (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 7**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

- Turn and Talk:

“What do you think you will be doing in this lesson based on these learning targets?” (We are going to be planning how we’ll incorporate our characters into the scene we have chosen, what will stay the same, and what can change without impacting the way the original scene ends.)

- Tell students that before they begin planning their narratives, they will read an excerpt from the final chapter of the novel.

Work Time

A. Read *The Lightning Thief*, Chapter 22 Excerpt – RL.6.1 (20 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Read aloud the selected excerpt, using **Text Guide: *The Lightning Thief*** **(for teacher reference)** for comprehension and vocabulary questions as needed. Students continue to record the gist on **sticky notes**, unpack and record unfamiliar vocabulary, and reflect on their reading as they choose. Refer to the following resources as appropriate to support this section of the lesson: **Gist Record: *The Lightning Thief*** **anchor chart (example for teacher reference)**, **vocabulary logs**, **chapter synopsis**, and **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart**.

- Excerpt: Read from page 361 (“Don’t think about leaving yet”) to page 372 (“Your time will come”).

- Gist: Luke reveals himself as the thief helping Cronus to start the war between gods. Grover leaves for his quest, Annabeth goes home with her father and stepmother, and Percy returns to his mother for the school year.

- Direct students to the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**. Congratulate them on showing perseverance as they worked through a long and complex text. Note that completing an entire book in English may be an especially exciting accomplishment for ELLs; allow opportunities for celebration and reflection. ▲

- Invite students to share their reactions and reflections of the book now that they’ve finished.

For Lighter Support

- In Work Time A, before students finish *The Lightning Thief*, invite them to make predictions about how the story will end based on the events of previous chapters. Provide sentence frames, if necessary, to guide students’ answers.

For Heavier Support

- After students complete *The Lightning Thief* in Work Time A, facilitate a short discussion that acknowledges students’ reading successes and explores areas of future growth for developing readers. This will give ELLs an opportunity to celebrate their accomplishments, self-assess, and prepare for future texts.

Work Time

B. Plan Scene – W.6.3 (15 minutes)

- Review the learning targets relevant to the work to be completed in this section of the lesson:

”I can demonstrate understanding of the excerpt from chapter 22 of *The Lightning Thief*.”

”I can determine where to insert my new character into and plan to revise the original scene so that it doesn’t change the outcome of the story.”

- Invite students to retrieve their **Narrative Writing Plan graphic organizer**, **Model Narrative: “Greek God: Hypnos”**, and **Narrative Writing checklist**. Remind students that during this lesson and the next, they will continue planning their revised scene. They will actually write their narrative during Lesson 9.

- Select a volunteer to read aloud the headings on page 2 of the organizer, clarifying as needed. If students need additional support in understanding the organizer, share the **Narrative Writing Plan graphic organizer (example for teacher reference)** that goes with the narrative model. ▲

- Direct students to reread their chosen scene and then work individually to begin the scene section on page 2 of Narrative Writing Plan graphic organizer.

- Circulate and support students as they plan. Remind them to be creative but to remember that their narratives should be based on a scene from *The Lightning Thief*, and to refer to their research and the Model Narrative as they plan.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Closing and Assessment

A. Pair Share – W.6.5 (5 minutes)

- Direct students to share their Narrative Writing Plan graphic organizer with their partner.

- Remind students to check the Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart before they share.

- Students may exchange graphic organizers or present their scene ideas with their partner. Circulate to support pairs as they share. Reassure students that they might not have completed their planning right now, but they will have more time during the next lesson.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their independent reading journal.
