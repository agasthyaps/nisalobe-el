Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 7

W.6.3

(For Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Read the sentences below. Explain what you notice about how the two are similar and different. How can studying these two sets of sentences help us write our own narratives?

1.  I steered Grover and Annabeth toward the exit, loaded them into the elevator, and was about to get in myself when I realized there were already two other tourists inside. No room for me. (206)

2.  Percy steered me, Grover, and Annabeth toward the exit, and loaded us into the elevator. Because of the two tourists already inside, there wasn’t room for him.

Answers will vary. Sample student response: The sentence sets are similar in that they both tell of the same event—getting into the elevator on the St. Louis Arch. The sentences are different in that the point of view changes. Sentence set 1 is from the book and is from Percy’s point of view, and sentence set 2 is from the model narrative and from Parker’s point of view. Studying these sentences helps us write our own narratives because they show the types of adjustments we will need to make to the language to change the point of view.
