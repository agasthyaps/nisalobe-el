Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 8

W.6.3a

(For Teacher Reference)

**Directions:** Read from page 356 “As Annabeth . . .” to page 357 “‘. . . wish me luck.’”

Revise this passage to change the point of view from that of Percy to Grover.

Sample student response:

Percy and Annabeth were spreading out a picnic blanket as I walked up to them.

“I’m off. I just came to say . . . well, you know.”

Percy looked at me with a conflicting gaze. Annabeth gave me a hug and told me to keep my fake feet on.

“Where are you going to search first?” Percy asked. I looked at the ground and hesitated briefly before answering.

“Kind of a secret,” I could feel myself blushing. “I wish you could come with me, guys, but humans and Pan . . .”

Annabeth spoke up and expressed that they understood. She continued, “You got enough tin cans for the trip?”

I answered, “Yeah.”

“And you remembered your reed pipes?”

I sighed and grumbled, “Jeez, Annabeth, you’re like an old mama goat.” I gripped my walking stick and slung a backpack over my shoulder.

“Well, wish me luck.”
