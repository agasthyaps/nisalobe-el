W.6.3

(For Teacher Reference)

**Sentence**

**As Annabeth and I were spreading a picnic blanket,** Grover showed up to tell us good-bye. (from page 356 of *The Lightning Thief* by Rick Riordan)

**Rationale**

- Daily Learning Target and Focus Standards: The sentence helps to address the daily learning target and W.6.3 by demonstrating a way to introduce a new character into a scene in a narrative using a grammatical structure that accommodates one action “interrupting” another.

- Supporting Standards: SL.6.1

- Guiding Question: The sentence helps respond to a big idea of the module (stories from Greek mythology have remained relatable because they can be imagined to fit different environments and time periods) because it shows mythological characters having normal human friendships.

- Language Structure: This sentence is compelling because it uses a conjunction (**as**) to show a sequence of events and establish pacing. Invite students to discuss each chunk briefly, but encourage extended conversation and practice with the focus structure: **As Annabeth and I were spreading a picnic blanket,**

- Practice and Transfer: After discussing the focus structure, students practice using it to discuss something in their lives. Students transfer their understanding of the meaning and structure of this sentence when introducing new characters to a scene during the End-of-Unit 3 Assessment.

- Delivery: The chunks are presented out of order to provide context for the reason presented in the final chunk, allowing for better understanding and discussion.

“<u>Now</u> what do you think is the meaning of this sentence?” (Responses will vary.)

“How does the Language Dive add to your understanding of the learning target, I can determine where to insert my new character into the scene so that it doesn’t change the outcome of the story?” (Responses will vary. If students are stuck, encourage them to think about how this sentence introduces a character to the scene. Students can use a similar structure to insert their brand-new characters into the text.)
