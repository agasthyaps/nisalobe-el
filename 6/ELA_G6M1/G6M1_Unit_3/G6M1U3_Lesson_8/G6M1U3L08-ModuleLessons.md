Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- W.6.3a – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket in which they change the point of view in a passage from that of Percy to Grover. This activity helps students make writing choices that orient the reader, including clearly establishing a narrator.

- W.6.3 – Work Time A: Students compare selections from the text to sentences from the model narrative, noting effective techniques for narrative writing.

- W.6.4 – Work Time B: Students continue planning their character and scene insertion. Students finish developing their demigod character and complete their planning of their scene into which they will insert this character. This is the final lesson in which class time has been allotted for planning the narrative.

- W.6.3 – Work Time C: Students participate in a Language Dive using a sentence from *The Lightning Thief*. This sentence uses a dependent clause and past continuous verb phrase (*As Annabeth and I were spreading a picnic blanket*) to set the scene before a new character is introduced (*Grover showed up to tell us good-bye*). This frame provides an effective way to sequence events, which students can use when writing themselves into scenes during the End of Unit 3 Assessment.

- W.6.5 – Closing and Assessment A: Students share their developed character and scene plans with a partner. Remind students that any feedback they provide should be kind, specific, and helpful. Remind students that, at this point in their planning, their ideas for their character and revised scene should be largely developed and decisions finalized.

- In this lesson, students focus on working to contribute to a better world, using their strengths when working with a partner to give and receive feedback on their plans.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Make the Pair Share in Closing and Assessment A more interactive by incorporating a movement protocol.

- Students who have completed their planning may benefit from acting out their scene to identify areas that require more clarification.

- Challenge students to experiment with more advanced writing techniques, such as adding figures of speech (L.6.5a) or varying sentence patterns (L.6.3a).

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Students have been planning their narratives for the previous three lessons. This lesson is the culmination of the planning time before the End of Unit 3 Assessment, in which they compose their narrative.

Support All Students

- Record students as they engage in Language Dive discussions to listen to later so as to discuss strengths and areas of improvement or to use as models for the group.

- Better prepare students for the Language Dive by drawing upon students’ prior knowledge (e.g., by reminding them about clauses and verb tenses).

- Reimagining a scene from the novel and inserting themselves as a demigod may be uncomfortable for some students whose religious views are in conflict with this assignment. Check in with students to ensure that they are still satisfied with the alternative option arranged for them.

- To support ELLs, this lesson incorporates additional time for students to plan the insertion of their character into a scene of *The Lightning Thief*. Additionally, this lesson features a Language Dive that uses a clause (*As Annabeth and I were spreading a picnic blanket*,) to set a scene before the introduction of another character and additional action (*Grover showed up to tell us good-bye*). This grammatical structure can be repurposed in students’ narrative writing, as they sequence events and add new characters to a scene.

- ELLs may find it challenging to apply the focus structure of the Language Dive to the writing of their own narratives. Add extra time to the Practice section of the Language Dive to review students’ sentences and offer suggestions.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.II.A.1, 6.II.A.2, 6.II.B.3, 6.II.B.4, 6.II.C.6, and 6.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- In the next lesson, students need to be ready to complete the end of unit assessment. Ensure that students are on track to be ready for the assessment, and check in with students who are falling behind.

- Closely monitor students who have been given permission to choose an alternative figure as they approach the assessment lesson to ensure that the modifications are still in line with the objectives of the assessment.

Down the Road

- In the next lesson, students will use their plans to write their narratives for the End of Unit 3 Assessment. Students will also begin preparing for the performance task, in which they create a multimedia presentation of their narrative to share with their peers.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – W.6.3a (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 8**.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

- Remind students that that this will be the final planning lesson before they write their narratives during Lesson 9.

For Lighter Support

- If time allows, provide students with a list of all the learning targets they have seen so far in Unit 3, and encourage them to “map” the targets and their relationships to one another. This will help students see the larger picture of what they are working toward and how each lesson’s goals are connected.

For Heavier Support

N/A

Work Time

A. Compare Model with Text – W.6.3 (10 minutes)

- Invite students to retrieve their **Narrative Writing Plan graphic organizer**, **Model Narrative: “Greek God: Hypnos”**, and **Narrative Writing checklist**.

- Distribute and display **Model Narrative Comparison with Text**. Read the directions aloud, and direct students to work in pairs to complete the comparisons. Each pair could be assigned one or two sections rather than completing the entire handout. Students could continue working on the comparison if needed for homework or during other available time. Refer to **Model Narrative Comparison with Text (example for teacher reference)** as needed.

- After about 5 minutes, direct students to Think-Pair-Share in response to the following questions:

“What do you notice about how the model uses the text from the novel?” (It keeps some key details and moments; it starts and ends in the same place; it retains the events of the scene; it shifts the perspective, making Percy another character rather than the narrator; the new character is the narrator, and the scene is told from her point of view.)

“What do you notice about what from the text was left out of the model?” (Some minor details or information not relevant to the events of the story or to the new character were left out; the scene wasn’t changed by the deletion of the details.)

“What do you notice about the new content that was added to the model?” (Information about the new character and the new character’s parent was added, the point of view has shifted to the new character, it tells some things that weren’t finished in the novel—what happens to the other characters after Percy jumps.)

- Facilitate a quick discussion of their observations. If productive, use Goal 2 Conversation Cues to help students seek to understand their classmates’ comments.

“Who can tell us what your classmate said in your own words?”

- Remind students to keep these ideas in mind and use the model comparison as they continue to plan their narratives in this lesson and when they write in the next lesson.

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time A, as a way to nurture student independence and gradually lessen support, observe student progress from a distance, and allow time for students to grapple. Provide supportive frames, demonstrations, or suggestions only after students have grappled with the task on their own.

Work Time

B. Plan Scene – W.6.3 (10 minutes)

- Direct students to work individually or with a partner to continue planning their scene using the Narrative Writing Plan graphic organizer. Suggest that they use **sticky notes** to indicate in their **text** what sections from their scene they might keep, what might be cut, and what they might add.

- Circulate and support students as they plan. Remind them to be creative but to remember that their narratives should be based on a scene from *The Lightning Thief*, and to refer to their research and the Model Narrative as they plan.

- For added vocabulary practice, encourage students to draw words from their **vocabulary logs** and incorporate them into their revised scenes. ▲

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Work Time

C. Language Dive: *The Lightning Thief*, Page 356 – W.6.3 (15 minutes)

- Tell students they will now participate in a Language Dive to examine a sentence from chapter 22 of *The Lightning Thief*. In this sentence, a character (Grover) is introduced to a scene in which two other characters (Annabeth and Percy) are doing something different. The structure of the sentence provides a good model for moving action along and adding characters to a scene.

- Focus students on the sentence:

“As Annabeth and I were spreading a picnic blanket, Grover showed up to tell us good-bye.”

- Use the **Language Dive Guide: *The Lightning Thief***, **Page 356 (for teacher reference)** to guide students through a Language Dive conversation about the sentence. Distribute and display the **Language Dive: *The Lightning Thief***, **Page 356 note-catcher**, and the **Language Dive: *The Lightning Thief***, **Page 356 sentence chunk strips**.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

For Heavier Support

- The Language Dive of Work Time C requires a general understanding of past progressive (e.g., *were spreading*) and past simple (e.g., *showed up*) verb tenses. If students are unfamiliar with these structures, begin the Dive with a brief lesson orienting students to their form and use. The most important thing for students to know as they begin the Language Dive is that the past progressive is used to describe actions that last for a period of time, and that the past simple tense can be used to describe a shorter action that interrupts the first.

- During the Practice (Focus Structure) section of the Language Dive, provide students with phrases to fill in the sentence frames. Students can choose the best answer for the frame, rather than generating their own responses (e.g., *the friends were eating lunch; the students were taking a test; the teacher was giving directions*).

Closing and Assessment

A. Pair Share – W.6.5 (10 minutes)

- Explain that, in a moment, students will be sharing their Narrative Writing Plan graphic organizers with a partner.

- Focus students on the **Work to Contribute to a Better World anchor chart**. Explain, as it says at the top of the anchor chart, that they can use their learning to improve their communities.

- Read aloud the habit of character recorded:

“I use my strengths to help others grow.”

- Invite students to Turn and Talk to their partner:

“Using the anchor chart as a guide, what does this mean in your own words?” (helping someone with something I can do well; providing kind, helpful, specific peer feedback)

- As students share out, capture their responses in the appropriate column on the Work to Contribute to a Better World anchor chart. Refer to **Work to Contribute to a Better World anchor chart (example for teacher reference)** as necessary.

- Direct students to keep this habit of character in mind as they engage in their final Pair Share before the assessment.

- Students may exchange graphic organizers or present their ideas to their partner orally. Circulate to support pairs as they share. Reassure students that they might not have completed their planning right now, but they will have more time during the next lesson.

- Invite students to reflect on the habit of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their independent reading journal.
