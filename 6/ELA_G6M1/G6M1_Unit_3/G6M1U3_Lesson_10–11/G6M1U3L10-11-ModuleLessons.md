Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- L.6.3a – Opening A: Students complete an entrance ticket, which invites them to practice varying the length of their sentences.

- SL.6.5 – Work Time B: Students prepare their multimedia presentations.

- SL.6.4 – Closing and Assessment A: In pairs, students give one another feedback on their presentation skills in order to improve eye contact, volume, and clarity of pronunciation.

- In this lesson, students review the specifications of the performance task, for which they will create and deliver a multimedia presentation explaining their narrative choices: choice of Greek god (or a character from another traditional story), new character choices, choice of scene from *The Lightning Thief* to revise, and how and why they revised that scene. Students present to a live audience, including reading their revised scene aloud.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Challenge students to learn new presentation programs, such as PowToons, or try their hand at the more advanced features of slideshow software of which they are already familiar.

- Demonstrate the relevance of narrative writing with insight from a professional storyteller. Have students view an excerpt (1:19–2:53) of Pixar filmmaker Andrew Stanton’s TED Talk, “The Clues to a Great Story” (http://eled.org/0157).

How It Builds on Previous Work

- In the second half of this unit, students have been reimagining a scene from *The Lightning Thief* and rewriting it to incorporate a new character. In the previous lesson, students used their research, planning, and narrative writing checklist to write their original narrative scene. Students will now prepare to showcase their learning in a multimedia presentation as a culmination to this unit and this module.

Support All Students

- Remember that students who were uncomfortable with the original premise of the rewritten narrative (with themselves as a child of a Greek god or goddess) may also be uncomfortable hearing their peers’ presentations on this topic. Be prepared with an alternative option for students in this situation, allowing them to work in a different location on a different, but related, task.

- Encourage students to incorporate many visual components into their slideshow presentations. This will provide a more manageable workload for some ELLs, for whom writing is especially challenging. ▲ Point students toward free resources that provide high-quality images, such as Unsplash or Pixabay, for students who are not inclined toward original illustrations. Remind students that it is the thinking and presentation skills that are being practiced; students are not being assessed on their artistic talents.

- To support ELLs, this lesson links reading, writing, speaking, listening, and language skills through a performance task. The multimedia presentation invites creativity, is built upon planning done over many lessons, and, because the performance task is not formally assessed, inspires confidence.

- ELLs may find it challenging to remediate their ideas from a written narrative to a visual, multimedia format. Remind them to use the additional handouts and scaffolded models that were suggested as supports in Lesson 1.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.3, 6.I.C.9, and 6.I.C.12.

Assessment Guidance

- The performance tasks at the end of every module are neither formative nor summative assessments. They are not formative since they come at the end of the module, concluding students’ learning about the module topic and the literacy skills they have built over eight or nine weeks. However, they are also not summative because they are heavily scaffolded to help students create high-quality work, and so are not a strong measure of what students can do independently. For these reasons, we do not recommend analyzing performance tasks with the same lens used to analyze assessments. Look at students’ performance tasks through the lens of the attributes of high-quality student work (authenticity, complexity, craftsmanship).

- In this lesson students are introduced to some characteristics of effective presentation. Use the Speaking and Listening Informal Assessment: Presentation of Knowledge and Ideas checklist (see Assessment Overview and Resources) to informally assess their presentations, using only the relevant categories which are reflected in the student checklist that students work with during this lesson.

Down the Road

- Students will present their performance tasks in Lesson 12 to conclude Unit 3 and Module 1.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare:

- Necessary technology for student presentations (see Technology and Multimedia).

- An order or system for presentations, depending on how students will present.

- Students will need to have access to their narratives since they will present them as part of their presentation. If students wrote those with help of technology, they could just print an additional copy after submitting theirs for assessment in Lesson 9. If not, return their submitted copies and collect again to assess them at a later time.

- Review the Model Performance Task Slideshow, and rehearse the model presentation to represent the expectations for student presentations in Lesson 12.

- Consider how to engage and sustain effort and persistence throughout the lesson, as students will not be formally assessed on their performance task presentations. Remind students of the many “real-world” applications of effective public speaking skills. Focus students on the joy of learning for learning’s sake.

- Review the student tasks and example answers to understand what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Prepare copies of handouts for students, including entrance ticket (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time A: Prepare technology to show model presentations—for example, a projector or an interactive board.

- Work Time B: Prepare technology for students to create their presentations. Choose the level of technology that is appropriate for the students and school resources, and guide students accordingly.

- Work Time B: Introduce students to a number of alternative slideshow tools to PowerPoint, such as Sway, Prezi, Haiku Deck, or Google Slides.

- Work Time B: Search for PowerPoint do’s and don’ts to model examples (and humorous non-examples) of how students should design their presentations.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner – L.6.3a (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 10**.

- Invite a few students to share their combined sentences. Encourage them to use these sentence combining strategies as they work on their presentations.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

- With students, use the vocabulary strategies on the **Close Readers Do These Things anchor chart** to deconstruct the term *multimedia presentation* (a speech that also uses a combination of words, graphics, images, video, music, sound). Record on the **domain-specific word wall** with translations in home languages, where appropriate, ▲ and invite students to record in their **vocabulary logs**.

- Clarify what is meant by *slideshow software* as it is appropriate and relevant to the classroom resources and student knowledge (e.g., PowerPoint, Google Slides, Prezi, Canva). ▲

- Turn and Talk:

“What do you think you will be doing in this lesson based on this learning target?” (We’re going to be creating a multimedia presentation to share our research and narratives with the class.)

“Why are we doing this? How is it meaningful to you? How will it help you to be successful?” (Since we have all researched different Greek gods/goddesses, by sharing our research we can learn from one another more about our topic, and we get to hear the other narratives our classmates created. Additionally, practicing and getting comfortable giving presentations is a skill we will use in many aspects of our lives.)

Work Time

A. Review Performance Task – SL.6.4 (15 minutes)

- Focus students on the **Performance Task anchor chart**, and remind them of what this work has been leading to. Continue to remind students of the goal for the work they are doing with their presentations. Returning to the learning goals lifts up their value and relevance to students.

- Distribute and display the **Presentation checklist**. Review the criteria and then explain that students are going to view a model presentation of the model performance task slideshow they’ve analyzed earlier in this unit.

- Clarify what is meant by “clear pronunciation.” Make sure ELLs, and the partners with whom they work in class, understand that unaccented speech is not the goal. Remind all students that the goal is understandable speech, and that this may look and sound different for different students. ▲

- Instruct them to put a check mark next to any of the criteria as they listen to the model presentation. Let students know they should be prepared to share these observations after the presentation.

- Model the performance task multimedia presentation, using the **Model Performance Task Slideshow printout** and **Model Narrative: “Greek God: Hypnos”**, or with another sample.

- After the model presentation, ask and give students 1 minute to think before inviting volunteers to share with the whole group:

“What characteristics did you notice during the presentation? What specifically can you point to from the presentation that meets that criteria?” (appropriate eye contact, adequate volume, and clear pronunciation)

- Field any outstanding questions about the specifics of the presentation if needed.

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time A, work with individual students to develop personal pronunciation goals. More reachable goals may target intonation (e.g., *pausing at commas, letting the voice sink at periods*) instead of sound-specific pronunciation (e.g., *the sound of r versus l*).

For Heavier Support

- Some students may be less accustomed to presentation norms. During Work Time A, provide students with a short list of stock phrases or sentence frames that they can reference to introduce and/or conclude their presentations, or to transition from slide to slide (e.g., *“To begin, \_\_\_\_\_,”; “As you can see, \_\_\_\_\_\_,”*).

Work Time

B. Prepare Presentations – SL.6.5 (60 minutes)

- Display the Performance Task anchor chart, and read through the directions aloud.

- Invite students to take out their **narratives**, their **Greek God Research note-catcher**, and the Model Performance Task Slideshow printout and begin creating their presentations, using the resources available. If students do not have their own copies of their narratives, please return the ones they submitted for assessment during Lesson 9, and then re-collect them after the presentations. Remind students they will only have an hour in class to work on the presentations, so they should plan accordingly.

- Focus students on the **Work to Become Effective Learners anchor chart**. Draw their attention to the habit of character *initiative*. Remind students of what this means and what it looks like (I see what needs to be done and take the lead on making responsible decisions; doing things without being asked).

- As students work, circulate to answer questions, push their thinking, and provide support as needed. Remind them to review the model and the anchor chart to help them make decisions and to also use one another as thought-partners.

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

Closing and Assessment

A. Partner Share – SL.6.4 (10 minutes)

- Focus students on the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart** before they share. Draw their attention to the habits of character respect, empathy, and compassion, and remind them to keep these in mind as they work with their partners.

- Direct students to pair up and present just their slide(s) about the parent god/goddess to each other for feedback.

- As each one listens to the other, they should track their partner using the Presentation checklist. Then each partner gives one star and one step to help improve the presentation.

- Once pairs are done sharing, field any new questions about the specifics of the presentation and clarify the logistics of the next lesson, when they will present.

- Invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

- If students seem especially nervous about their slide presentations, encourage them to practice their presentations aloud at home, if possible. They may wish to record themselves to locate areas in need of further practice. ▲

Homework

A. Independent Research Reading

- Students read for at least 20 minutes in their independent research reading text. Then they select a prompt and write a response in their independent reading journal.
