I chose Hypnos because I really like to sleep, and he seemed like an interesting god to find out more about. He is the son of Erebus and Nyx. He has a twin brother—the god of death. He has four sons—all gods of dreams. And for my narrative, he also has a daughter, whom you’ll learn more about shortly!

He lives in a cave in the underworld with his twin brother—in Erebus, where the River Lethe (which means forgetfulness) starts and where night and day meet. He can use sleep for good or for bad. He carries a poppy stem and a branch (or cup) with water from the River Lethe. He has wings sprouting from the sides of his head, near his temples, or sometimes shown near his eyebrows. He is thought to be a calm and gentle god, helping humans in need.

Here is a bust of Hypnos. If you look closely, you can see a wing on the side of his head. And here is an image of a poppy, Hypnos’s secret ingredient for putting people to sleep.

I based this character on myself and my own characteristics. I like all of the things that she likes, especially sleep! As I was writing the story I was thinking about how I might behave in that situation. A lot of what she experiences is what I would experience in the same situation, like panicking in challenging situations. Her kitty’s name is Azlin, which means a night vision or dream.

This is what Parker looks like: 5’6”, short black hair, athletic build, brown eyes. She likes to wear comfortable but modern, sporty clothing with high-top sneakers. She carries dried plants and flowers, ground into a powder that can be used quickly to induce sleep. She keeps these in a small drawstring bag.

![](media/image6.png)I chose this scene because I felt like what happened to all of the characters besides Percy was unresolved, so I realized that the powers my character has could be used to resolve this scene and maybe help Percy.

Echidna is the Mother of Monsters. Her son the Chimera has the head of a lion and the body of a giant goat. It has a serpent for a tail. Summary of scene:

- Annabeth wants to ride to the top of the Gateway Arch in St. Louis.

- They all go to the top of the arch.

- When they want to leave, Percy can’t fit into the elevator car going back down and so gets left at the top with some tourists.

- One of the tourists is actually Echidna and has the Chimera disguised as a Chihuahua.

- When Percy gets left behind, Echidna reveals herself, and the Chihuahua grows into the Chimera and attacks Percy.

- Percy tries to fight back but gets bitten by the venomous serpent tail and has to jump into the Mississippi River to escape.

- We never know the fate of the other characters in the scene . . .
