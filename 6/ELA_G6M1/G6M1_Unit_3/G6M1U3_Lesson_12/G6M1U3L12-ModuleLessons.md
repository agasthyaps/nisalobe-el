Guidance and Supports

Teaching Notes

Alignment to Assessment Standards and Purpose of Lesson

- SL.6.4 – Work Time B: Students present their rewritten narrative scenes from *The Lightning Thief* to an audience, using appropriate eye contact, adequate volume, and clear pronunciation. This may take longer than the allocated 30 minutes, depending on the number of students in the class. This event could work in different ways and can be altered if there is additional available time than what is allocated here. Students could present in a “poster-session,” for example, with students stationed around the room with laptops and the audience circulating around to listen. Alternatively, students could present to the audience one by one or present to their own small groups. Consider ways to best set up students for success. ▲

- SL.6.5 – Work Time B: In their presentations, students include multimedia components and visual displays to clarify the content of their narratives.

- During Closing and Assessment A, students reflect on the guiding questions for the module. Prompt students to understand the purpose and relevance of myths and how myths convey cultural values through the heroes of the stories. Remind students about all of the learning they have completed in this module—reading a novel, analyzing informational texts, and writing both an informational essay and a narrative piece. Congratulate them on demonstrating perseverance throughout the module.

Opportunities to Extend Learning

- Create an air of celebration around the performance task presentations. Invite outside audience members, such as administrators, parents, or other students.

- Share excerpts from a podcast celebrating storytelling, such as http://eled.org/0137, to showcase the craft and impact of narrative writing.

How It Builds on Previous Work

- Throughout this unit, students have been reimagining, researching, and rewriting a scene from *The Lightning Thief* in preparation for the performance task. This presentation serves as a celebration of their work in which they share their original narratives, demigod characters, and reasons for their choices.

- Continue to use Goals 1 and 2 Conversation Cues to promote productive and equitable conversation.

Support All Students

- Students may need additional support reading their presentations aloud and showing visuals. Support students with their presentations as needed.

- Students who are unable to present to a larger audience could video record their presentation, and this could be played to the audience instead of being presented live.

- Allow students to choose the order in which they will present; or if the presentation format is in small groups, allow students to choose which group they will present to.

- ELLs may find the assessment challenging, despite the days spent preparing and practicing their presentations. Allow students to practice their presentations one last time before their turn. ▲

- Remember that students who were uncomfortable with the original premise of the rewritten narrative (with themselves as a child of a Greek god or goddess) may also be uncomfortable hearing their peers’ presentations on this topic. Be prepared with an alternative option for students in this situation, allowing them to work in a different location on a different, but related, task.

- To support ELLs, this lesson consolidates the learning of Units 1–3.

- ELLs may find it challenging to share their work with the class through a multimedia presentation. Remind students of discussion norms and habits of character, and cultivate an atmosphere of support and respect.

- Supports guided in part by CA ELD Standards 6.I.A.1, 6.I.A.3, 6.I.C.9, 6.I.C.12, 6.II.C.6, and 6.II.C.7.

Assessment Guidance

- Video record students’ presentations, and watch the videos with students afterward.

Down the Road

- This is the final lesson of Module 1.

Materials and Preparation

In Advance

- Prepare:

- Necessary technology for student presentations (see Technology and Multimedia).

- An order or system for presentations, depending on how students will present.

- Students will need to have access to their narratives since they will present them as part of their presentation. If students wrote those with help of technology, they could just print an additional copy after submitting theirs for assessment in Lesson 9. If not, return their submitted copies and collect again to assess at a later time.

- Review the student tasks and example answers to understand what students will be required to do in the lesson (see Materials list).

- Prepare copies of handouts for students, including entrance ticket (see Materials list).

- Post the learning targets and applicable anchor charts (see Materials list).

Technology and Multimedia

- Work Time A: Prepare technology for students to show visuals during their presentations—for example, a projector or an interactive board. If only one is available, ensure to model for the group how to use it, and be prepared to support students with the technology in the actual presentation. Students could also show enlarged copies of images or distribute copies of their images for audience reference. Choose the level of technology that is appropriate for the students and school site, and guide students accordingly. If students are using technology for their presentations, ensure that hard copies of images have been scanned before this lesson.

- Work Time A: Video record students presenting to post on a class web page or on a portfolio app such as http://eled.org/0120 for students to watch at home with families. Most devices (cell phones, tablets, laptop computers) come equipped with free video- and audio-recording apps or software.

Lesson Plan

Opening

A. Engage the Learner (5 minutes)

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as previous lessons to distribute and review **Entrance Ticket: Unit 3, Lesson 12**. These will be shared during the closing.

- Repeated routine: Follow the same routine as the previous lessons to review learning targets and the purpose of the lesson, reminding students of any learning targets that are similar or the same as previous lessons.

- Focus students on the **Performance Task anchor chart**, and refresh their memories of what this work is all leading to. Remind students that in this lesson they will present to a live audience.

- Continue to remind students of the goal for the work they are doing with their presentations. Returning to the learning goals lifts up their value and relevance to students.

- Invite students to take out their **Performance Task presentations** and **End of Unit 3 Assessment narratives**, and help set up the presentation area(s) and technology. If students do not have their own copies of their narratives, please return the ones they submitted for assessment during Lesson 9, and then re-collect them after the presentations.

Work Time

A. Performance Task Presentations (30 minutes)

- If applicable, welcome audience members to the classroom.

- Explain the procedures and expectations for both presenters and listeners. Remind students to check the **Work to Become Ethical People anchor chart** before they share, focusing on the characteristics of respect, empathy, and compassion.

- Invite students and audience members to move to the designated area(s) of the room for the presentations and begin the presentations. Given the limited time allotted, and if additional time cannot be added, it likely makes the most sense to have students present as if doing a poster-session as noted in Teaching Notes. That way each student gets to present his or her presentation and narrative to an audience.

- Support students with presentations as necessary. Provide options for physical action by removing barriers using assistive technology and offering support as students deliver their presentations (e.g., offer alternatives for interacting with the mouse, such as help from a peer assistant).

- After all presentations have been completed, invite audience members to join in a round of applause for all presenters, and say goodbye to the guests if applicable.

- Refocus whole group.

- Ask and give students 1 minute to think before inviting volunteers to share with the whole group:

“What was a highlight of this presentation for you? Why?” (Responses will vary.)

- Display, repeat, and invite students to rephrase the question. If productive, cue students to expand the listen carefully to one another and seek to understand:

“Who can tell us what your classmate said in your own words?” (Responses will vary.)

- Give students specific, positive feedback on their presentations (e.g., “I heard a lot of you speaking at an appropriate pace and volume to be clearly understood”).

For Lighter Support

- During Work Time A, after the performance task presentations, encourage students to think of specific language or speech-related highlights of their presentations. Give examples if necessary. Examples may include

- I spoke loudly and clearly.

- I remembered to raise my voice at the end of questions.

- I paused at appropriate times throughout my presentation.

For Heavier Support

- During Work Time A, allow students to use flashcards to reduce the cognitive load imposed by memorizing their presentations.

Closing and Assessment

A. Review Guiding Questions and Big Ideas – SL.6.1 (10 minutes)

- Refocus and direct students to the **Module Guiding Questions anchor chart**. Remind them that these are the questions that have guided the work over the three units.

- Invite the students to Think-Pair-Share about the following guiding question before inviting volunteers to share with the whole group:

“What is mythology? What is the value of studying mythology from other cultures?” (A collection of stories featuring traditional figures that explain natural phenomena and convey the values of the culture. Studying stories from other cultures introduces alternative perspectives and amplifies one’s worldview.)

- If productive, encourage students to expand the conversation by giving an example:

“Can you give an example?” (Responses will vary.)

- Repeated routine: Invite students to reflect on their progress toward the relevant learning targets.

- Finally, invite students to reflect on the habits of character focus in this lesson, discussing what went well and what could be improved next time.

- Explain that this brings Module 1 to a close, and praise students’ hard work, creativity, and perseverance during these three units.

Homework

- None for this lesson.
